<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I was told by someone who is employed to inform businesses about data protection matters that, under GDPR, I would need written permission to keep the names and addresses held for the groups on my computer.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">TECHNOLOGY; Version:1</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">615 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The National Health Service is texting patients to warn they could lose alerts about hospital and doctor appointments, joining the deluge of more than 1bn &quot;GDPR&quot; messages currently hitting personal inboxes to meet an EU deadline this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GDPR, which stands for General Data Protection Regulation, has been described as the biggest overhaul of online privacy since the birth of the internet, and comes into force on Friday May 25. It gives all EU citizens the right to know what data is stored on them and to have it deleted, plus protect them from privacy and data breaches. If companies fail to comply, they can be hit with fines of up to (EURO)20m (&pound;17.5m) or 4% of global turnover. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Companies and organisations around the world - from giant corporations to charities and church groups - are now anxiously contacting users to check they are happy to carry on receiving their emails and texts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Each person in the UK is understood to have about 100 &quot;data relationships&quot; and with many companies sending out multiple reminders, the total number of GDPR emails is expected to soar above one billion by this Friday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But with GDPR fatigue setting in, and with many messages heading straight into spam boxes, the figures suggest that few people are responding. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Polling by consultancy Accenture has found that more than half of consumers are not responding to emails from brands, with about a third of people deleting the emails almost as soon as they arrive in their inbox. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some small businesses are reporting that &quot;reconfirmation&quot; rates are averaging just 10%, meaning they are losing 90% of their marketing email lists. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Up to the deadline you are going to continue to see some panic and mass communications. Then there will be a lull before it begins again, as this is an ongoing requirement,&quot; said Russell Marsh of Accenture. He is forecasting that some companies will return to direct mail to target customers, as it does not fall under the same GDPR legislation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many people are enjoying a once in a lifetime opportunity to clear out their inboxes. But while many can be safely ignored, others - such as from the NHS - will need action. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NHS message reads: &quot;The law is changing and we must get explicit permissions from patients when using their data. To continue to receive SMS text messages, reply START.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The messages are being sent from the NHS automated appointment reminder system, used by millions of people across the UK. Data rules mean that the messages are sent by each individual NHS trust rather than centrally from the NHS. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Companies are handling the new rules in different ways, as there is no prescribed format for GDPR approval. If a company has a &quot;legitimate interest&quot; in contacting a customer - such as their principal bank account - then it only needs to let the customer know that privacy details have been updated. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But if the email address had been obtained in other ways - such as a pre-ticked box - then that is not regarded as legitimate, and the company has to contact the consumer and obtain approval for further communications. Some companies are insisting users go through the rigmarole of logging in, which might entail trying to remember a password or setting up a new account.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It will be their interpretation of what they need to do to be compliant,&quot; said Robert Parker at the UK's Information Commissioner's Office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Companies are resorting to ever more desperate ways to catch the eye of users in inboxes deluged with GDPR emails. Many are in the plaintive &quot;Do you still want to hear from us?&quot; style, others warn that &quot;Time is running out&quot;, while some demand &quot;Urgent action required&quot;. Or as one flower delivery company GDPR email says: &quot;Take it or leaf it&quot;. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African countries should be nervous about the big technology companies sweeping through their economies, knocking out established businesses and crushing startups before they have had a chance to blossom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's the message from the anti-poverty charity Global Justice Now in a report that warns of an &quot;e-pocalypse&quot; across the southern hemisphere, as western firms keen to sell sophisticated digital services use their muscle to outmanoeuvre local businesses in poorer nations. Africa is seen as particularly vulnerable after decades of underinvestment that has left many countries with seemingly little option but to accept the terms laid down by the tech giants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tech companies like to project a modern, progressive image to the world. But under the surface, companies like Google, Facebook, Amazon and Uber are pursuing an agenda that could hand them dangerous levels of control over our lives and profoundly harm economic development in the global south,&quot; the report says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Industry bodies deny that there are moves to establish global rules that would force-feed western technology to developing-world countries. They say that e-commerce liberates small and medium-sized businesses to export goods they could never previously afford to sell. They also say that states' attempts to keep data in local servers prevents tech firms benefiting from economies of scale by housing data in vast hubs across the globe.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Christian Borggreen, a researcher at the Computer and Communications Industry Association (CCIA), the Geneva-based lobby group for Facebook, Netflix, BT, Amazon, eBay and others, says: &quot;Forced data localisation is on the rise globally. Since the year 2000 the number of national requirements grew from 15 to 84.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is significant, he says, because there is a risk that countries that demand data localisation &quot;do this for protectionist or censorship reasons&quot;. He is thinking of Russia and China.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is also a potential risk of damage to productivity from throwing sand in the wheels of global tech. The International Monetary Fund said last month that half of the productivity gains in the developing world came from globalisation, and much of that comes from the adoption of western technology.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Nick Dearden, head of Global Justice Now, says it is essential that developing countries retain their citizens' data within their borders to avoid the core of their economies being directed from abroad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The idea that they should be passive receivers of western technology, and borrow heavily on international financial markets to pay for it, means they become prey to the whims of foreign businesses, he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Without [keeping data local] it's so much more difficult for countries to regulate and tax industries'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Nick Dearden, Global Justice Now    </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Without [keeping data local] it's so much more difficult for countries to regulate and tax industries, for them to get really any benefits out of investment with no skills, jobs or technology transfer, or to nurture infant industries. It's the central problem with the way trade deals operate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Susan Aaronson, a digital trade expert at George Washington University in Washington DC, says fighting the adoption of international rules to protect local data privacy is the wrong approach. She argues that developing world countries &quot;could say to tech firms 'you need to pay for our data and you need to be transparent about how you use it'. They haven't so far. They've accepted the Facebook model.&quot; Separately, they could negotiate common rules for e-commerce.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nick Ashton-Hart, a trade expert who used to work at the CCIA, says the report should consider the issue of data separately from e-commerce. Whereas Dearden considers Amazon, eBay, Alibaba and other trading platforms as rent-seeking operators that suck money out of the economy, Ashton-Hart says they should be seen as giving small businesses in developing-world countries access to global markets. Allowing them, along with Facebook, Google and other global operators, to store data where they want to would create huge efficiency savings that could be passed on to local businesses and consumers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If there is a problem taxing or regulating technology transfers, intellectual property or the sale of goods and services across borders, that is an issue of local governance, says Ashton-Hart, who now works for the International Chamber of Commerce, a group that promotes UK exports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Likewise, governments can set the rules for their citizens' online privacy and do not need to do it by demanding that global firms maintain relatively small local databases. &quot;The bigger issue is that more than 100 countries have no privacy laws at all, according to Unctad, but this isn't addressed at all,&quot; says Ashton-Hart. &quot;If developing countries want to protect their nationals, that's where to start, and NGOs should be calling them out for not doing it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The issue has come into sharp focus with the EU's plan to impose new data protection rules in Europe that force companies to win the consent of users before storing personal data online, known as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It becomes law at the end of this week, and is causing huge anxiety in the tech sector and a backlash from small business that rely on customer databases to generate new business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook repatriated 70% of its international customer records to the US once it became clear that the servers hosting the data in Ireland would be subject to the rules.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dearden says the issue has become pressing since e-commerce leapt to the top of the World Trade Organisation's agenda last year in Argentina. African countries were particularly alarmed at proposals to establish a level playing field that would force them to allow trade with major foreign businesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement following the meeting, African countries signed up to a declaration by the Rwandan delegation, which said the planned rules meant small businesses would be &quot;least likely to be able to effectively compete with multinational corporations, who have become global digital leaders, and have decimated smaller&nbsp;companies&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It said these multinationals had &quot;benefited from digital industrial policies such as subsidies, R&amp;D subsidies, development of, and access to, and ownership of technologies, economies of scale, government-sponsored infrastructure, tax benefits, etc&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dearden admits developing countries are split, with some wanting to take whatever the tech firms have to offer to spur growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some on the pro side have been talked to by the developed countries. Others think it sounds nice but don't know all the implications. But WTO was a major victory for us in that formal movement on this wasn't agreed - and that's because some developing countries, especially in Africa, fought it tooth and nail.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the most advanced African countries are the most serious about protecting their domestic industries from foreign competition. Only last week, Kenya pulled out of a free trade pact with China after it decided the deal was too one-sided.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Technology is seen as solving huge problems for developing countries, from corruption to poor standards of education and healthcare, but the issue of democratic control is unlikely to go away - and is likely to prevent international agreement being reached any time soon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   An Apple a day ... the race for hi-tech healthcare                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tech industry's appetite for markets to conquer is insatiable and healthcare is a priority. Last year Tim Cook, the boss of Apple, revealed that his near-trillion-dollar company was putting healthcare at the centre of all its phone developments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apple wanted to save lives, he said. A smartphone can be your personal doctor, monitoring your health minute by minute, accessing test results and providing medical information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But this could become a serious issue if the big tech companies don't just provide the phone, but also hold the health information gathered by it - information that is in high demand from, for instance, financial services companies looking to sell products to the country's healthiest people - or to cancer patients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the UK, consultants working at the Royal Free Hospital trust in London were told last year that it had been illegal for them to approach DeepMind, an artificial intelligence firm owned by Google's parent, about developing software based on patient data from the trust.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DeepMind walked away. But it has stressed to its investors that structured health data and artificial intelligence are the next phase in the company's business plan. It wants to move into disease detection, constructing a new data infrastructure around health data, and potentially sell insurance off the back of this information. The main target is the $3tn (&pound;2.2tn) US market, but the big populations of the developing world will be in its sights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apple is in the process of setting up a network of medical clinics in the US through a subsidiary, AC Wellness. Some believe it could be a blueprint for countries unable to invest in anything more than rudimentary health systems. Nick Dearden, head of the charity Global Justice Now, says: &quot;Big tech companies see vast new markets in providing tech-based versions of healthcare and education, particularly in Africa. The problem is that such private 'solutions' are already failing the majority, because they sideline and crowd out investment in decent, high quality, universal education and healthcare, which many lower-income countries desperately need.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Education is an area of interest to Google that brings with it similar issues. Dearden says, especially when the technology literacy rate is under 30% in rural Kenya (according to an IBM Digital Villages study), and the Kenyan government is one of the most advanced users of technology in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dearden adds: &quot;Patented, tech-based education can easily be tailored to suit different income categories, with the poorest being totally shut out or given a much lower level of service than richer people. What's more, countries will be locked into services which can only be provided by specific hi-tech companies for years or decades... This should worry all of us - because Africa is a guinea pig for a world totally controlled by a handful of mega corporations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tech industry lobbyists argue that developing-world governments will benefit from billions of pounds of research and development carried out by US firms over the past decade. This will help countries put in a modern digital infrastructure, they say, and save huge sums on education and healthcare budgets. But Silicon Valley's aspirations to make the world smaller and bring people together, no matter how sincere, are being met with more cynicism than ever.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outside the West End office of a once obscure political research company, an unprecedented scene was taking place. The world watched as the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) raided Cambridge Analytica in a seven-hour hunt for evidence, something that was once more likely to appear in an episode of Line of Duty. Earlier that week, disgraced former boss Alexander Nix had fled in a car, photographers hot on his heels.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But now, officials with jackets emblazoned with &quot;ICO Enforcement&quot; trooped in. Observers joked whether the bureaucrats had bought the outfits especially for the high profile raid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It took the ICO, Britain's data regulator, days to secure the warrant amid the privacy&nbsp; furore engulfing Cambridge Analytica . But that is about to change and from May 25, if companies behave badly while handling someone's data, they can expect a similar visit . &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Out-of-date information privacy laws have allowed tech giants to revel in a Wild Western rush for data reserves, with little regard for how they encroach on consumer's privacy. But under the new General Data Protection Regulation, businesses operating in Europe face hefty fines of up to (EURO)20m (&pound;17.5m), or 4pc of global turnover, if they do not comply. Currently, the maximum fine the ICO can impose is &pound;500,000.</SPAN></P>

Just 8pc of businesses said they had completed their preparations with a month to go, according to the Federation of Small Businesses, and a third had not started.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several companies, such as mobile advertising group Verve and online game Loudout, have shut down operations in Europe altogether, suggesting the costs of complying with the regulations are often not worth the trouble. The laws have been seen as a prime example of a Silicon Valley clich&eacute;: &quot;America innovates, Europe regulates.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The consultancy Oliver Wyman estimates that FTSE 100 companies collectively could be subject to as much as &pound;5bn per year in fines, while Sia Partners estimates that the average FTSE group will spend as much as &pound;15m on ensuring GDPR compliance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is GDPR and will it affect you?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Data protection laws were not fit for the digital era,&quot; says Steve Woods, the ICO's deputy chief. &quot;There wasn't one particular incident or breach that drove the changes, it was a sense across all data protection regulators across Europe [of which there are 27] and a view that the law needed to be modernised.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The way we communicate, work and conduct our day-to-day lives has changed immensely in the past two decades, largely due to the rise of the web. With every transaction or email we fire off, data is being sent and stored by a third party. The laws presiding over how that data is protected have changed little since 1995, when the EU introduced the Data Protection Directive - when few Britons owned a PC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why do we need GDPR?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The question on everyone's lips is whether GDPR will free us from the constant, personalised marketing appearing in our email inbox, social network profiles and perhaps even on the phone.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sadly, the answer is no. So why bother? GDPR builds on existing data protection law, but makes clear distinctions for companies to understand where digital data has come from. It is hoped this will eliminate the trend for buying up cheap, third party data without asking questions about its source, and using it to send spam or make nuisance calls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many Britons may have noticed an influx of privacy policy emails arriving in their inbox recently . These are unnecessary, Mr Woods says. &quot;Organisations do not have to contact all of their customers under GDPR&quot;.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a myth, much like the idea that someone must explicitly consent to a company storing their data, which has been blown out of proportion by companies trying to sell GDPR compliance services or misinformed security spokesmen.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, the likes of Dunnhumby, which began as Tesco Clubcard and now sells data reports on customers to several global retailers, will not need to delete buying habits of customers any more than pubs will need to email every punter it collected Wi-Fi data from to ask if they minded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other myths include concerns that large companies will have to dedicate hours - one marketing company claimed 60 hours of searching per working day - and several employees to answering GDPR inquiries every day as people are granted greater powers to request to see what a private company holds on them. Some companies used GDPR as an underhand way of encouraging new sign-ups to marketing emails and newsletters, something that is against the spirit of the law.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a glance | Your data rightsIs it all good news?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Critics fear that GDPR will hamper the British economy, with the potential for fines to eat away at the profits of leading companies. Others worry it will actually strengthen the hand of US tech giants, which are best placed to navigate the new rules while small companies struggle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Companies that track or collect large amounts of user data are required to appoint a data protection officer. The market demand for these specialists has seen pay packets increasing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've seen companies of all sizes scrambling to do the absolute minimum,&quot; says Harry Keen, chief executive of Hazy, a start-up developing tools to help with GDPR compliance. &quot;The smaller the company, the less prepared they are.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are fears that companies may delete important data in an attempt to stay compliant. Labour MP Chi Onwurah told The Sunday Telegraph that she was &quot;really concerned that the way in which GDPR is being implemented will lead to the wholesale destruction of people's data without their permission and regardless of whether it is in their interests&quot;. Using the example of Windrush immigration records, Ms Onwurah warned that &quot;there is no incentive to keep people's data and there may be an incentive to destroy it if it could point the finger at particular officials&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ICO said that &quot;if an individual is concerned that their data had been deleted and they believed it was important for the organisation to retain it then we can consider complaints about that&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How will this affect businesses?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appearing before US politicians in April, Mark Zuckerberg was forced to concede that Facebook was planning to bulk up its data protection after years of playing fast and loose with the rules. Facebook has launched new tools that outline the kind of data it collects, and gives users options to opt out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We'll need to figure out what makes sense in different markets, with different laws, in different places&quot;, Facebook chief executive Mr Zuckerberg told reporters in April. &quot;But let me repeat this, we're going to make all the same controls and settings available everywhere, not just in Europe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several companies, including Facebook, have introduced new tools to get users to approve their privacy policy. However, it has also made accepting its privacy terms a condition of using Facebook. This could be found to be against the spirit of GDPR, which says user consent must be freely given and this interpretation of the rules could lead to future legal challenges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People will most definitely challenge Facebook,&quot; says Pat Walshe, chief at Privacy Matters. Will GDPR curtail the power of tech barons? Perhaps not, but by creating a clearer set of rules and forcing companies to be more open, the ordinary consumer can take back control.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ihave never read Fifty Shades of Grey. Not because I'm a prude; just that I'm more selective about my erotic literature and, with a rich imagination, less in need of it. I felt the need to clarify the point so my commentary on how a sexual spanking incident turned into a data protection dispute won't be interpreted as judgment. If Ms A enjoys a little discipline at the hands of Mr B, well, how thrilling to know someone is alive and having a good time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First, some context. By this day next week a lot of people will be worrying about the momentous events of Friday, May 25. You'll be enormously relieved to hear that I speak not of abortion. Next Friday is also the date on which an EU regulation, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), takes effect. It sets down strict rules on the personal information that companies are allowed to hold about their employees, customers and suppliers. You've probably noticed your inbox filling up with requests from companies to keep you on their mailing lists. Under GDPR they shouldn't contact you without your consent.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GDPR's principal effect, though, will be to make people aware of their existing rights and, just as importantly, their vulnerabilities. Consider the case of Robert Jones, a 40-year-old barrister. He worked for the legal firm Lexlaw in London and had spanked a female colleague over a senior partner's desk - as you do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The issue of consent is so fraught these days that we've heard people complain you would nearly have to sign a contract before having sex. Apparently, if I had read Fifty Shades of Grey, I would have known that in fact contracts are quite the thing between couples embarking on a little sexual sadism. That way they are both clear on how far things should go and how they might distinguish between a gratifying groan and a genuine expression of pain. As a barrister Jones would be even more aware of the necessity to put any agreements in writing. It all sounds very sensible to me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So Jones and the girl exchanged the necessary messages to confirm the parameters of their encounter. Sometime later he fell out with the firm - he claims over his salary. Alas, Lexlaw dug up the messages and claimed that he was suspended for the spanking. Jones is taking the company to an employment tribunal, accusing it of breaching data protection laws by accessing his personal messages. The case is to be heard in July.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm completely on Jones's side. Presumably Lexlaw will argue that if he used company platforms such as email or phones to exchange messages, then those are the property of the company, not the person. Jones, however, could claim that his personal messages are quite distinct from work communications. I think this is a case to which we should all play close attention, particularly since office-based sexploits are one of the few benefits of enduring an office in the first place. Even if we're not arranging a shag in the stationery cupboard, there is no harm to finding out if we have a right to privacy for personal or pervy communications with colleagues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Irrespective of the outcome, the mere existence of the case is yet another timely warning. In a world where men and women seem deeply confused about what constitutes a sexual assault and a sexual encounter, I sympathise with the impulse to make consent explicit. Anything you write down, though, will inevitably be read by someone other than the intended recipient. So spank away darling, but a verbal contract will have to suffice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Contracts are quite the thing when embarking on some sexual sadism</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BRITISH businesswoman Katie Henry reacted furiously to new General Data Protection Regulation calling on large and small companies to adopt stricter rules to protect customers' data that threatens a proportion of her income. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new European General Data Protection Regulation requires all businesses to protect and properly manage all customer privacy data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The European Union said it hoped to revolutionise the way public data is handled by big companies to promote better security and protection of customers' information.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Britain is set to implement the GDPR from the start of May as it will continue to be a member of the EU until Brexit becomes official in 2019.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But British business owner Katie Henry spoke out against the GDPR, saying that preparations to abide by the new privacy regulations are a &quot;waste of time&quot; and could cost her a proportion of her income.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Ms Henry said: &quot;I'm spending about an hour a day just looking at the ICO website, trying to interpret what they are saying and then going to all the relevant data that I and the other data managers hold though applications and software that I use to make sure they are GDPR compliant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ARTS IN OFFICES</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brexit news: Katie Henry said she is &quot;frustrated&quot; with the new European regulation                                            </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I suppose I'm spending more time than someone who works at a big organisation because it's just me. I'm quite confused about the situation and it's very frustrating.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Whereas I would rather be focusing on making sales and talking to my clients - the important things bringing in money - I feel like I'm essentially wasting my time writing a GDPR policy because it really shouldn't apply to me as such a small company.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Henry, who owns and manages an art supply company, added: &quot;For companies like mine, we rely on our database, we hold lots of information about our clients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The worry for us is that if we go to all of our clients and say we want to keep in touch lots of them are going to say 'actually no' and we lose half of our database and we lose the ability to generate income from those people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Any breach of data from a company will immediately incur fine of up to &pound;23.6 million or 4 per cent of the total worldwide annual turnover, whichever is higher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Britain is still a member of the European Union the GDPR will become enforceable in the UK on May 25 and Brexit is not expected to make any difference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dave Rogers, security product specialist at King of Servers, said that Britain backing the new law before Brexit makes it unlikely the legislation will change after withdrawal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Rogers told Express.co.uk: &quot;The UK Government has supported the legislation since it was initially read in the European Parliament, and it has already indicated that when the Brexit process is complete it will essentially, 'copy and paste' any EU law the UK is subject to into UK law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some commentators have suggested that perhaps when parliament is able to legislate without interference from Brussels, GDPR will be repealed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;However, we think this is quite unlikely. As it stands, the EU is one of the UK's biggest trading partners, and in order to continue doing business with countries inside the EU, the UK will need to ensure its own data protection laws match GDPR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Failure to do so may impact Britain's ability to do business with countries in the EU.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     St Jerome (1525-30) by Giovanni Girolamo Savoldo  There is an introspective evening quiet to the paintings of Savoldo that makes them arresting and absorbing. He worked in Venice in the age of Titian, and everything about this picture is exquisitely Venetian. It is painted in oil on canvas, which may not sound unusual but was still a new combination, pioneered in Venice - and a magical one. Oil paint with its capacity for many subtle layers has a particular affinity for the complex texture of canvas, as this painting beautifully demonstrates. That ethereal sky, those blue mountains, the warm flesh of St Jerome - Savoldo creates a quietly intoxicating array of poetic hues. What makes this painting especially ingenious is the cool shadowy foreground that contrasts with distant brightness. This negative light at the front of a scene goes against expectations and draws us into Jerome's meditations, to share his long dark night of the soul. &middot; National Gallery, London</SPAN></P>

Capturing fragments of street life in this still-exploding metropolis, his camera often hones in on the dispossessed, marginalised and incongruous bystanders of China's breakneck modernisation. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Royal Wedding won't be the only ostentatious display of privilege and wealth to be viewed with interest by the great unwashed on Saturday. The tens of thousands of flag-waving, cheering proles that line the streets to Windsor Castle in the hope of stealing a peek at the horse-drawn carriage procession transporting Harry and Meghan to their nuptials, will be matched later in the day by similarly curious hordes eager to rubberneck the FA Cup final between Manchester United and Chelsea in the FA Cup final at Wembley.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Quite which event turns out to be the most longwinded and tedious remains to be seen, although having clocked how Jos&eacute; Mourinho has set out his stall for most of Manchester United's other big games this season, The Fiver has a fair idea. But for all that, the fact that he and his opposite number, Antonio Conte, don't like each other very much ought to lend the occasion considerably more spice and needle than will be on show at Windsor Castle.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With United and Chelsea both going into the showdown on the back of disappointing seasons, there is an overwhelming sense that victory will be little more than a consolation prize; worth winning but nowhere near as prestigious as the kind of gaudy pots entitled fans of both footballing superpowers have come to expect. Asked if he thought there was any chance the match might be entertaining, Mourinho adopted the face of somebody who's just stepped in something soft and very unpleasant left on the pavement by a dog. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I still don't understand these words entertainment,&quot; he droned. &quot;You think 6-0 is entertaining? I don't think so. I think entertaining is emotion until the end; is open result until the end; is everybody on their seats until the end ... both dugouts nervous and tense with the unpredictability of the result. That for me as a football lover, that's entertaining so I think it's going to be entertaining.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fears that the final might not be all that appeared to be confirmed when Conte added his two cents. &quot;When you play a final the most important things is to win,&quot; he said. &quot;It will be a tactical game.&quot; Windsor or Wembley? Wembley or Windsor? Two big matches scheduled for Saturday, but which will be more attritional for viewers? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   QUOTE OF THE DAY                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was a pressure here, powerful, never going away. I was fine when I went into the dressing room for the France game but I started to feel this powerful dizziness, overwhelmed, panicked, and they lay me on the physio's bench. That was the first time but I had nasty episodes like that again. There's medicine, psychological treatment to overcome the barriers you've erected, the fear. It started in February and it lasted until the summer. When the Euros came I decided I couldn't go, that I had to isolate myself&quot; - Bojan Krkic speaks to Sid Lowe about how pressure has affected him.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Royal Mail chief executive Moya Greene went out on a high yesterday, with revenues passing &pound;10bn for the first time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having successfully floated what was a troubled business in 2013, she is bowing out after eight years.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Profits for the year to March tumbled 37 per cent to &pound;212m due to ongoing &quot;transformation costs&quot;, Royal Mail said, but the dividend was up 4 per cent to 24p. The shares are 12 per cent owned by staff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Greene can claim to have turned around a business badly in need of investment and settled with unions over pension reform.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was one last spat on her way out - a row over a &pound;6m &quot;golden hello&quot; to new chief executive Rico Back, who already runs the successful GLS European subsidiary. Mr Back, a non-dom who will live in Switzerland when he takes over, has built GLS up over the years with numerous deals. With Royal Mail poised to hand over &pound;100m to staff in pay rises, Ms Greene said the UK was the most competitive market for parcels delivery. She added: &quot;We have to stay number one in parcel Percentage Royal to &pound;212m year to delivery to manage the structural decline in letters. We need to reap more value from the tech investments that we have made. Consumers want to know every minute where their parcel is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Revenues rose 2 per cent to &pound;10.1bn. The shares, which have been rising sharply, fell 7.2 per cent to 555p ondrop in profits' for the March the FTSE 100 compared to a float price of 330p. Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown said: &quot;It's difficult to put your finger on exactly what's wrong with these results, there's just a series of small disappointments that mean they're not quite the full package.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Royal Mail also warned of another law change on the horizon that could impact on business. The incoming General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) changes may lead to a drop in marketing mail, according to Royal Mail. GDPR rules - designed to give people more control over their personal data - come into effect on 25 May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Greene steps down next month. EVENING STANDARD The number of letters sent in the UK continues to fall. Around 11.8 billion addressed letters are sent each year, down 4 per cent in 2016, according to Ofcom's latest figures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Percentage drop in Royal Mail profits' to &pound;212m for the year to March 37</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Royal Mail has warned that next week's major shake-up of personal data rules may hit UK mailings as business uncertainty also takes its toll. The group said it could see a steeper-than-expected drop in letter mailings ahead of the incoming General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) changes. The companynow expects the fall in letter volumes to be at the higher end of its 4 per cent to 6 per cent range, and could be more than 6 per cent at some stages over the year ahead, with ongoing business uncertainty adding to pressures. GDPR rules - designed to give people more control over their personal data - come into effect on 25 Mayand may lead to a drop in marketing mail, according to Royal Mail. PA</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Losses at Thomas Cook narrowed in the first half of the year but the travel giant flagged that the UK is still causing it a headache. The group posted a &pound;303m loss in the six months to 31 March, which compares to a &pound;314m loss in the same period last year. Revenue rose 5 per cent to &pound;3.2bn, driven by growth to Egypt and long-haul destinations. Thomas Cook boss Peter Fankhauser said that the firm continues to experience &quot;margin pressure&quot; in the UK, due to a combination of &quot;hotel cost inflation in Spain, currency impact and capacity increases in the market&quot;.

The group saw revenue drop nearly 15 per cent to &pound;24.5m in the period, with Foxtons bemoaning &quot;very challenging&quot; trading. Sales revenues dropped from &pound;11.1m to &pound;8.2m while lettings revenues came in at &pound;14.3m, down from &pound;15.5m in the same period last year. Mortgage revenue dipped from &pound;2.1m to &pound;2m.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RBS staff are not financially incentivised to move customers to digital banking, the chief executive of the bank has told MPs. Ross McEwan said the bank's employees were set &quot;goals&quot; to serve customers well, which include discussing banking options, but did not have targets to sign people up to online and mobile methods. He was responding to a letter from Westminster's Scottish Affairs Committee stating that press reports had &quot;cast doubt&quot; over his previous denials of the existence of such targets. RBS has been under pressure over its decision to axe 52 branches across Scotland. PA</SPAN></P>

Flight schools and airlines are moving to sponsor more courses, or cut the cost of training, amida global shortage of trained pilots.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She will go down in history as going&nbsp;against the majority in the EU referendum and as the killer of the Conservative Party if she insists on staying in the customs union and single market.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The EU, seemingly, believes that everything given by Britain will remain theirs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The clock is also ticking for Michel Barnier, the chief EU negotiator, as, if no deal is agreed, the EU will lose what it has so far gained in our concessions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SIR - It's time that the Prime Minister realised that high-quality fudge is already produced and exported from this country without her efforts to add to it by her senseless proposals about the customs union .</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SIR - Is this the country that lost countless dead to secure a free and democratic Europe in two world wars, that gave the world the industrial revolution, that led the world once in aviation, medicine and commerce?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whatever we were, since the Brexit referendum we have been shown up as an appeasing vassal state to the EU with a fifth column that won't accept democracy. British democracy is dead if we cannot swiftly enforce a referendum decision. No ifs, no buts.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Bercow | A controversial Speaker</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SIR&nbsp;- John Bercow's irascible persona renders all too credible the accusations of rudeness and bullying laid against him. All the more so when, as many of us noticed, these came from ex-employees of the Speaker's office who seemed both calm and dignified. It is shocking, therefore, to learn that MPs have blocked proper examination of the matter .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wherever the truth lies, the public are entitled to expect accusations against a person as elevated as the Speaker of the House of Commons to be fully investigated and certainly not brushed under the carpet, as they have been. Why should Mr Bercow be judged by different standards or treated differently from any other senior office holder?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SIR - The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority pays all MPs the same salary. Currently, this is &pound;77,379 for MPs, with a supplement of &pound;15,509 if they chair a committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MPs with additional responsibilities (such as government ministers, or the Speaker of the House of Commons) receive other entitlements as a result of those roles. These entitlements are administered by other bodies.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SIR - As a coordinator of two voluntary groups and a member of several others, I'd like to thank Ian Statham for his letter (May 18) about the new General Data Protection Regulation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I was told by someone who is employed to inform businesses about data protection matters that, under GDPR, I would need written permission to keep the names and addresses held for the groups on my computer. Having checked online at the Information Commissioner's Office website, as Mr Statham suggested, I now know that I don't have to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Janet Milliken Folkestone, Kent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is GDPR and will it affect you?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SIR - I am afraid Mr Statham is mistaken. While an organisation that processes data solely for recreational purposes may not need to register as a data controller and pay a fee, it will still need to comply with GDPR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is clear in the Information Commissioner's guidance.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SIR - The technical literature for Reynobond PE-core aluminium panels, installed on Grenfell Tower, states that they should not be used above 50 feet (five storeys). Reynobond FR (fire-resistant) panels have no such restriction and should have been used.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What more needs to be said? What regulations are not &quot;fit for purpose&quot;? What systems need a &quot;radical rethink&quot;. What &quot;ambiguities&quot; are there? Why is there talk of banning products? PE panels are suitable for the intended purpose: petrol stations, shop fronts, three-storey buildings etc.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SIR - I am not normally one to defend the Post Office or Royal Mail, but the staff at the newsagent to which Gerry Holman's postal services were moved ( Letters, May 15 ) should at least have advised him that in the absence of a form, the Keepsafe service (to hold on to mail while he was away) can be bought online or by a free telephone call.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On my first ward round as a newly qualified doctor in 1966, the sister told me she would be ashamed if a patient in her care were to develop parotitis, an infection of the parotid gland that can be caused by poor oral hygiene.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SIR - I fear Colin Graves, the chairman of the England and Wales Cricket Board, is deluding himself if he thinks the new Hundred tournament is the change that is needed to preserve the game's future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The magical attraction of cricket for youngsters starts at home with the encouragement and involvement of parents and grandparents, and continues at school with the opportunity to play the game in a more formal setting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to Test matches and the County Championship, the one-day game and T20 have both been introduced to attract a wider audience that likes to see a result on the day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rather than introduce a fifth format of the game, barely distinguishable from T20 and without any county allegiance for supporters, the ECB should be taking action to support and advance the game at state schools and at a junior club level.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SIR - I used to watch a lot of cricket, both live and on television. When it moved to subscription-only sports channels, it vanished from my life and has never been a part of the lives of my children, who are now in their early teens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Colin Graves can change the format all he likes, but if it is not on a television channel I have access to, I cannot watch and engage with it.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SIR - Forty years ago, on a beach in Devon, I saw several people using metal detectors to look for treasure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As I strolled across the sand I noticed a crumpled piece of paper which, on inspection, turned out to be a folded &pound;5 note. Its metal strip was not enough to alert the metal detectors. Sharp eyes worked.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                                        SQUAD GOALS                                      </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prince Harry's bride-to-be, Meghan Markle, wasn't the only public figure to front up on Thursday in a bid to explain to a curious English public why at least one key figure will be absent from an imminent event of major national and global significance. While she was telling us how much she cares for her father, who will not be present at her wedding, Gareth Southgate rocked up before the ladies and gentlemen of the fourth estate, to explain why Joe Hart, among others, will not be present at what promises to be an even bigger circus with far more comedy potential.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Along with Ryan Bertrand, Hart is one of just two England players to suffer the indignity of making the 18-man England squad for the 2018 Fifa [Ethics] World Cup Russia World Cup(TM) Panini sticker album, only to be unceremoniously dropped from the actual 23-man England squad ahead of the 2018 Fifa [Ethics] World Cup Russia World Cup(TM) tournament. Although it is far from the first indignity Hart has suffered in recent months, Southgate said the decision to leave him out was a tough one. &quot;Of course it was a difficult call,&quot; explained the England manager. &quot;But in the end I've got to look at performances over the last 18 months with their clubs, and the three lads we picked were the three best goalkeepers in the league this year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Southgate addressed the other high-profile absentees, including Jack Wilshere, he was also eager to sing the praises of those who will be given the opportunity to slink home from Kaliningrad in disgrace before the end of June. The baby of the group, Liverpool defender Trent Alexander-Arnold, was singled out for special praise on the back of Big Cup performances in which &quot;he's shown, in games of real pressure, the personality and the ability to cope with that&quot;. The Fiver can only hope the teenager copes as maturely when certain newspapers inevitably get on his case for such heinous misdemeanours as buying his mam a nice house, going out for breakfast or shopping for inexpensive clothes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As tends to be the case at such gatherings where the England football team is being discussed, the very important subject of who will wear a nylon piece of elastic on one sleeve and call &quot;heads&quot; or &quot;tails&quot; raised its weary head. An office famously likened by Big Paper's Royal Wedding correspondent Marina Hyde to that of a regimental goat, the identity of who will captain the football side remains a peculiarly English obsession. Southgate said he will &quot;think about that in a bit more detail&quot; when his avengers assemble before flying out to Russia. One suspects that whoever gets the gig will not have to lift anything heavier than team morale.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   QUOTE OF THE DAY                   </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Fiver, Fiver, Fiver ... have all those years of Tin robbed you of your sense of proportion? Describing Sam Allardyce's bespoke beverage-measuring device as Sam's boab led me to consider the possible variants to his usual pint of wine. Is a boab larger than a jeraboam? A Methuselah? What about the almighty Nebuchadnezzar? Sadly, apparently a boab is a tree, albeit a bottle tree. In the far reaches of Western Australia the boab trees, though not exceptionally high, appear huge. The name 'bottle tree' relates to the swollen trunk that can reach a massive girth of up to 20 metres. Maybe it's appropriate after all&quot; - Stephen Hodgson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Poor 2005's David Moyes (yesterday's Fiver). He only got himself a six-month contract, whereas tactically astute Sam Allardyce took an 18-month deal, when everyone knew they'd both be gone by now (except David, perhaps). I wonder whether Big Sam would top the league for managers making more from having contracts terminated than actually working them? Now there's a manager table someone at Fiver Towers can spend the weeks between now and 14 June working out in order to fill column space between the thrills of the pre-WC friendlies&quot; - Stephen King.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Looking at the picture posted in yesterday's Fiver in absence of letters, I couldn't help thinking that Manchester United club suits had found a subtle way of terminating Marouane Fellaini's new contract negotiations&quot; - Dave Gill.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When is a retirement not a retirement? When it's Gigi Buffon's. It transpires that Juventus' soon-to-be-ex-goalie might keep going after all. &quot;Until a few days ago it was certain that I would stop playing,&quot; he tooted. &quot;Now there are some interesting proposals.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Big Vase is back in the clutches of Atl&eacute;tico Madrid after their 3-0 win over Marseille. &quot;This [Big Vase] represents more than the [Big Vase] trophy,&quot; roared Diego Simeone. &quot;We reinvented ourselves in this competition.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given his efforts to sign every half-decent player who has ever existed, it must've been tricky for Ars&egrave;ne Wenger to pick his biggest transfer regret. &quot;[He] was here with [His] mother and we were very close,&quot; lamented Wenger. &quot;There is always something you could have done differently, but the problem of negotiations is to know when you give in and when you don't give in.&quot; Whoops. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thibaut Courtois has voiced some sensible and considered thoughts on the schedule demanded of elite footballers: &quot;If we play the World Cup final, we will have only two or three weeks of rest,&quot; he sighed. &quot;If you look at the NBA: eight months, 82 games. The guys who play the finals will play the final in June, but only begin again in October.&quot; The Fiver eagerly anticipates no one doing anything. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And plans have been put in place for a victory parade for Liverpool should they win Big Cup. &quot;Regardless of whether you are a Red, Blue or not a football fan at all, an event like this has a hugely positive impact,&quot; honked mayor Joe Anderson.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The FTSE 100 listed post and parcel delivery group's share price is down 5.79 per cent or 34.60p to 563.20p.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New data protection laws taking effect next week mean Royal Mail expects the number of letters being sent by Britons to dwindle even further.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group expects the number of addressed letters to fall nearer the higher end of its 4 to 6 per cent estimate this year.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New General Data Protection Regulation rules come into effect on 25 May and have been designed to give people more control over their personal data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the number of letters being sent expected to fall, Royal Mail is ploughing ahead with its quest to ramp up its parcel delivery business, which is seeing ever-increasing demand thanks to the rise in internet shopping.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Royal Mail said it has been 'working closely' with the industry and its customers ahead of the introduction of GDPR next week, which promises to be the EU's biggest personal data shake-up since 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In its latest set of annual results published today, Royal Mail posted a 37 per cent drop in pre-tax profits to &pound;212million, in part due to a pension charge hit.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Royal Mail closed its defined benefit pension scheme earlier this year following a lengthy dispute with trade unions.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A new 'Defined Benefit Cash Balance Scheme' was put in place from 1 April. Royal Mail expects the overall ongoing annual cash cost of pensions to come in at around &pound;400million.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On an underlying basis, Royal Mail's pre-tax profits rose 1 per cent to &pound;565million, while adjusted operating profits rose 1 per cent to &pound;694million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Revenues were 2 per cent higher at &pound;10.2billion and the group saw its best growth across its UKPIL arm for four years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moya Greene, Royal Mail's chief executive, who is stepping down from the top job next month, said: 'It has been another successful year, despite the challenging environment. Group revenue is now over &pound;10 billion, a significant milestone, thanks to our geographical diversification and focus on growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'GLS had another strong year. Its revenue grew organically and through targeted acquisitions in higher growth markets. Parcel volume growth in UKPIL was our best for four years. We delivered a resilient letters performance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We continue to focus on cost avoidance and parcel revenue growth in the UK and through GLS. The good cash generation characteristics of our business will support our progressive dividend policy.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Royal Mail's board is recommending a final dividend of 16.3p per ordinary share, bringing the total final dividend up 4 per cent on a year earlier to 24p per share.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The man due to take over as Royal Mail chief executive was handed nearly &pound;6million  to buy him out of his current contract with a subsidiary, it has emerged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rico Back, who is the boss of GLS, the Royal Mail's European arm, was paid to compensate him for payments he would have otherwise received.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was revealed as the successor to Moya Greene last month but at the time the company did not mention the payment, which was made last July.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SIR&nbsp;- If the EU and the British establishment succeed in keeping the United Kingdom inside, joined to, or governed by this anti-free trade, outdated and undemocratic institution, they are even more arrogant and, dare I say, stupid than many of us already suppose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A political campaign to extricate Britain fully from the EU will begin on the day following any such betrayal. It will be broader-based, better-funded and more determined than any previous domestic political movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The calm, free-spirited and unyielding determination of the British people, will, if required, eventually succeed in honouring this nation's decision to leave the EU fully.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Philip Duly                      Haslemere, Surrey</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brexit customs union</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SIR&nbsp; - By insisting that we stay tied to the customs union, Theresa May is acting as a fifth columnist for the Remain movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Leonard Macauley                      Staining, Lancashire</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SIR&nbsp;- We are now on the way to a total, humiliating capitulation to all the EU wants, in denial of the referendum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Hugh Ellwood                      Lytham St Annes, Lancashire</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SIR&nbsp;- Theresa May has broken her word. As a lifelong Tory I am appalled that this will hasten a Labour government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Dr Janet Voke                      Monks Risborough, Buckinghamshire</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seven kinds of Brexit</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SIR - I am the daughter of a Lithuanian refugee. I take pride in living in a democracy and have voted in every election since I was 21. I am 76 now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Mrs May lets the Brexiteers down I will not vote Conservative in the next election, or Labour. For the first time in my life I will not vote at all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Lesley Bull                      Petersfield, Hampshire</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SIR - Mrs May assures us we will be out of the customs union, but I believe she is incapable of taking hard decisions and that she unconsciously thinks she can keep on hedging until the matter somehow resolves itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even if it leads to a general election, there should be a leadership challenge. The outcome of an election cannot be worse than being shackled to the EU, and punished by it, indefinitely. At least the public will still be able to vote out any government it does not like.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs May's lack of leadership is a catalyst for monumental political change, and the Conservative Party is sleep-walking into the wilderness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Janet Payne                      Paphos, Cyprus</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SIR - Mrs May told us last year that no deal was better than a bad deal. Now her stance is that any deal, however bad, is better than no deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We should negotiate hard and stop submitting to EU diktats. Otherwise, there will be calls for Mrs May to be replaced, as we cannot believe what she says. The silent majority of Conservatives are becoming angry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Bill Filmer                      Lindfield, West Sussex</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SIR - In December, 2017 my husband purchased a voucher for afternoon tea for two at the Savoy Hotel in London. He paid &pound;136.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Imagine our surprise when, on finishing said afternoon tea, we were presented with a bill for &pound;18. This, we were informed, was a surcharge imposed for the whole of May because of the royal wedding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We think this is outrageous and would be interested to know what others think.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Marie Whitty                      Liverpool</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Royal wedding | Read more                   Dividing up maths                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SIR - Lord Baker has an interesting idea about maths examinations ( &quot;'Maths GCSE should be split in two' to boost numeracy&quot;, report, May 16 ).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When I took O-level maths in 1953, there were two designated subjects: elementary maths and additional maths. Perhaps they might be revived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     David Abell                      Portsmouth, Hampshire</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SIR - Lord Baker seems to have forgotten that it was he who combined CSEs with GCEs to create GCSEs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An additional maths O-level was also offered for the allegedly more able. I say allegedly because I managed to pass it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     David Nunn                      West Malling, Kent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   Recruiting GPs                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SIR&nbsp;- The difficulties of GP recruitment are complex ( Letters, May 16 ).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have long held the view that it starts with the selection process for medical school entry. The requirement of three Cs at A-level in the Sixties and early Seventies resulted in a much more diverse student population (although it was predominantly male).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Selection based purely on high academic achievement will perhaps attract undergraduates with different aspirations. Working hours are highly regulated and limited within the &quot;acute sector&quot;. Combine this with the diversity of career options within hospital medicine and you have the perfect storm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A portfolio career integrating elements of GP and hospital work may go some way to address this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Paul Lear FRCS                      Lydlinch, Dorset</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   The merits of naming a submarine Agincourt                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SIR - The Royal Navy's choice of the name Agincourt (report, May 15) for its new Astute-class submarine is most commendable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It acknowledges this country's proud military history and, more importantly, will annoy the French.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Hugh Neve                      Littlehampton, West Sussex</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SIR - There has been an Agincourt before, a battle-class destroyer of repute sent to the breakers' yard 40 years ago or more, but the name had not been used previously for a submarine. It had been hinted that HMS Agincourt was to be named HMS Ajax or HMS Achilles, but it seems that those famous names have fallen out of favour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     R H Clarke                      Portsmouth, Hampshire</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   Data panic                   What is GDPR and will it affect you?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SIR&nbsp;- I am intrigued that so many club secretaries are expending large amounts of time and resources to ensure their compliance with the new General Data Protection Regulations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Information Commissioner's Office provides a simple registration self-assessment tool online ( https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/register/self-assessment/ ), allowing organisations to determine whether they are affected by the GDPR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This says that those processing data to be used only in a recreational context are exempt from having to register. Thus, for such clubs, nothing will change when the regulations come in on May 25.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Ian Statham                      Cheltenham, Gloucestershire</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   Tooth care in hospital                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SIR - David Berry ( Letters, May 15 ), a dentist, describes visiting a patient in hospital and finding that no attention had been given to her teeth or dentures in three months of &quot;care&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1998, one of my dental patients remarked: &quot;Of course, you never get your teeth cleaned in hospital.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I couldn't believe this, and it prompted me to do some months' research into the oral healthcare instruction in nurses' basic training.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was none. I researched 31 textbooks that 162 nurse training establishments had told me they were using and, in the majority of them, advice on dental care was either very brief or completely absent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The British Dental Journal published my research paper in May 1998. Sadly, however, nothing appears to have changed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Dr Rosemary Longhurst                      Exmouth, Devon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   Fast asleep, fast                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SIR - I cured myself of dreadful insomnia ( Features, May 15 ) years ago by listening to audio books - as undemanding and childish as possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After a couple of minutes I was fast asleep. Martin Jarvis reading Just William was the best (sorry, Martin).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Maggie Hughes                      Gnosall, Staffordshire</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   Suddenly towards sunset the swallows arrived                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SIR - When we read Geoffrey Nute and Jim Montgomery's letters ( May 16 ) we were full of sympathy, as our swallows were also missing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, at 7.45 that evening, we saw the familiar flash of the swallows arriving. We can now settle down to enjoy their sky acrobatics and watch the hatchlings learn to fly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Jill Pye                      Fylde, Lancashire</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SIR - Sunday was a glorious day here in west Cornwall and the aeronautical displays of dozens of swallows stopped us on our walk in the hamlet of Brane. We were also treated to a musical performance by a lone cuckoo, which followed our tracks from Bartinney Downs to the village of Sancreed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Years ago a friend's husband so loved the swallows returning to nest in their eaves that he made them a Welcome home sign. That year they failed to materialise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps, like the weather, swallows are capricious and unpredictable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Maureen Sleeman                      Penzance, Cornwall</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SIR - At our local heritage railway, swallows used to build a nest above the light in the station house porch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year, however, they were thwarted by the railway's resident robin, who got in first. He did the same this year, pushing the summer visitors to their secondary residence inside the water tower. It seems the early bird gets not only the worm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Susan M Walton                      Gateshead</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SIR - Swallows returned here, as usual, on April 13. I worry about the steady reduction in suitable nest sites though.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Farm buildings all around this area are being sold off and turned into dwellings. For every barn converted, swallows are excluded.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SIR - Those youngsters who refer to people as &quot;gammon&quot; ( Comment, May 15 ) are referred to by me as &quot;spinach&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are green and, when it comes to it, boil down to almost nothing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Bruce Hyde                      Hoggeston, Buckinghamshire</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   Comparing notes                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SIR - Has anyone else found a &pound;5 note on the pavement? I found my second one yesterday, folded and forsaken in the breeze.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What should I do? Donate it to charity, perhaps?</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eurocrats in Brussels have never excelled at coming up with snappy names for their rules and regulations. Nor is the 88-page General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) EU 2016/679, which comes into force next Friday, likely to make riveting bedtime reading. Dry as it may sound, though, GDPR matters. That's because it involves the biggest shake-up to European Union data privacy rules in 20 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You may have seen its effects already, in a flood of recent emails clogging up your inbox, most of which urge you to keep on receiving mail from companies or organisations you may vaguely recall having dealt with years ago. But GDPR has far-reaching implications for business and consumers. By creating a set of &quot;digital rights&quot; for ordinary citizens, the new rules will hand Europeans much greater control over their online information and will affect all companies that do business with them. It will be quicker and easier, for example, for people to find out what information an organisation holds on them by requesting a copy of their personal data. In some circumstances, they can request that it be deleted.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Giovanni Butarelli, the European data protection supervisor, claimed in a recent blog post that GDPR &quot;aims to restore a sense of trust and control over what happens to our online lives&quot;. In fact, there's even more to it than that. Organisations that have suffered a cyberhack or a data security breach will be forced to report it to the authorities within 72 hours. That's a big change from the situation now, where it is merely considered &quot;good practice&quot; and many companies prefer to brush hacking incidents under the carpet. Moreover, unlike the existing patchwork quilt of legislation, the new rules have teeth. Companies found to have fallen short can be fined up to 4 per cent of their global turnover. The introduction of GDPR, while long in the pipeline, is also timely. It comes after a string of huge data breaches affecting hundreds of millions of people, the users of services such as Yahoo and Linkedin. The use of private data scraped from the profiles of 87 million Facebook users has shone a further spotlight on the risks posed by what is still a barely regulated data economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet the new rules, while tough, are not a cure-all, not least because GDPR is an EU-wide set of regulations being applied to a global industry dominated by American companies. Already, global technology giants are finding ways to sidestep the new regime, or at least minimise its impact. Last month, for example, Facebook made a subtle change to the way in which it treats hundreds of millions of users outside the United States and Canada. At the moment, Facebook members outside North America are governed by terms of service agreed with its international headquarters in Ireland; this month, Facebook is planning to make that the case for European users only, meaning that 1.5 billion members from Africa, Asia, Australia and Latin America will not fall under the EU's new rules.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The step removes a big potential liability for Facebook, but it also exposes the way GDPR may not have the sweeping impact its supporters may have hoped for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eventually, GDPR may become the basis for global standards on data privacy, but that's far from certain. In the meantime, Europe's regulators are pulling no punches in their portrayal of the risks posed by what Mr Butarelli describes as &quot;a broken and unbalanced ecosystem reliant on unscrupulous personal data collection and micro-targeting for whatever purposes promise to generate clicks and revenue. Let's hope that just like the dehumanising working conditions of the sweatshops of the 19th century, the abuses so prevalent in this early phase of digitisation are soon to be consigned to the history books.&quot; For many, that cannot happen soon enough.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Few people with online accounts can be unaware of the imminent arrival of GDPR, the General Data Protection Regulation. For weeks companies have been bombarding customers, asking for permission to continue sending and extracting the personal information they had previously agreed to share. The GDPR is the biggest shake-up in data privacy laws for 20 years, a period that has seen extraordinary advances in communications technology. To put it into context, in 1998 Google had only just been founded and Facebook did not exist.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GDPR is an EU measure, albeit one largely framed by UK officials, that seeks to bring the regulatory framework up to speed. Like many such measures, however, what started out with benign intentions has become a bureaucratic nightmare for companies, especially small and medium-sized enterprises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People are understandably worried about the risks to their data and tighter laws are needed to ensure it is not misused. The Data Protection Bill going through Parliament gives additional powers to the Information Commissioner to deal with data breaches. Yet this is the very Bill that was hijacked by peers and MPs to further their vendetta against the press rather than focus on the real abuses taking place in the communications sphere. People are still being scammed on an industrial scale and cold-calling remains rife despite umpteen promises to stop it. Yet the only time we have seen the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) in full dudgeon recently was when the now-defunct Cambridge Analytica was accused of helping the cause of Brexit and Donald Trump.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ICO is going to occupy an increasingly important role as the new data protection laws bed in; so it is vital that it avoids doing anything that smacks of responding to a political agenda. The hue and cry against Cambridge Analytica would never have happened had its customers been Barack Obama or Jeremy Corbyn. The law must be applied equally and without fear or favour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is also a danger of over-regulation. The new ICO powers include no-notice inspections, compelling organisations to hand over information and making it an offence to destroy, falsify or conceal evidence. Stopping criminals is one thing but the temptation to go for the easy target must be resisted and law-abiding businesses spared a heavy-handed approach.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under normal circumstances, the announcement of the England squad for Russia would be our lead story. But Tranmere have just been promoted back to the Football League, while Liverpool are in the final of Big Cup. So it's only fair that Evertonians should get the chance to trumpet some good news too. And they finally have some, as thousands gambol, cavort, frolic and prance all around Merseyside, to the tune of A Brand New Day from The Wiz, in celebration of Sam Allardyce's sacking. Now admittedly England only name a World Cup squad once every four years, while lately Everton have been binning managers at such a lick, they're in danger of making Mike Walker's stint look like the era of Harry Catterick. But folk at Goodison have been really suffering for the last five months, give them their moment will you. They deserve this.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, on Wednesday morning Big Sam was bundled out of the door marked Do One and sent bouncing down the road on the seat of his trousers. He came to a halt on the corner of Gwladys Street and Bullens Road, not far from the stadium's trade exit, which was just as well as he'd left something in his desk. &quot;You forgot this!&quot; screamed majority shareholder Farhad Moshiri, launching what appeared to be a large tin bucket down the street. As it deflected off Big Sam's noggin with a dull clank, it became clear in the bright morning sun of a glorious new epoch that it was in fact his personal silver jigger. Sam - whose 24-match interregnum gives Ronald Koeman that Thomas H McIntosh sheen - sighed, upturned the bespoke beverage-measuring device, and sat on it to sulk awhile in the style of Oor Wullie. Help Sam's boab!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sam was brought in at a challenging time last season to provide us with some stability and we are grateful to him for doing that,&quot; began a statement later issued by Everton's incoming chief suit, Professor Denise Barrett-Baxendale MBE, whose stately handle registers an impressive 8.7 on The Fiver's patented Sir Chips Keswick-o-meter. &quot;However, we have made the decision that, as part of our longer-term plan, we will be appointing a new manager this summer and will be commencing this process immediately.&quot; That process would appear to involve reclaiming the scrunched-up bit of paper from the waste bin with Marco Silva's name on it, and employing the man they wanted in the first place back in November, if only Watford hadn't gotten so shirty about it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So in absence of an interesting list of alternative candidates, let's conclude this story with a roll-call of something else : Butland (Stoke), Pickford (Everton), Pope (Burnley); Jones (Man Utd), Cahill (Chelsea), Walker (Man City), Trippier (Tottenham), Rose (Tottenham), Alexander-Arnold (Liverpool), Young (Man Utd), Stones (Man City), Maguire (Leicester); Dier (Tottenham), Henderson (Liverpool), Delph (Man City), Loftus-Cheek (Chelsea), Morris-Dancing Fiver (Fiver Towers), Lingard (Man Utd), Alli (Tottenham); Kane (Tottenham), Rashford (Man Utd), Vardy (Leicester), Sterling (Man City), Welbeck (Arsenal).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                                        CAN'T YOU FEEL A BRAND NEW DAY? (REPRISE)                                      </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cull of superannuated British managers continues apace : West Ham have decided against extending the contract of 2005's David Moyes. As breaking news goes, it's all a bit meh, given this outcome was pretty much expected back on 7 November, which was the day Moyes was given the job in the first place. Still, he kept them in the Premier League, which is an improvement on his performance at Sunderland. Sigh. It's a long time since he could be spotted, bronzed and gleaming, swanning down the stairs of the Hotel Maria Cristina, his palatial digs in San Sebasti&aacute;n, isn't it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anyway, unlike at Everton, a long list has been cobbled together in search of a successor. And here it is: Manuel Pellegrini, Rafa Ben&iacute;tez, Sean Dyche, David Wagner and Paulo Fonseca of Shakhtar Donetsk. Good luck, Gollivan! Good luck, everyone!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                                        RAY WILSON (1934-2018)                                      </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rampaging left-back Ray Wilson, one of England's World Cup winning heroes of 1966, has died at the age of 83. Wilson was the oldest member of the XI that played in the final at 32; it didn't stop him hoisting Bobby Moore on to his shoulder during the post-match celebrations, captured forever alongside Geoff Hurst and Martin Peters in a tableau that has come to define English football's greatest day. He won the FA Cup while at Everton, and enjoyed a lengthy spell with Huddersfield, remembered by fans of both clubs as one of their greats. RIP.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Hey there Field Left Blank. So listen, budski, my man, my main man... I know we've been sending you spammy emails about cheap holiday deals five days a week. For the last five years. Yeah, maybe we took a few liberties with that. Mistakes were made. IDK. But I'm here, today, to tell you we value you as a customer, Field Left Blank. So.... um, was wondering, would you be interested in maybe opting in? Please. Please?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So goes every third email in your inbox this week, as a change in the law heads towards its final 24 May deadline, with even such well-established email beggars as the Guardian getting in on the act. But what exactly is GDPR ?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is the EU's biggest personal data shake-up since 1995. And the US tech giants are not exempt, which is why Facebook quietly decided to move 70% of its global users' data back from its Irish headquarters to the US, outside the reach of GDPR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The regulation has been billed as a gamechanger in rebalancing consumer rights. The emails are the front door to that. Companies that have an &quot;existing relationship&quot; and valid consent with you might not need to reaffirm consent (there's a measure of grey here), but all those half-dormant relationships are about to get a massive spring clean. Click the opt-in button, or hear only silence, for ever. With opt-in rates apparently running at about 10%, many companies are resorting to prizes or draws to incentivise those consumer clicks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From 25 May, pre-ticked boxes can no longer be used to indicate consent to a company's terms and conditions. Plus, a request for consent cannot be buried under pages and pages of terms. You can request a copy of any personal information held, and you can ask a company to delete all the data they have on you.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The law also promises users &quot;data portability&quot;, which is designed to force operators to allow you to take your old data to the new company you prefer, preventing lock-in. If it works (many are sceptical), it could hugely boost competition, loosening the vast data monopolies of the big players. After a phase of hacks against everyone from LinkedIn to Ashley Madison, regulators have demanded &quot;pseudonymisation&quot; or &quot;tokenisation&quot; of user accounts. Meaning that even if user data leaks, it shouldn't be personally identifiable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It might be good for the consumer, but businesses are already grumbling about the cost of enforcement, with companies of more than 250 employees required to hire a data protection officer. That may prove to be money well spent. The maximum fine for non-compliance with the new rules is (EURO)20m (it was &pound;500,000 under the old system) or 4% of annual global turnover - whichever is bigger.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Closing summary  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thanks for joining us for our live coverage of Christopher Wylie's appearance before the Senate judiciary committee. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For close observers of the Cambridge Analytica story, there was little new information disclosed in this hearing. Since going public in the Observer in March, Wylie has spoken to numerous media outlets and testified to Parliament, so much of what he said today was familiar. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And while both Jamison and Hersh may have useful contributions to the debate about regulating social media and political advertisements, their presence at today's seemed largely designed to allow Republican interlocutors to talk about something other than Cambridge Analytica. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, Wylie is an effective communicator about the complexities of data and privacy, and his remarks on the difficulty of having true informed consent when it comes to internet platforms are important. It's also well worth keeping in mind that political scientists like Hersh are skeptical about claims being made about the efficacy of psychographic micro-targeting. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We'll have a full report on the day's proceedings from my colleague Olivia Solon shortly. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">block-time published-time 6.00pm BST </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tillis: We can talk about all the bad [social media platforms] have done, but I can also talk about the good they have done in crowdsourcing and preventing suicides. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">block-time published-time 5.58pm BST </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Klobuchar on the Facebook algorithm: The message I'm getting is that if you want to do a moderate, policy based post, you better pay to promote it. But if you do something really partisan, it will get a lot of engagement. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">block-time published-time 5.57pm BST </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Klobuchar is asking about the power of FB's algorithms to suppress or promote speech.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wylie: What you're talking about is distortion in the information that is available to people. Notes that distortion in other areas, like the financial markets, is regulated. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">block-time published-time 5.54pm BST </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Klobuchar: What do we know about the scope of Facebook's data problem? How many more Cambridge Analyticas are out there?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wylie: Only Facebook knows. He notes that Facebook threatened to sue the Guardian and banned him from the platform. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We don't require car companies to make unsafe cars and just put terms and conditions on the outside... We have rules that require safety and to put people first... In the 21st century it is nearly impossible for people to be functional without the use of the internet, so there should be some degree of accountability and oversight.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">block-time published-time 5.50pm BST </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wylie: I never directly communicated with Facebook about that project until I left the company. My understanding is that Aleksandr Kogan did communicate with Facebook. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blumenthal: In my questioning of Zuckerberg, I showed him the terms of service that showed Facebook was on notice of what Kogan was collecting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wylie: What I do know is that if you set up an app on FB, you have to submit the terms of service for review. So Facebook was notified, whether or not they bothered to read the terms and conditions, sort of like how many users don't read the ToS, is another matter. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Were Mercer's investments in Cambridge Analytica non-disclosed political donations?  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blumenthal: Did CA provide &quot;in kind&quot; services to US candidates?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wylie says not that he knows of, but that Mercer's investment in the firm made it possible for CA to charge less for services than it would have. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blumenthal is suggesting that this could be a non-disclosed campaign donation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wylie says this was an &quot;ancillary benefit&quot; of Mercer's investments, such that his money could support CA's clients without being reported as a donation. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wylie: The person you are referencing played a role in setting up the activity in Nigeria, which involved hacked material.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whitehouse says this was Black Cube, the Israeli firm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wylie: She made introductions between a group of Israelis and SCL. Wylie says Whitehouse needs to ask CA about whether this was Black Cube. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whitehouse: Is it true that CA had zero role in the Brexit referendum?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wylie: I don't agree with that because AIQ was set up to service Cambridge Analytica and SCL. &quot;AIQ was only set up to service SCL and Cambridge Analytica.&quot; To say that CA didn't have any role of infuence on Brexit is looking at it too narrowly. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">block-time published-time 5.40pm BST </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zuckerberg agrees to appear before European Parliament  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While we're waiting for the hearing to recommence... the president of the European parliament just announced that Mark Zuckerberg has agreed to appear at a closed-door meeting with MEPs in Brussels. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This decision is likely to only further anger the UK parliament, which has repeatedly called on the CEO to appear. MPs have gone so far as to threaten Zuckerberg with issuing a formal summons, so if Zuckerberg does travel to Brussels next week, we imagine he won't be flying through Heathrow. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">block-time published-time 5.19pm BST </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We're taking a quick recess so the senators can vote on something. But referring back to Kennedy's point on censorship: Facebook can and does censor what you see on the platform. Some of this censorship occurs automatically, through algorithms that promote certain posts while hiding others, depending on the various signals that Facebook uses to rank News Feed posts. Other censorship is based on the content of posts, and Facebook has only recently begun to be more transparent about how it determines what content is and is not allowed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">block-time published-time 5.17pm BST </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hersh: We have a basic human response that we are attracted to provocation and extremism, and what the platforms are doing is promoting that attraction. It's about what we want. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">block-time published-time 5.16pm BST </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kennedy: &quot;Here's the problem, we can all agree that poison is being spread on social media. Here's the tough part: define poison. I don't want Facebook censoring what I see.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">block-time published-time 5.14pm BST </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We're returning to Senator Kennedy, who already asked questions earlier. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kennedy: Did the Facebook co-founder share data with the Obama campaign that it didn't share with the Romney campaign because he wanted Obama to win?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jamison explains that this is not true. Chris Hughes was working for the Obama campaign. But he understood how Facebook worked and was able to teach the Obama campaign how to use it. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">block-time published-time 5.12pm BST </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Booker: It was stunning to me that big data was used not to rally voters but to suppress voters? Was this a determined effort to suppress votes not just of African Americans or other groups?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wylie: My understanding was that it was to suppress any group of voters that would go for Democracts, especially African Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">block-time published-time 5.11pm BST </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Booker: Was this about inflaming differences?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wylie: The US went through a civil rights movement in an attempt to desegregate society. What we're seeing now is a resegregation of society by algorithms. Some people call that echo chambers. CA was looking to exploit certain vulnerabilites in certain segments to send them information that will remove them from the public forum, and feed them conspiracies and they'll never see mainstream media... We have destroyed the public forum. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wylie describes videos created by CA as &quot;sadistic and Islamophobic&quot;. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senator Mazie Hirono, Democrat from Hawaii, addresses Hersh. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hirono: If we were to consider regulating anything, should we focus on regulating ads or messages that demobilize people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hersh: I've worked for the ACLU on government voter suppression, but this is different. What's the line for demobilization by a campaign? What if a campaign is just describing a candidate's shortcomings? Is that demobilization?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hirono: We're talking about people paying to suppress votes? That's different from someone just saying don't vote for so-and-so. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hirono seems to be suggesting that ads aimed at voter suppression could be regulated, but that seems highly questionable from a First Amendment point of view. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wylie: When you poll a random sample of African Americans, they're not the same people. Different lives, different characteristics. So you don't treat them just as a black person, you treat them as who they are. That can be used to motivate them to vote or not to vote. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wylie: Racial characteristics can be modeled. We were able to get an AUC score that was 0.89. It's a way of measuring precision, which means it's very high.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wylie: After I inquired about the relatively convoluted set up of CA, what was explained to me was that when you invest money as an investor into a company that you own, it doesn't necessarily constitute an election donation which is declarable.</SPAN></P>

In terms of the dangers, data is powerful and if it's put into the wrong hands it becomes a weapon.

When someone &quot;consents&quot; to something online, if that's the only way you can get a job it's not really a fair situation.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">block-time published-time 3.27pm BST </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hersh is casting doubt on whether Cambridge Analytica's psychographic targeting claims. He says campaigns that attempt to predict race of voters are wrong 25% of the time.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hersh: &quot;Every election brings exaggerated claims about the technological feats of campaigns.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hersh points out that this occurs both because new technology is an easy story for the media, and because political consulting firms need to market their wares. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The contrast between Grassley and Feinstein's perspectives on this hearing is stark. Grassley basically said, everyone uses data and microtargeting, but sure, let's talk about it in general. Feinstein is asking questions about the shadiest aspects of CA's activities, digging into possible connections to Russia, WikiLeaks, and hackers. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Grassley was going big picture, Feinstein is digging into the details of Cambridge Analytica's dealings, giving a description of Project Ripon - the campaigning interface the company built - and how they used psychographic profiles to segment voters and craft messages. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Grassley is bringing up other uses of microtargeting and Facebook data, such as the Obama campaign's use of a Facebook app in 2012. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">block-time published-time 3.08pm BST </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Grassley: The underlying facts of what happened with CA and the Facebook data haven't changed much since December 2015, when the Guardian first reported on the data's use by the Ted Cruz campaign. What's changed is that CA went to work for Trump, and Trump won. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Grassley says that he requested Cambridge Analytica to appear at this hearing, but they declined in light of their recent declaration of insolvency. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">block-time published-time 2.58pm BST </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eitan Hersh, the political scientist and expert on microtargeting who is also testifying at today's hearing, just released his written testimony. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The testimony is eight pages long, but here's the introduction (emphasis mine): </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First, I will describe voter targeting practices. Based on the information I have seen from public reports about Cambridge Analytica, it is my opinion that its targeting practices in 2016 ought not to be a major cause for concern in terms of unduly influencing the election outcome. Second, I will explain the gaps in our knowledge about the effects of social media-based targeting. Much more could be learned by impartial researchers to determine the power of targeting tools used in the 2016 election and, more importantly, the landscape of targeting in the coming years. In order for researchers to learn these things, they will need access to data held by Facebook. Third, I will suggest that those interested in the effect of social media platforms on electoral politics should focus not only on the supply of provocative political information from campaigns and firms like Cambridge Analytica, but also on the demand for provocative information from American citizens. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senators are filing into the hearing, and the witnesses are seated, so we should be getting started soon. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">block-time published-time 2.49pm BST </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Report: FBI and DOJ investigating Cambridge Analytica  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last night, the New York Times reported that the department of justice and FBI have begun investigating the now-defunct Cambridge Analytica. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the Times, investigators have been questioning former CA employees, as well as its banks. Wylie confirmed to the Times that he had been contacted by both the FBI and the DOJ, and was planning to meet with their investigators. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The political consultancy is also facing investigations in the UK. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">block-time published-time 2.24pm BST </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Opening summary  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Welcome to the Guardian's live coverage of Christopher Wylie's appearance before the Senate judiciary committee. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wylie is the pink-haired Canadian data scientist whose decision to blow the whistle on the use of Facebook data by Cambridge Analytica set off shock waves that are still reverberating through Westminster, Washington DC, and Silicon Valley. Since Wylie went public with the story of how the personal information of tens of millions of people was harvested from Facebook and used by a political consultant for Donald Trump, Cambridge Analytica has collapsed and Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg was hauled in front of Congress for the first time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wylie appeared before the digital, culture, media and sport select committee of Parliament in late March, and he met privately with House Democrats in April. Today's hearing, titled &quot;Cambridge Analytica and the Future of Data Privacy&quot;, will be his first public appearance before US lawmakers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also testifying are Eitan Hersh, a professor of political science and author of Hacking the Electorate, and Mark Jamison, a visiting scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and director of the University of Florida's Public Utility Research Center. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jamison has written about the fallout from the Cambridge Analytica scandal from a business perspective, noting that while the use of data for political campaigns is normal, Facebook was wrong not to be more transparent with its users: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For markets to perform well, customers should be given complete and understandable information on the nature of the services they are buying, even those that have a zero monetary price as in the case of Facebook. This isn't happening. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hersh, whose book studies the use and efficacy of micro-targeting by political campaigns, has called Cambridge Analytica's claims about psychographic profiling &quot; snake oil &quot;. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To me, the story is 99% about Facebook and 1% about Cambridge Analytica,&quot; Hersh told the LA Times. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">TECHNOLOGY; Version:1</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">813 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook allows advertisers to target users it thinks are interested in subjects such as homosexuality, Islam or liberalism, despite religion, sexuality and political beliefs explicitly being marked out as sensitive information under new data protection laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The social network gathers information about users based on their actions on Facebook and on the wider web, and uses that data to predict on their interests. These can be mundane - football, Manhattan or dogs, for instance - or more esoteric.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Guardian investigation in conjunction with the Danish Broadcasting Corporation found that Facebook is able to infer extremely personal information about users, which it allows advertisers to use for targeting purposes. Among the interests found in users' profiles were communism, social democrats, Hinduism and Christianity.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The EU's general data protection regulation (GDPR), which comes into effect on 25 May, explicitly labels such categories of information as so sensitive, with such a risk of human rights breaches, that it mandates special conditions around how they can be collected and processed. Among those categories are information about a person's race, ethnic origin, politics, religion, sex life and sexual orientation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The information commissioner's office says: &quot;This type of data could create more significant risks to a person's fundamental rights and freedoms, for example, by putting them at risk of unlawful discrimination.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Organisations must cite one of 10 special dispensations to process such information, such as &quot;preventive or occupational medicine&quot;, &quot;to protect the vital interests of the data subject&quot;, or &quot;the data subject has given explicit consent to the processing of those personal data for one or more specified purposes&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook already applies those special categories elsewhere on the site. As part of its GDPR-focused updates, the company asked every user to confirm whether or not &quot;political, religious, and relationship information&quot; they had entered on the site should continue to be stored or displayed. But while it offered those controls for information that users had explicitly given it, it gathered no such consent for information it had inferred about users. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The data means an advertiser can target messages at, for instance, people in the UK who are interested in homosexuality and Hinduism - about 68,000 people, according to the company's advertising tools.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook does demonstrate some understanding that the information is sensitive and prone to misuse. The company provides advertisers with the ability to exclude users based on their interests, but not for sensitive interests. An advertiser can advertise to people interested in Islam, for instance, but cannot advertise to everyone except those interested in Islam.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company requires advertisers to agree to a set of policies that, among other things, bar them from &quot;using targeting options to discriminate against, harass, provoke or disparage users, or to engage in predatory advertising practices.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement, Facebook said classifying a user's interests was not the same as classifying their personal traits. &quot;Like other internet companies, Facebook shows ads based on topics we think people might be interested in, but without using sensitive personal data. This means that someone could have an ad interest listed as gay pride because they have liked a Pride-associated page or clicked a Pride ad, but it does not reflect any personal characteristics such as gender or sexuality.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company also said it provided some controls to users on its ad preferences screen. &quot;People are able to manage their ad preferences tool, which clearly explains how advertising works on Facebook and provides a way to tell us if you want to see ads based on specific interests or not. When interests are removed, we show people the list of removed interests so that they have a record they can access, but these interests are no longer used for ads.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It added: &quot;Our advertising complies with relevant EU law and, like other companies, we are preparing for the GDPR to ensure we are compliant when it comes into force.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The findings are reminiscent of Facebook's previous attempts to skirt the line between profiling users and profiling their interests. In 2016 it was revealed that the company had created a tool for &quot;racial affinity targeting&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the time, Facebook repeatedly argued that the tool &quot;is based on affinity, not ethnicity&quot;. Discussing a person who was in the African American affinity group, for instance, the company said: &quot;They like African American content. But we cannot and do not say to advertisers that they are ethnically black.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Almost a year later, after it was revealed that advertisers could use the ethnic affinity tools to unlawfully discriminate against black Facebook users in housing adverts, Facebook agreed to limit how those tools could be used.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Few people with online accounts can be unaware of the imminent arrival of GDPR, the General Data Protection Regulation. For weeks companies have been bombarding customers, asking for permission to continue sending and extracting the personal information they had previously agreed to share. The GDPR is the biggest shake-up in data privacy laws for 20 years, a period that has seen extraordinary advances in communications technology. To put it into context, in 1998 Google had only just been founded and Facebook did not exist.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GDPR is an EU measure, albeit one largely framed by UK officials, that seeks to bring the regulatory framework up to speed. Like many such measures, however, what started out with benign intentions has become a bureaucratic nightmare for companies, especially small and medium-sized enterprises .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a glance | Your data rights</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People are understandably worried about the risks to their data and tighter laws are needed to ensure it is not misused. The Data Protection Bill going through Parliament gives additional powers to the Information Commissioner to deal with data breaches. Yet this is the very Bill that was hijacked by peers and MPs to further their vendetta against the press rather than focus on the real abuses taking place in the communications sphere. People are still being scammed on an industrial scale and cold-calling remains rife despite umpteen promises to stop it. Yet the only time we have seen the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) in full dudgeon recently was when the now-defunct Cambridge Analytica was accused of helping the cause of Brexit and Donald Trump.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ICO is going to occupy an increasingly important role as the new data protection laws bed in; so it is vital that it avoids doing anything that smacks of responding to a political agenda. The hue and cry against Cambridge Analytica would never have happened had its customers been Barack Obama or Jeremy Corbyn. The law must be applied equally and without fear or favour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is also a danger of over-regulation. The new ICO powers include no-notice inspections, compelling organisations to hand over information and making it an offence to destroy, falsify or conceal evidence. Stopping criminals is one thing but the temptation to go for the easy target must be resisted and law-abiding businesses spared a heavy-handed approach.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">INCOMING European data protection laws may lead to an upsurge of cyber attacks as criminals try to exploit the communications between businesses and customers regarding updated privacy policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Britons may have noticed a recent increase in emails sent from restaurants, media companies or retailers which have stored their data in the past, a trend spurred by the General Data Protection Regulation landing on May 25.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Extortionists are already using spoof email templates to lure people into inadvertently sharing their personal or financial information, cyber security experts have warned. In one instance, a fake GDPR email claiming to be from Airbnb attempted to trick users into clicking on a link that would have asked them to input credit card information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Redscan cyber security director Mark Nicholls said: &quot;Reported phishing attacks on customers of Airbnb is just the tip of the iceberg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No doubt hackers will be repeating the approach with other brands, doing so right up until the GDPR implementation and probably beyond. The window of opportunity for social engineering attempts is often short and criminals are unlikely to pass up the opportunity to trick unsuspecting account holders.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Shier from Sophos said: &quot;With potentially so many unsolicited, but legitimate, emails arriving into users' inboxes there's bound to be some desensitisation that occurs and therefore would make it easier for criminals to slip through unnoticed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook and Google have been among the tech giants making changes and announcements ahead of GDPR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Facebook, this will relate to the kind of data it collects, as well as its use of facial recognition. Facebook has said that GDPR could negatively impact user growth, as it is requiring users to accept its new terms to keep using its full service. Many small businesses now feel that GDPR could strengthen the hands of large tech companies, all at their expense. There are fears that getting user data permission may put people off small businesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While companies such as Google and Facebook are more likely to be trusted, small companies that rely on user data for marketing may not get permission to hold that information.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">STRUGGLING Snap will use the incoming data protection crackdown to challenge Facebook, in the wake of a series of privacy scandals that has engulfed the social network.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The parent company to popular photo-sharing app Snapchat announced greater data controls for users yesterday ahead of the Europe-wide General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which will offer consumers greater privacy when it comes into force on May 25.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It issued a warning to social media rivals, many of which have capitalised on the lack of data regulation surrounding technology companies. Katherine Tassi, former Facebook and Uber privacy boss, told The Daily Telegraph that Snapchat had previously had to &quot;work harder&quot; to generate advertising revenue thanks to its refusal to target its users &quot;to a level that makes people feel uncomfortable&quot;, like rival Facebook.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We approach advertising product from a different perspective and we have always had to be more creative to build personalised and relevant advertisement,&quot; Ms Tassi said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We think that is our differentiator and that it will pay off. GDPR is levelling the playing field.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Snapchat's popularity among young people made it hot property upon its 2016 New York stock exchange debut, but in the past three months has seen shares slide 50pc as the company struggles to engage users and prove its profitability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The unpopular app redesign in early 2018, which caused user growth to drop off, coupled with 2017's $40m (&pound;28m) writedown of unsold Spectacles stock has led analysts to downgrade its potential.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Comparatively, Facebook's value remains intact despite the recent Cambridge Analytica data scandal. Snap and Facebook have been pitted against each other since Mark Zuckerberg bought Instagram, a direct rival to Snapchat, in 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following the purchase, Instagram launched a feature called &quot;Stories&quot;, which shared the same function as Snapchat's tool of the exact same name. Stories was later added to Facebook.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Snap's long-held focus on privacy could result in it outshining big players such as Facebook, Instagram and Twitter now that they have been forced to curb their data collection - or face fines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If found in breach of the law, Facebook faces a maximum fine of $1.1bn. Growth may take a hit as the enforced transparency tools allow users to see how much information is collected on them and could lead them to permanently log out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Snapchat said that achieving compliance ahead of the GDPR &quot;wasn't a challenge&quot; and that &quot;data minimisation was already part of our privacy-by-design ethos&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It will increase the amount of information that users can download so they can see exactly how their information is being used and what it is being stored for in its privacy settings over the coming weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Companies found to be in breach of the GDPR face a maximum penalty of 4pc of global annual turnover or (EURO)20m (&pound;17.6m) depending on which is greater.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Fiver always was dubious that Gareth Southgate would take Joe Hart to the Ethics World Cup because of his tournament experience. Admittedly it didn't seem too outlandish when people suggested he should be included in the England squad in a Pepe Reina-esque cheerleader role, there to keep spirits in the camp high with his b@ntz and sagely advise Jack Butland and Jordan Pickford on how best to scream at unsuspecting Russian ball boys. For a while it seemed Southgate was going to bring him along for the ride. Until, that is, England's manager discovered that the person leading the clamour for the Manchester City goalkeeper was none other than Shortbread McFiver, our Scottish cousin. Sneaky Shortbread McFiver! Bad Shortbread McFiver! </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch Fiver, our Welsh cousin, was also in on it and for some unknown reason their underhand campaign was garnering plenty of support in Belgium, Panama and Tunisia. Funny, that. But luckily Southgate cottoned on to their devilish ruse, at which point his mind was made up. Hart, who spent most of the season either on West Ham's bench or chucking the ball into his own net, would not be going to Russia. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 31-year-old received the bad news on Monday and the worst thing, perhaps, is that nobody was that surprised when the media spilled the beans on Tuesday. There was no uproar about uncapped Nick Pope being chosen instead, no controversy, no immediate cry for Southgate to apologise to Meghan and Harry for overshadowing their big day. Instead everyone shrugged and wondered where it all went wrong for Po' Joe, who was once so promising and talented and free of dandruff. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since you ask, The Fiver reckons it was when he started gurning at Andrea Pirlo at Euro 2012, which is the kind of wisdom Pickford and Butland will have to live without this summer. Plus he probably should have thought twice before moving to West Ham on loan given that playing behind one of the Premier League's worst defences didn't exactly do wonders for his fragile confidence. Mind you, it did give him a chance to get to know Andy Carroll better. At least those two can get on with booking their summer holiday to Vegas now. Southgate, meanwhile, is only thinking about Russia. Having submitted his provisional 35-man squad, all he needs now is a new No 1. It's between Butland, who's just been relegated with Stoke, or Pickford, who chucked a couple in against West Ham on Sunday. What could possibly go wrong? Shortbread McFiver can't wait to find out.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Your disgust at the 'unprecedented scenes at Huddersfield' where you allege 'almost every single person present seemed deliriously happy' (yesterday's Fiver) put me in mind of Nick Hornby's explanation in Fever Pitch of why he fell for one of the clubs involved in this disgraceful spectacle. 'What impressed me most was just how much most of the men around me hated, really hated, being there. As far as I could tell, nobody seemed to enjoy, in the way that I understood the word, anything that happened during the entire afternoon,' he wrote of his first visit to the Library. Who am I to doubt Hornby? By making them unhappy, Ars&egrave;ne Wenger gave Arsenal fans what they truly want. His successor needs to return the club to its miserable roots and wipe the unnatural smiles off their faces&quot; - Peter Berlin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'd like to laud the achievements of Phil Brown (yesterday's Fiver letters). Getting a pay-off from Southend, wangling a gig at Swindon and then bumping up his contract so that if they tell him to 'do one' next season he gets another pay-off? Pure genius. Have to wonder if that's what Antonio Conte was trying this year?&quot; - Paul Dixon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Re: Paul Benveniste's missive about the local horse-buying scamp who could provide a lesson for Stoke's management team (yesterday's letters). Given that they already shelled out substantial sums for several donkeys, surely they don't need further 'inspiration', merely more stalls in the Britannia stables&quot; - Derek McGee.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The last time an incumbent captain of India joined an English county side was in 2000, when Sourav Ganguly pitched up at Lancashire. The story goes that early on, such was their overseas signing's attitude that he handed his batting partner, one Mike Atherton, his sweater during a break in play with orders to run it back to the dressing room.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a great line but, sadly, one that is apocryphal, or has at least been spun to such an extent that Muttiah Muralitharan would have been be proud. Atherton did briefly find himself holding said cable-knit while his team-mate made a sartorial adjustment but apparently no such instruction was given.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevertheless, that such an embellishment followed is still symptomatic of Ganguly's time at Old Trafford as a man apart. Andrew Flintoff said it was like having &quot;Prince Charles&quot; in the team, such was his regal demeanour. Ian Austin lamented the fact he &quot;made no attempt to join in socially&quot; and did not truly deliver with the bat after turning up believing &quot;county cricket would be a doddle&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others simply described a cricketer who was a little reserved - hardly a first - and worked his hours. Ganguly himself has since explained that long playing days meant drinking after stumps was not his thing, not least since his wife, Dona, was with him in Manchester and did not know many people. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ganguly-Lancashire mismatch came to mind when The Spin began pondering the impending arrival of Virat Kohli at Surrey for his mutually beneficial month-long spell in June. The India captain, desperate to avoid a repeat of a 2014 horror show that yielded 138 runs in 10 innings against England, can adjust to conditions before the Tests in August, while the club and the County Championship will be swamped by an avalanche of stardust.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beyond the inevitable grumbles about English cricket pointing the blunderbuss to the foot of its own national team, what can his new team-mates expect from Kohli? Will he be rocking up and throwing his bats to Rikki Clarke for extra linseed oil, or ordering Sam Curran to fetch him 1,000 brown M&amp;Ms to fill a brandy glass as a pre-condition of taking the field? After all, this is a cricketer with a combined social-media following of 83 million people, estimated annual earnings of &pound;20m (thanks to deals with Puma, Tissot, Audi and Pepsi) and is one half of India's leading power couple following his marriage to Bollywood's Anuskha Sharma. Surrey have long had a reputation as the south London strutters who love a big-name signing, but Kohli surely tops the lot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To this end, The Spin enquired as to what is in store for the dressing room in SE11 by asking Moeen Ali and Chris Woakes, two upstanding Brummies who have spent the past six weeks playing under Kohli for Royal Challengers Bangalore in the Indian Premier League, for something of a character reference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know a few of the Surrey guys and they are not what people make them out to be a lot of the time. But if anyone in that dressing room does think they are a big dog, they will need to sit down for a little while because there is a proper big dog coming,&quot; says Moeen with tongue is slightly in cheek.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You have your perceptions of someone like Virat, who is quite passionate, emotional, in your face and plays it hard,&quot; explains Woakes. &quot;But off the field he's very calm and you can chat about anything. He's very down to earth and for someone who has such huge pressures and public focus in India, to see him go about his business in this way quite refreshing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moeen adds: &quot;You see him on the field and people might think he's arrogant but it is the complete opposite. He's so humble it is almost weird how nice he is. He's the biggest name in India but will ring me to check I'm OK or ask if I fancy lunch. Sometimes a player will invite the squad to their house for a meal and it would be easy for him to say no. But he would always go. I can say with certainty that anyone who has a bad word doesn't know the guy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though Kohli's presence in county cricket will doubtless draw huge focus - no bad thing at a time when the English game is finally trying to break down barriers to entry for the South Asian community - it will still be a step down in intensity from the hothouse of India. Indeed AB de Villiers, another RCB team-mate, told The Spin he expects the 29-year-old to one day finish his career in England for this reason.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Says Woakes: &quot;In my first year of IPL I found as an overseas player you get a lot of attention walking through airports in India. But having him in the team - the No 1, the king - we're almost irrelevant. It makes you realise what his life is like. So county cricket will be much more chilled and he'll enjoy that. Playing at smaller grounds, that will be an experience too. Having spoken to him about it, he loves touring other countries - it's a release.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Surrey confirmed the deal, director of cricket Alec Stewart said one of the main benefits will be watching his off-field preparation - not least his dedication to fitness - with Woakes giving a glimpse of just what this means.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Around 30 minutes before the bus leaves for a match, he does what he calls a 'priming session' in the gym,&quot; he says. &quot;It's like a short burst of Olympic weightlifting. It's certainly different but it works for him. Overall, his fitness work is having a serious impact on the next generation of Indian players. He's leaner, fitter, more agile than those before.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Moeen, however, Kohli's overriding impact on Surrey will probably be his drive: &quot;When he crosses the line he just wants to win. But it's winning with control, not win at all costs. They will see his passion for the game. It is unbelievable. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the fact he's coming in a day and age when people are trying to play as much T20 as they can, that sums him up - he's just dedicated to improvement. The England series is big for him personally and he's giving himself the best chance to succeed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latter point may leave some frustrated and the fact it means missing Afghanistan's inaugural Test in India will irk others. But there is little question that county cricket is going to get an almighty jolt when Kohli arrives next month, not least to any &quot;big dogs&quot; in south London.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook has introduced a whole heap of new privacy settings as the GDPR law is set to take force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But one of the most useful tools has actually been around for ages - and it's a simple switch that means you're not disturbed by other friends who can see you're online.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All it takes is switching off the chat box on the right hand side of your dashboard to have your incoming chats redirected to your inbox as messages.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once you've logged intoFacebook, find the gear menu button at the bottom right corner of your screen and click it. Then select that Turn Off Chat option and you'll see the entire box is suddenly greyed out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You'll now be able to see who else is online, but they'll have no idea that you're available to be pestered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Where it can get a bit tricky is if you're using the standalone Facebook Messenger app at the same time. Switching off chat in Facebook's main (desktop) mode doesn't take away your visibility on Messenger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Mark Weinstein: Why you shouldn't let YOUR children use Facebook's new 'Messenger Kids' chat app                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you want to appear offline on Facebook Messenger, these are the steps you need to follow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's also a way to appear offline to just specific friends. Basically, you have to block them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In order to block a contact on Facebook Messenger, you need to find them in your address book and tap on their name to open up a new conversation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tap their name at the top of the chat window and you'll be offered the option to either ignore messages or block them outright. Choose the latter if you want them never to know if you're online or not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Don't worry, you can always unblock a contact at a later date if you decide you want them to know your online availability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just a side note here - if you're using Facebook on your desktop, you can also selectively toggle who sees whether you're online or not. As well as turning off chat completely, you can turn off chat for only some people - just enter their name in the dialogue box that appears.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The&quot;snooze&quot; buttonallows you to temporarily unfollow a person, page or group, meaning you won't see any of their posts for 30 days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They won't be notified of the change, and the setting can be reversed at any time.Facebookwill also notify you when the snooze period is about to end.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Seeing too many photos of your uncle's new cat? Is your friend tempting you with endless photos of ramen on her Japan trip?&quot; said Shruthi Muraleedharan, product manager at Facebook.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;With Snooze, you don't have to unfollow or unfriend permanently, rather just stop seeing someone's posts for a short period of time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To &quot;snooze&quot; a friend on Facebook, all you have to do is click on the menu icon in the top-right corner of a post, and select &quot;snooze&quot; from the drop-down menu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you're looking for a more permanent solution, you can also unfollow friends, or hide or report individual posts in this way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     One in six of us spend two hours in bed every day doing this - when we should be sleeping                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You might not realise it but you can actually have Facebook Messenger without needing a fully-fledged account. Instead, you can run it off your phone's contacts and just use it as a standaone messaging app.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thesocial networkdoesn't even require an email address. Instead, users must submit their first and last names as well as a phone number and a photo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;With this update, more people can enjoy all the features that are available on Messenger - including photos, videos, group chats, voice and video calling, stickers and more. All you need is a phone number,&quot; the company said in 2015 when it first made the change.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Struggling Snap will use the incoming data protection crackdown to challenge Facebook, following a series of privacy scandals that has engulfed the social network.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The parent company to popular photo-sharing app Snapchat today announced greater data controls for users ahead of the European-wide General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which will offer consumers greater privacy when it comes into force on May 25.&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It issued a warning to social media rivals, many of which have capitalised on the lack of data regulation surrounding technology companies.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Katherine Tassi, former Facebook and Uber privacy boss, admitted to the Daily Telegraph that Snapchat had previously had to &quot;work harder&quot; to generate advertising revenue thanks to its refusal to target its users &quot;to a level that makes people feel uncomfortable&quot;, like rival Facebook.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We approach advertising product from a different perspective and we have always had to be more creative to build personalised and relevant advertisement,&quot; Tassi said. &quot;We think that is our differentiator and that it will pay off. GDPR is levelling the playing field,&quot; she added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a glance | Your data rights</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Snapchat's popularity among young people made it hot property upon its 2016 New York stock exchange debut, but in the past three months has seen shares slide 50pc as the company struggles to engage users and prove its profitability. The unpopular app redesign in early 2018, which caused user growth to drop off, coupled with 2017's $40m (&pound;28m) writedown of unsold Spectacles stock has led analysts to downgrade its potential. Comparitively, Facebook's value remains intact despite the recent Cambridge Analytica data scandal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Snap and Facebook have been pitted against each other since Mark Zuckerberg bought Instagram, a direct rival to Snapchat, in 2012. Following the purchase, Instagram launched a feature called &quot;Stories&quot;, which shared the same function as Snapchat's tool of the exact same name.&nbsp; Stories was later added to Facebook.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Snap's long-held focus on privacy could see it outshine big players like Facebook, Instagram and Twitter now they have been forced to curb their data collection - or face fines. If found in breach of the law, Facebook faces a maximum fine of $1.1bn (&pound;777m). Growth may take a hit as the enforced transparency tools allows users to see how much information is collected on them and could lead them to permanently log out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Snapchat said that achieving compliance ahead of the GDPR &quot;wasn't a challenge&quot; and that &quot;data minimisation was already part of our privacy-by-design ethos&quot;. It will increase the amount of information that users can download so they can see exactly how their information is being used and what it is being stored for in its privacy settings over the coming weeks.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Companies found to be in breach of the GDPR face a maximum penalty of 4pc of global annual turnover or (EURO)20m (&pound;17.6m) depending on which is greater.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The threat of a cyberattack has replaced concerns over too much regulation as the top anxiety for banking executives, according to a survey of senior business figures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The study of 188 banking and capital markets chief executives, carried out by PWC, the consultants, found that 89 per cent said cybersecurity as a major worry. A total of 93 per cent said that they would be investing in this area over the next year.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Terrorism has also become a major headache for business leaders. Two-fifths of those polled said that they were extremely concerned by the threat of terrorism, compared to less than a quarter last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The speed of technological change was also a major worry, cited by 85 per cent of respondents. Almost half of CEOs polled said that they were not clear if artificial intelligence would improve customer experience, further highlighting digital issues common in many companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ciar&aacute;n Kelly, an advisory leader at PWC Ireland, said that there were two types of business experiences with cybercrime: &quot;Those that have experienced a major cyberattack and those that will.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Unsurprisingly, nothing is more likely to keep chief executives awake at night. The importance of cyberprotection to customer trust underlines the extent to which cyberthreats are a strategic rather than just IT risk,&quot; he said. He added that developments such as the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) &quot;make the need for more proactive safeguards, better coordination and more systematic response plans even more pressing&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GDPR rules, which govern the privacy practices of any company handling EU citizens' data, are due to come into force later this month. Several surveys have shown that many Irish companies are unprepared for the introduction of the rules, and multiple analysts have warned banking and finance firms to beef up their cybersecurity before their introduction. David Lee from PWC Ireland, said that banking and capital market organisations that have tried to bring in technologies without at the same time streamlining their core business &quot;have quickly come unstuck&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Technology can't reinvigorate innovation and returns without new ways of working, like human and machine collaboration,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">sir - I agree with Tim Wood's sentiments about the General Data Protection Regulations (Letters, May 12). A cornerstone of the GDPR is that an individual's data should not be used for marketing purposes without their specific consent.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Small businesses, organisations and charities can live with that. They should not need to go through a process of getting consent to hold data already provided by the individual for the use expected by that individual.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those wrestling with GDPR may not realise that one of the biggest holders of personal data is exempt, namely local authorities. In February 2018, on advice from the Information Commissioner's Office, the Electoral Commission advised electoral registration officers that GDPR does not apply to open electoral registers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In my constituency, St Ives, 43 per cent of the electorate have not applied to Cornwall council to &quot;opt out&quot;, so their names and addresses appear in the open register.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Considering the vast amounts of money so many people pay to spend their leisure time at football matches, The Fiver struggles to understand why so many of them seem to hate being at them. There are infinitely cheaper ways of reducing oneself to the state of angry, snarling, mouth-foaming maniac over the course of two hours, as anyone who has ever been put on hold by [insert pertinent energy/airline/mobile/insurance company name here] will readily testify. So on a fairly pointless final day of the league season that had about it an air of &quot;School's Out&quot;, The Fiver's c0ckles were warmed by almost unprecedented scenes at Huddersfield, where a Premier League football match was staged and almost every single person present seemed deliriously happy.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Terriers fans were happy, because their club is staying in the Premier League, having pulled off the admittedly not-quite-as-impressive-when-you-look-at-it feat of not being as rubbish as Swansea, Stoke and West Brom. Arsenal fans were happy because they're finally getting rid of Ars&egrave;ne Wenger, who in the course of 22 years at the club brought them unprecedented amounts of silverware, but whose most recent triumph at the club involved successfully zipping up his padded overcoat. Wenger was happy, because he would no longer have to contend with the abuse and cat-calls of various ingrates, many of whom have recently been tying themselves in knots in an effort to point out that wishing somebody well for the future having spent three years verbally abusing him in the nastiest possible terms does not make one a hypocrite. And finally, local light aircraft pilots were happy as there were so many planes trailing banners that the sky over the stadium resembled a scene from Dunkirk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In other unprecedented scenes, Wenger engaged in much unWengerlike behaviour: milking applause from all four sides of the ground, bowing with a flourish and gambolling across the pitch and down the tunnel, giving it a McCartney-esque two-thumbs aloft for the last time as Arsenal manager. &quot;I should have announced every week I retire,&quot; he said. &quot;People are so nice since I said that. I think what will remain is the formidable human aspect of the last 22 years - that is special and I will cherish that. I had fantastic human experiences at the club, above the results, it was a human adventure.&quot; On Sunday Wenger found himself drenched in the milk of universal human kindness. It was uncharacteristically warm, gloopy, civilised behaviour unbecoming of a football match and The Fiver didn't like it.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hopeless. We were training for cakes and Irn-Bru every day when we needed to be preparing for big games in the Premiership ... His track record wasn't great. He had a couple of relegations under his belt. But I don't want to bad-mouth him too much&quot; - Ross County midfielder Michael Gardyne fails pretty substantially, as he describes Owen Coyle after the club's Scottish Premiership relegation. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now that Ailsa from Home and Away has failed in the attempt to get two sides relegated from the Premier League in a single season, I think it's only fair to turn attention towards Phil Brown's achievements at an entirely different end of the spectrum. Kudos to him for stringing together a series of results to safely steer two clubs away from the play-offs. At Southend, he was sacked after a mid-season run of one win in 10; had we had the foresight to get rid just two games earlier then his successor, Chris Powell, would almost certainly have got the same squad into the League One top six. Dropping down a division, Phil was brought in by a Swindon side on the cusp of the play-offs but his two wins in 10 meant they avoided a highly stressful climax. Understandably, Phil has been rewarded by Swindon with a new contract so I guess he can relax in the sun this summer and reflect on two jobs [not] well done&quot; - Bryan Matthews.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In these saddest of times for Stoke City, perhaps the management team can learn from a local 13-year-old, who felt a need and went shopping on the internet. Surely there's a striker listed out there somewhere&quot; - Paul Benveniste.</SPAN></P>

That's how we imagine Mauricio Pochettino's meeting with Daniel Levy will start, the Tottenham manager is apparently insistent he wants extra bunce or he's going to load himself into the Do One cannon and fire himself somewhere less parsimonious.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For some mysterious reason, it sounds like West Ham fans aren't happy about being called &quot;keyboard warriors and malcontents&quot; by the club's vice-chair. As such, its been suggested Karren Brady might want to give her Sun column the elbow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The season is over so the more important business of transfers can now commence and first off the rank is Pablo Maffeo, politely invited by Manchester City to journey in the direction of Stuttgart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ailsa fancies sticking around at Southampton, but will they fancy that? &quot;The club will make a quick decision one way or the other,&quot; he parped. &quot;If it involves me, I will be delighted but I was given a short-term contract to come and do a job and that's what I've done.&quot; The tension is entirely bearable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Tranmere Rovers are back, baby. &quot;We've suffered, people have lost their jobs and to get the club back into the league is an unbelievably proud moment for me,&quot; cheered Micky Mellon after their preposterous win over Boreham Wood.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1940 an American nutritionist published a book called You Are What You Eat. It went on to sell half a million copies and Victor Lindlahr, its author, helped to popularise the health food movement. Perhaps we need a modern equivalent. Someone to observe our technological habits and tell us: You Are What You Post.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of us use social media; to say you don't is to be that guy in 1995 who loved to proclaim that he did not even own a television. Last August Ipsos, the market research company, said 64 per cent of Irish adults were Facebook users; 27 per cent used Instagram, also owned by Facebook; 28 per cent used Twitter; and 27 per cent used LinkedIn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All of these involve an image curation exercise that begins as soon as you create an account: you must choose a profile picture. What is the public face you want to present: the photo of you suited and booted from Gerard's wedding, or of you and Sam Maguire from the pub? You'll want to be careful about which activities you broadcast. Attended an exhibition at the IMMA? You had better believe that is getting posted to Facebook and LinkedIn both; can't hurt to have your colleagues know how cultured you are. Rainy Sunday binge of a season of RuPaul's Drag Race? Maybe save that one for Twitter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For companies such as Facebook (who are not alone, mind - the US National Security Agency is surely hoovering up digital crumbs as well), you are your online experience. It's not only the data you provide; your behaviour is also being mined. You may not have clicked &quot;like&quot; on that YouTube video but you watched it to the end, didn't you? Google noticed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The EU is aware of this and is introducing GDPR - the general data protection resolution, which comes into force on May 25. You may have seen email notifications from various companies, or perhaps you have noticed an increase in cookie consent. There will be much more of that in 2019: companies will be required to give you notice of the collection of your data, collect no more data than is necessary for the purpose for which it will be used, and to keep that data safe and secure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GDPR gives us the right to request copies of our data, but we should be more concerned about our activity. You don't need a copy of every hotel review you've left on TripAdvisor, but maybe you'd like to know that Facebook isn't keeping track of the number of times you look at your ex's wedding photos.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SIR - Playing games with her Cabinet and dividing them into two teams makes Theresa May seem more like a primary school teacher than Prime Minister.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Mrs May has the guts, and wishes to go down in history as a success, she must deliver full independence for Britain from the undemocratic EU.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given that the House of Commons <SPAN style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&#8232;</SPAN>is still about 60 per cent Remainer, <SPAN style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&#8232;</SPAN> if she is double-crossed by MPs and outvoted, she should show some <SPAN style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&#8232;</SPAN> faith and go once more to the country - unless she really is a Remainer double agent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Gerald Heath                      Corsham,Wiltshire</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SIR - The Government, in its leaflet to households on the EU referendum, said to the British people: &quot;This is your decision. The Government will implement what you decide.&quot; The British people voted to leave the EU.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Conservative election manifesto in 2017 stated its policy was for the UK to leave the single market and customs union. The Conservative party won the election and is in Government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So what is the basis for the actions of Conservative MPs and Conservative peers who are working to usurp the democratic will of the British people?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Paul Miller                      Lincoln</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SIR - The question of the Northern Ireland border often sees two separate issues conflated. One that can easily <SPAN style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&#8232;</SPAN>be resolved concerns different regulations on products and services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have been involved in exporting manufactured goods worldwide for 40 years. The regulations and standards that govern them are relevant at the point of sale, not the point of importation. It is illegal to sell a product that does not meet local standards in the majority of developed countries. In my experience they are never checked by customs for compliance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The issue of tariffs is more problematic. The EU is concerned about an import into the UK on one tariff (which may be lower than its own) being forwarded into Europe, creating &quot;unfair&quot; competition. This highlights the way tariffs are used to reduce competition and protect local producers rather than consumers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We should declare that we will allow goods from the EU to enter the UK tariff-free after Brexit. A solution <SPAN style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&#8232;</SPAN>to goods and services travelling the other way is for the EU to propose <SPAN style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&#8232;</SPAN>and for us to agree.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Julian Tope                      Portishead, Somerset</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SIR - The CBI and others put their weight behind a complicated scheme whereby the United Kingdom would collect EU tariffs and operate a computer program&nbsp;to sort out goods destined for the EU and goods destined for the UK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When has a complicated computer program organised by HM Government worked?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     His Honour Lord Parmoor                      High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   Flagship to launch                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SIR - Boris Johnson, the Foreign Secretary, was taken to task by the Prime Minister for asserting that after Brexit, Britain must be unfettered in its trade with the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He believes that membership of the customs partnership, now under Cabinet consideration, would restrict that ability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In effect Mr Johnson was only reflecting Theresa May's mantra: &quot;Brexit means Brexit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this new environment many people think that the Commonwealth should be an important focus for expansion of trade. Its GDP growth out-performs the EU's and has done for years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Take India - a country with a new and massive middle class and a tempting market for our financial services, other invisibles and high-end consumer goods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps Mr Johnson will endorse the new private-sector initiative aimed at building and operating a literal Flagship to promote trade, education and environmental awareness among Commonwealth countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This would be a statement of confidence in the future of British business and could give practical help to those in less fortunate corners of the Commonwealth, where education and profitable trade need to underlie their road to a better life.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SIR - The fa&ccedil;ade of the Old Vic theatre (Arts, May 10) was reconstructed in 1983 based on the 1830 appearance, incorporating simplified moulding profiles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The present all-over flattening colour wash with &quot;The Old Vic&quot; crudely painted over the same name incised in the stone under it (which shows through) can only have been done by a vandal.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SIR - I agree with Tim Wood's sentiments about the General Data Protection Regulations (Letters, May 12). A cornerstone of the GDPR is that an individual's data should not be used for marketing purposes without their specific consent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Small businesses, organisations and charities can live with that. They should not need to go through a process of getting consent to hold data already provided by the individual for the use expected by that individual.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those wrestling with GDPR may not realise that one of the biggest holders of personal data is exempt, namely local authorities. In February 2018, on advice from the Information Commissioner's Office, the Electoral Commission advised electoral registration officers that GDPR does not apply to open electoral registers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In my constituency, St Ives, 43 per cent of the electorate have not applied to Cornwall council to &quot;opt out&quot;, so their names and addresses appear in the open register.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SIR - Dr Laurence Buckman is an experienced GP and entitled to his own opinion (report, &quot;Younger GPs 'really don't like' working long hours, says senior medic as pressure piles on surgeries,&quot; May 9).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Royal College of GPs takes issue with his comments about younger GPs &quot;not liking&quot; to work long hours - as will every &quot;young&quot; GP who is dedicated to our profession and working flat-out seeing patients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the wider context, his comments were highlighting unmanageable workloads in general practice - something that is also of huge concern to the Royal College of GPs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, in general practice, we will see more than a million patients, dealing with complex illnesses that even a decade ago would have been automatically referred to hospital consultants. Colleagues who are newer to the profession play a vital role.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We agree that GPs are generally working longer and longer days, which is no good for them or their patients. But regardless of their level of experience, no GP should be expected to work a 14-hour day. Burnout among GPs is becoming increasingly common.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's why the College has been campaigning for more GPs and adequate funding across the United Kingdom to ensure family doctors and their patients benefit from the safest working environments possible, both now and in the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We also need to ensure that all GPs are able to balance their working lives with their home lives to protect their own health and wellbeing, as well as that of their patients.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SIR - Richard Luscombe (Letters, May 11) is fortunate to get a cheaper haircut with his balding pate. When I asked my barber why he was increasing the price of my haircut as I had reducing amounts of hair he replied: &quot;Oh, that includes the search fee.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SIR - I grew up with the main Waterloo-Bournemouth line on an embankment running along the bottom of our garden. In the days of steam the permanent way was kept meticulously clear of any vegetation other than grass, to minimise the risk of fire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now embankments are covered in trees and bushes, and the problem is leaves on the line and fallen trees. The solution must be to return it to how it used to be.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SIR - Ben Bradley MP and the charity Buglife deserve every success in their quest for suitable sites to establish &quot;wildlife corridors&quot; to protect bees, butterflies and moths (report, May 10).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With 20,000 miles of railway embankments facing a five-year, multi-million pound &quot;enhanced level&quot; of tree clearance, Network Rail could at least help to provide a valuable habitat for the wildflowers and pollinators we so urgently need.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If trees do, indeed, need to be felled, then some joined-up thinking should be encouraged by including railways in the forthcoming Protection of Pollinators Bill.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SIR - Undoubtedly, some, as Scripture says &quot;have the gift of prophecy&quot;, and more often than not you are right in your Leading Articles, but I have a concern about the third leader on May 10. You say that Meghan Markle was &quot;successfully christened&quot; by the Archbishop of Canterbury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The service order offers these words to the candidate for Baptism: &quot;Fight valiantly as a disciple of Christ against sin, the world and the devil, and remain faithful to Christ to the end of your life.&quot; Surely, we will not know whether the Baptism was successful until Meghan's earthly life is done.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This said, I am confident in the Archbishop's preparation of Ms Markle, which, with the baptismal ceremony and the forthcoming marriage, will enable this delightful couple to bring joy and hope to ours and coming generations.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SIR - The behaviour of some professed Christians makes it appear probable some christenings are unsuccessful.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SIR - Among unsuccessful christenings was surely that of the Byzantine emperor Constantine V (718-75). Legend says that at the critical moment of the ceremony the child fouled the font, earning himself the soubriquet by which history has known him: Constantine Copronymus.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">sir - Peter Mellor (Letters, May 10) is right about the colossal waste of resources expended by small clubs and organisations to comply with the confusing minefield of the General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am the honorary secretary of a local yacht club and have spent much time on our compliance with the regulations. I believe that virtually all processing of data by membershipbased organisations can be done on the basis of &quot;legitimate interests&quot; or &quot;proper performance of the contract with the data subject&quot;, both expressly permitted by Article 6 of the www.GDPR.No extra &quot;consent&quot; is necessary unless a member's data is used in a manner they would not reasonably have expected from the organisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet one cannot blame club secretaries for taking the &quot;safe option&quot; of obtaining consent, as the regulations are so impenetrably written that only a lawyer's mind could begin to understand them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Online, there is a virtual feeding frenzy of lawyers and consultants trying to frighten the unwary into using their high-priced services. There has been a dire shortage from the Information Commissioner's Office of advice in plain English to help those small membership organisations currently being left to flounder. Tim Wood Wivenhoe, Essex sir - If it is true that &quot;individuals must opt in whenever data is collected on them&quot; (report, May 8), must a police officer ask criminals for consent to be investigated? Of course not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is an unfortunate myth about the GDPR, which has been debunked on many occasions, not least by the Information Commissioner herself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are, in fact, six general bases on which personal data can lawfully be processed, and the data subject's consent is just one of those (and is often not the most appropriate option). Jon Baines Data Protection Adviser Mishcon de Reya London WC2 sir - The GDPR are being used by every crook in the country to get at one's data. I received an email purporting to be from PayPal asking me to &quot;update&quot; data held on me. The return email address looked genuine enough, though rather long.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Next morning, a call from my bank asked if I had made certain payments. I was then contacted again and advised of means to &quot;correct this situation&quot;. I was asked to go through certain steps, with both the man on the line and I seeing the same screen bank data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I broke off for an appointment, and on phoning the bank later found it knew nothing of the morning's happenings. The morning's online and phone business had been fraudulent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My bank was of considerable assistance in getting me new cards and freezing my accounts while making moves to restore my funds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As far as I can see, the only response to any online request to &quot;update&quot; your data is to ignore it.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Urgent action required &quot;, &quot;Do you still want to hear from us?&quot;, &quot;We've updated our privacy policy&quot;, &quot;Should we stop sending you updates? If not, act now!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of us will have received emails like this during the past few weeks, some of them from companies we haven't used for years or have maybe never even heard of.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Triggering this deluge of emails is something called GDPR that comes into effect in just under two weeks' time. Often the emails warn that if you don't respond, you will be removed from the company's database, which raises a lot of questions. What action, if any, do you need to take? Could it affect you financially? If you ignore the emails, will you wake up one morning to find tumbleweed blowing through your inbox?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GDPR, which stands for General Data Protection Regulation, has been described as the biggest overhaul of online privacy since the birth of the internet. It is designed to give all EU citizens the right to know what data is stored on them and to have it deleted, plus protect them from privacy and data breaches. It comes into effect on 25 May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This comes just weeks after it was revealed that the personal data of millions of people was harvested from Facebook and improperly shared with the political consultancy Cambridge Analytica.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new rules bolster the requirement for explicit and informed consent before data is processed. As a result, companies and organisations around the world are contacting users to check they are happy to carry on receiving their&nbsp;emails.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Typically, individuals are being asked to give explicit permission for the company to continue emailing them and holding their data. Many companies are also giving people the chance to opt out from all future communication.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, many of us seem to be going down with &quot;GDPR fatigue&quot;: one article last week claimed that the &quot;reconfirmation rate&quot; - the proportion of people saying they want to continue receiving a company's emails - at UK micro-businesses was averaging just 10%, which meant &quot;they could lose 90% of their subscribers - the life-blood for their business&quot;. So it's no wonder some firms have resorted to tactics such as offering to enter people into a prize draw in return for them going in and updating their communication preferences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The average adult is said to have about 100 &quot;data relationships&quot; - companies and organisations that hold our personal data. These can include things such as clubs we belong to, retailers we have shopped at, professional bodies we are signed up to in connection with our job, and the companies that provide our insurance policies. So they will receive as many as 100 GDPR-related emails - though some are receiving a lot more than that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Companies are handling this in different ways. Some are taking the trouble to explain what's happening, while others are more vague. Equally, some companies make it easy for people to consent - you hit the &quot;Yes, I agree&quot; button on the email, then you get a thank-you, and that's that. Others are insisting you go through the rigmarole of logging in, which might entail trying to remember your password or setting up a new account.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It will be their interpretation of what they need to do to be compliant,&quot; says Robert Parker at the UK's Information Commissioner's Office (ICO).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So will you hear from every company you have dealings with? Probably not, suggests the ICO. In a blog this week aimed at firms and organisations, the ICO deputy information commissioner, Steve Wood, says: &quot;Where you have an existing relationship with customers who have purchased goods or services from you, it may not be necessary to obtain fresh consent.&quot; He adds that firms &quot;do not need to automatically refresh all existing consents in preparation for the new law&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, your relationship with your bank is different to your relationship with a company that, say, occasionally emails you newsletters. When you opened your account, you entered into a contract with the bank, and it is in regular contact with you, sending you changes to terms and conditions and so on. So your bank may well be confident that you are happy with the way it contacts you and how it stores your personal information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the reason why the company that occasionally emails you newsletters is now asking for your consent is perhaps because you never explicitly gave it permission to send you stuff. Maybe you only get its emails because you went to an event it organised ages ago or you once downloaded something from its website. Under the new regime, that almost certainly wouldn't count as explicit and informed consent, hence its getting in touch now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bottom line is that if it is a company or organisation that you want to continue hearing from, you should probably click the button or log in to ensure you keep getting its emails. If it doesn't hear from you, it may decide to err on the side of caution and take you off its database. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is, however, a good opportunity to check that the companies you deal with have your correct details, and to spring-clean your overstuffed inbox by ditching annoying marketing emails that you no longer want to receive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   How GDPR works                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) restricts the way businesses collect, store and move people's personal data. It applies to all companies that process the personal data of people located within the EU.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Personal data includes your name, photo, email address, IP address, bank details, posts on a social networking site, medical information, biometric data and sexual orientation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under GDPR, people get expanded rights to obtain the data a&nbsp;company has collected about them. People will have the &quot;right to be forgotten&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also, if a company has a data breach, it must be reported to the relevant authority within 72 hours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To ensure companies comply, GDPR gives regulators the power to fine firms up to (EURO)20m (&pound;17.6m) or 4% of annual global turnover, whichever is greater.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After questioning the Goodison Park postman yet again about the puzzling lack of fan mail delivered to his purpose-built, gold-initialed BS letterbox, Big Sam Allardyce went ahead with an early press conference on Friday and addressed other issues, including the prospect of Wayne Rooney upping sticks to the USA! USA!! USA!!! &quot;I don't get involved in transfers but there seems to be an interest from DC United,&quot; he warbled. &quot;My understanding is there seems to have been some negotiation along the line but as for clarity as to whether Wayne is staying or going, we'll see later on ... but let's be clear, Wayne Rooney hasn't asked to leave.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whenever suggestions of Rooney going somewhere foreign have surfaced in the past, they have been accompanied by widespread, patronising t1tters suggesting this is a grown man who could not handle any kind of change of culture. The Fiver is not convinced those concerns are valid, especially this time. Admittedly, we have never heard of DC United but if, as we hope, they are affiliated to the comics, then that means Rooney will be surrounded by characters such as Two-Face, Darkseid, Sinestro, Reverse Flash and Bizarro, which doesn't sound all that different to a Premier League dressing room.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rooney might even befriend some superhero over there with the power to reverse the ageing process, and what a happy encounter that would be for a 32-year-old with an unforgiving body. What is more, he might learn and feed back to fellow Evertonians who are unmoved by Big Sam's football the details of the life of Bizarro, who, of course, was created with a duplicating ray by Lex Luthor to be a mirror image of Superman that Luthor could control. But things didn't go to the villain's plan and Bizarro came into being feeling a lot like The Fiver does on a Saturday night, wailing: &quot;Me not human ... me not creature.. me not even animal! Me unhappy! Me don't know difference between right and wrong, good and evil!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Things got really sticky when Bizarro became infatuated with Lois Lane. Happily, Lane was quick-witted enough to use a duplicating ray on herself and create Bizarro Lois, who immediately fell in love with Bizarro. The smitten couple departed to settle down together on another planet. The lesson being, Everton fans, that there is always a mutually convenient way to end a relationship that you're not getting any joy out of. So long as you can find a duplicating ray and/or some helpful DC characters.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; Due to GDPR I've had to re-subscribe to The Fiver and, in doing so, I see you're introducing a new format promising 'news and gossip in our own belligerent, sometimes intelligent and - very occasionally - funny way'. Can't you just stick with the old format? I don't quite know why, but I kinda like it the way it is&quot; - Phil Smyth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Reading about the Bunnymen (yesterday's Quote of the Day) brings to mind the last time Liverpool won Big Cup. I worked for a concert promoter at the time, and we had Oasis playing a too-small-for-them venue in south London. After much tense negotiation the band agreed to delay their performance, with the match being shown in the venue on a big screen. You can imagine the powers of persuasion needed to coax the Gallaghers from their dressing room, considerably further delayed by both extra-time and penalties, only to be serenaded on stage to Liverpool chants which continued between every song of their set. Happy days&quot; - Neil Wyatt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Bunnies have changed their minds and will now play in Brum while the Reds do battle with Los Blancos &quot; - David Morgans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The fashion for holding up tatty pieces of cardboard (yesterday's Fiver letters) started with song suggestions at Springsteen concerts. Not that we're likely to see 'Born to Run' held up in an attempt to inspire Reading's notoriously immobile forwards&quot; - Alan Giles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I noticed that Boreham Wood (yesterday's letters) are from Borehamwood. Splitting apart your place of origin's name is a sadly underused naming method for teams.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Name: Klout.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Age: 10.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Appearance: Kaput.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     I heard three nimrods talking about their Klout scores in a bar recently. Does that have anything to do with this?  Indeed it does. In fact, Klout was pretty much the &quot;three nimrods sitting in a bar&quot; of social media.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     I thought that was Twitter.  No, that is 10 nimrods arguing outside the bar. For clarity, let's say that Instagram is one person kissing themself in a bar mirror and LinkedIn is a businessman touching himself in a pub toilet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Gotcha.  Anyway, Klout was a slightly different social media tool, in that it analysed your Twitter and Facebook accounts for followers, retweets, shares and mentions and then awarded you a &quot;Klout score&quot; - a number between one and 100 - that reflected how influential you were.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     OK, great. I have one question.  Would that question be, by any chance: &quot;Why?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     It would!  Well, that is harder to say. It may be&nbsp;because, in this hard-thrusting digital age, a&nbsp;good Klout score could give you the edge in the recruitment field. Or it may be because people are very needy. Either way, it doesn't matter. Klout is closing shop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Oh no! Why? The long answer is that it was acquired by a company called Lithium Technologies, which plans to harvest the tool's artificial intelligence and machine-learning capabilities for use in its other products. Also, it may have something to do with the implementation of GDPR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Is there a short answer?  Sure: because it was&nbsp;stupid. Klout took the entire spectrum of human interaction and condensed it to a two-digit number that you could use to bludgeon anyone who failed to adhere to its scoring algorithm. It was tacky and basic and cheap.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Did you have a Klout score? I did.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     What was it? A measly 62, even though it said I was an expert in subjects such as journalism, publishing and - oh - Made in Chelsea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     What does it mean now that Klout has died? It&nbsp;means we have entered a more sophisticated age of interaction. We have come to realise that the infinite richness of the human condition does not easily lend itself to the kind of cold, hard, robotic quantification that Klout offered. Make no mistake, this is a beat of the drum. A loud, organic beat that says: &quot;We are still here and we are more beautifully complicated than you could ever know.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Really? Well, it also means that Lithium Technologies is planning to bring out &quot;a new social-impact scoring methodology based on Twitter&quot; very shortly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Do say: &quot;Klout is klosed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Don't say: &quot;No wonder you are happy. You are such a 46.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">OPINION; Version:1</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1794 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SIR&nbsp;- Peter Mellor ( Letters, May 10 ) is right about the colossal waste of resources expended by small clubs and organisations to comply with the confusing minefield of the General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am the honorary secretary of a local yacht club and have spent much time on our compliance with the regulations. I believe that virtually all processing of data by membership-based organisations can be done on the basis of &quot;legitimate interests&quot; or &quot;proper performance of the contract with the data subject&quot;, both expressly permitted by Article 6 of the GDPR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No extra &quot;consent&quot; is necessary unless a member's data is used in a manner they would not reasonably have expected from the organisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet one cannot blame club secretaries for taking the &quot;safe option&quot; of obtaining consent, as the regulations are so impenetrably written that only a lawyer's mind could begin to understand them.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Online, there is a virtual feeding frenzy of lawyers and consultants trying to frighten the unwary into using their high-priced services. There has been a dire shortage from the Information Commissioner's Office of advice in plain English to help those small membership organisations currently being left to flounder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Tim Wood                      Wivenhoe, Essex</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SIR - If it is true that &quot; individuals must opt in whenever data is collected on them &quot;, must a police officer ask criminals for consent to be investigated? Of course not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is an unfortunate myth about the GDPR, which has been debunked on many occasions, not least by the Information Commissioner herself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are, in fact, six general bases on which personal data can lawfully be processed, and the data subject's consent is just one of those (and is often not the most appropriate option).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Jon Baines                      Data Protection Adviser,&nbsp;Mishcon de Reya London WC2</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a glance | Your data rights</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SIR&nbsp;- The GDPR are being used by every crook in the country to get at one's data. I received an email purporting to be from PayPal asking me to &quot;update&quot; data held on me. The return email address looked genuine enough, though rather long.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Next morning, a call from my bank asked if I had made certain payments. I was then contacted again and advised of means to &quot;correct this situation&quot;. I was asked to go through certain steps, with both the man on the line and I seeing the same screen bank data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I broke off for an appointment, and on phoning the bank later found it knew nothing of the morning's happenings. The morning's online and phone business had been fraudulent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My bank was of considerable assistance in getting me new cards and freezing my accounts&nbsp;while making moves to restore my funds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As far as I can see, the only response to any online request to &quot;update&quot; your data is to ignore it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     David E Hockin                      Portishead, Somerset</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   Saying the unsayable                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SIR&nbsp;- Congratulations to Allister Heath (Comment, May 10) for his &quot;unfashionable&quot; support for President Trump in ending US participation in the Iran nuclear deal. He is right that &quot;appeasing expansionist rogue states rarely works&quot;. Iran is, as he says, &quot;now the world's number one terror state.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His article is important because, as Kemi Badenoch MP points out, unfashionable views are increasingly unsayable as &quot;virtual lynch mobs ... intimidate anyone who doesn't pass the test of 'acceptable' comment&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moreover, Labour's shocking attempt to restrict press freedom through an amendment to the Data Protection Bill was defeated by a mere nine votes in the Commons on Wednesday, but, as she says, &quot;the enemies of free expression will no doubt return in a different form&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     William Shawcross                      London W2</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SIR - It is difficult to be content with the result of Wednesday's parliamentary debate on Tom Watson's amendments to the Data Protection Bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That there should be 295 elected MPs who are so ignorant and so unaware of the importance of our fundamental and hard-won rights and freedoms is deeply depressing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Mike Kaye                      Nocton, Lincolnshire</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SIR - Let us not be complacent. A vote of 304 to 295 tells us that, in this country, freedom of the press is a very delicate flower that needs all the tender, loving care we can give it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Doug Clark                      Currie, Midlothian</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SIR - The mentality of those MPs who sought to curb the freedom of the press in Wednesday's debate is best understood in the words of Wilhelm von Humboldt: &quot;The desire for domination, the insensibility to the beauty of freedom, show that a man is in love with slavery, merely not wishing to be a slave himself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Dr Max Gammon                      London SE16 &nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   Troubles and trials                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SIR - The news that a British soldier will face trial for a fatal shooting in Northern Ireland 44 years ago ( Leading Article, May 10 ) adds urgency to the need to prevent hundreds of cases being brought to court, even though the maximum punishment for Troubles-related killings is a derisory two-year sentence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year, four professors of law confirmed to the Defence Select Committee that a statute of limitations, precluding future prosecutions, would conform to international law if two conditions were met. First, it must apply to all sides in the conflict, not just Service personnel and other security forces. Secondly, it must be coupled with a &quot;truth-recovery process&quot; in which participants in fatal incidents could speak freely without fear of prosecution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Responding to the Committee's subsequent report, the Government stated that it intends to include within its forthcoming consultation on the draft Northern Ireland (Stormont House Agreement) Bill a section entitled &quot;Alternative approaches to addressing the past&quot;. The consultation will invite respondents to give their views on &quot;the potential effectiveness and appropriateness of alternative approaches such as amnesties and a statute of limitations to address the legacy of Northern Ireland&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Government now appears to be breaking this promise, presumably because Unionist politicians do not want terrorists to avoid prosecution and Republican politicians take the same view regarding security personnel. Yet, having had discussions with both Sinn Fein and DUP parliamentarians, I believe that both sides could live with a comprehensive solution - of the sort pioneered by Nelson Mandela in South Africa - even though, for political reasons, they cannot say so openly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those who lost loved ones will <SPAN style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&#8232;</SPAN>more likely find closure from a truth-recovery process, coupled with immunity from prosecution, than <SPAN style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&#8232;</SPAN> from the current alternative of trials, denials and very short sentences in <SPAN style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&#8232;</SPAN>the event of conviction. It is up to our Government to give a lead and act.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Troubles                   Unburied                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SIR - A neighbour died at the beginning of December with no <SPAN style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&#8232;</SPAN>next of kin. Some five months on, <SPAN style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&#8232;</SPAN>he still lies in the mortuary with <SPAN style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&#8232;</SPAN>no funeral in sight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am appalled and think the situation unacceptable.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   The profitable art of splitting rail tickets                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SIR - Rail bosses now admit that &quot; splitting tickets saves money &quot;. I have been ticket splitting for years. My wife and I regularly use the train for leisure travel and, except for local journeys, I always book split tickets. This involves a bit of effort but yields considerable savings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, the off-peak return fare with a railcard from Cheltenham Spa to Exeter St David's is &pound;37.95. If you use the same service but book tickets from Cheltenham Spa to Bristol (&pound;6.40 return); Bristol to Taunton (&pound;9.10 return); and Taunton to Exeter (&pound;8.05 return),&nbsp;the journey costs &pound;23.55 - a saving of &pound;14.40, or 38 per cent. It seems ridiculous that customers have to go through this time-consuming process just to get the cheapest fare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chief downside of split ticketing is the number of tickets produced. I managed to set a new personal record on Monday when my wife and I travelled to South Devon - I had to use 29 tickets to cover our journey.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SIR - Split ticketing is specifically allowed in the National Rail Conditions of Travel booklet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Interestingly, the current issue of the booklet, dated March 11 2018, has a much-reduced explanation of split ticketing - just in time to muddy the waters before the current review perhaps.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   Brainy Brexodus                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SIR - Your report &quot; Prediction of an academic 'Brexodus' has not come true &quot; (May 10) overlooks the fact that Britain has not yet left the EU, and so the full effects on the university sector have not yet been felt. Indeed, the Government has yet to publish its Immigration Bill and rules.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is deep uncertainty in the academic community about the status of EU citizens in the UK after Brexit. Some 40,000 non-UK EU staff contribute to our world-leading universities. The net increase in EU academics arriving in Britain in 2017 reflects the desire of many to establish a career here before Brexit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Academics decide about careers and funding applications often years in advance. Current uncertainty, should it go unresolved, risks making Britain a less attractive destination for the world's brightest minds after Brexit.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   Plenty of good, kind people left in England                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SIR &nbsp;- My faith in human nature has been restored: on Wednesday I met lots of good Samaritans after I punctured a tyre on my car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A lady and her daughter helped to identify my exact location for the AA. They then came and checked that I wasn't waiting by myself in the dark.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two different young men stopped and offered help in a friendly, non intimidating way, and when the AA man arrived he provided an excellent service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In case we all forget, there are lots of good, kind people in England.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SIR - Since the country that wins this evening's Eurovision Song Contest will have to host and pay for next year's finals, may I suggest that our own entrants ensure that they don't win (probably not difficult).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HOMEOWNERS are likely to receive more junk mail after Royal Mail offered to help businesses exploit a loophole in new data protection laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Firms across the country have been told they can get around a crackdown on unwanted marketing by sending unaddressed letters through the post.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under EU laws coming into force on May 25, businesses must have permission or a legitimate reason to send messages to members of the public. But in recent weeks, Royal Mail has sent out pamphlets reminding businesses &quot;don't forget the power of unaddressed mail&quot; as away to contact people without needing their personal data.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last night, MPs accused the Royal Mail of encouraging junk mail, which they described as &quot;frustrating&quot; and &quot;a waste of paper&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The average household receives around 650 pieces of junk mail a year, despite efforts by government and regulators to curb the problem. Staff at Royal Mail's door-to-door leaflet helpline said there had been an increased demand for their services in recent weeks, with more boxes of leaflets than usual waiting to be distributed to homes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1983, the Mailing Preference Service was established to enable consumers to refuse to receive junk mail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, households that sign up to the service are still not protected from unaddressed letters, and can expect to receive as many as seven unaddressed leaflets per day through their letterbox from Royal Mail alone. The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), which is regulating the introduction of so-called &quot;General Data Protection Regulation&quot; (GDPR), also cannot take action against unaddressed mail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ian Murray, the Labour MP for Edinburgh South, said: &quot;I think the public would be surprised that, as a result of tighter and more up-to-date data protection laws, they receive even more unwanted junk mail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Individual businesses will determine if this kind of blanket junk mail marketing works, but I'm sure most consumers would see it as an unwanted waste of paper.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Julian Knight MP, a member of the digital, culture, media and sport committee, said: &quot;The new rules are about positive consent for how your data is used, so you are always in control of how are you are contacted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For too long, our private personal data has been used for purposes which people haven't consented to, resulting in frustrating amounts of information  and junk mail for consumers. Businesses, including Royal Mail, should not be trying to find ways around this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consumer groups have also criticised Royal Mail for failing to promote responsible marketing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">James Daley, a director at Fairer Finance, the consumer group, said: &quot;It is particularly disappointing to see an organisation that was until recently owned by the Government failing to stick by the spirit of the rules.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;GDPR is being introduced to protect people from spam and unwanted mail. Clearly, businesses need to be able to market responsibly, but encouraging unwanted advertising doesn't sound particularly responsible to me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If we can't rely on Royal Mail to lead the way, then we can't expect much of anyone else.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokesman for Royal Mail insisted its door-to-door leaflet service was &quot;valuable&quot;. He said: &quot;We take our responsibility as a media owner very seriously and we comply with relevant advertising laws and regulations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Targeted door-to-door mailings help to underpin the Universal Service. They provide a very valuable service to companies of all kinds as they seek to provide their goods and services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are committed to giving households control over the unaddressed mail they receive so that they can make an informed choice. Royal Mail runs a door-to-door opt-out scheme if customers want to stop receiving unaddressed mail.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An ICO spokesman said: &quot;If an organisation is sending mail or leaflets to every address in an area and does not know the identity of the people at those addresses, it is not processing personal data for direct marketing, and the GDPR rules will not apply.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;However, it may still need to comply with other guidelines and codes on marketing and advertising.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Homeowners face a deluge of junk mail after the Royal Mail encouraged businesses to exploit a loophole in data protection laws.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Companies across the UK have been advised by the Royal Mail to send unaddressed letters in a bid to dodge new EU laws that hope to crackdown on junk mail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new laws, which will come into force on May 25, will only allow businesses to send letters to the public if they have specific permission or a legitimate reason, the Telegraph reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Royal Mail has found a loophole and has sent out pamphlets telling firms how to navigate the new restrictions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The leaflet reminded firms: 'Don't forget the power of unaddressed mail' as a way to contact people without needing their personal details.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MPs and campaigners have called the move 'frustrating' and an 'unwanted waste of paper' and suggested the Royal Mail have not behaved responsibly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ian Murray, Labour MP for Edinburgh South, told the Daily Telegraph: 'I think the public would be surprised that as a result of tighter and more up-to-date data protection laws they receive even more unwanted junk mail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Individual businesses will determine if this kind of blanket junk mail marketing works but I'm sure most consumers would see it as an unwanted waste of paper.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Julian Knight MP, a member of the digital, culture, media and sport committee, said: 'The new rules are about positive consent for how your data is used, so you are always in control of how are you are contacted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'For too long our private personal data has been used for purposes which people haven't consented for, resulting in frustrating amounts of information and junk mail for consumers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Businesses including the Royal Mail should not be trying to find ways around this.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although in 1983 the Mailing Preference Service was set up so households could opt out of receiving junk mail, it is thought that on average customers still receive around 650 pieces of unwanted mail a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But those who sign up for the service are not protected from unaddressed letters. Even with the introduction of the new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in May, unaddressed letters could still get through.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some families could receive up to seven unaddressed leaflets per day from Royal Mail alone and the regulator, the Information Commissioner's Office, would not be able to do anything about it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">James Daley, director at consumer group Fairer Finance, told the Daily Telegraph: 'It is particularly disappointing to see an organisation that was until recently owned by the Government failing to stick by the spirit of the rules.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'GDPR is being introduced to protect people from spam and unwanted mail. Clearly businesses need to be able to market responsibly, but encouraging unwanted advertising doesn't sound particularly responsible to me. If we can't rely on Royal Mail to lead the way, then we can't expect much of anyone else.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokesman for the Royal Mail said: 'We take its responsibility as a media owner very seriously and we comply with relevant advertising laws and regulations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Targeted door-to-door mailings help to underpin the Universal Service. They provide a very valuable service to companies of all kinds as they seek to provide their goods and services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We are committed to giving households control over the unaddressed mail they receive so that they can make an informed choice. Royal Mail runs a door-to-door opt-out scheme for unaddressed mail if customers want to stop receiving unaddressed mail.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An ICO spokesman said: 'If an organisation is sending mail or leaflets to every address in an area and does not know the identity of the people at those addresses, it is not processing personal data for direct marketing, and the GDPR rules will not apply. However, it may still need to comply with other guidelines and codes on marketing and advertising.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even if it does, it will have to accept ongoing deep levels of oversight by the European Court of Justice, potentially breaching one of the UK's negotiation &quot;red lines&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Government and the EU announced on Friday that data protection was a &quot;cross-cutting&quot; topic in their framework for talks, and David Davis told MPs last month that data is the &quot;biggest single area of intergovernmental work of anything we're doing&quot;. However, lawyers, trade experts and industry bodies have all raised concerns about the practicalities of keeping data flowing post-Brexit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both ECJ oversight of data disputes and the rights of EU citizens when it comes to data gathering by intelligence services could present major negotiation hurdles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Giles Derrington of industry body techUK said that the complexity involved with protecting data flows between the EU and UK had only been fully appreciated by Government in the last few months. &quot;If you can't get this over the line you can't get a good Brexit deal,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once it quits the EU the UK will lose a vital exemption for the data activities of its security services, granted to it as an EU member state. Under the Lisbon Treaty, the activities of the UK's security services were free from EU data rules. That will no longer apply once it leaves the bloc and seeks a green light from Brussels to receive EU data, an essential process in almost every transaction consumers and businesses make. The EU has already said that the UK &quot;cannot be trusted&quot; with secure information. Now experts are calling on the Government to realise this has serious implications for commercial activities too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UK does not start from a point of equivalence with all other EU countries on the way it handles data, in part because of the mass surveillance activities of its security services. Its post-Brexit data handling will therefore not be solely judged on compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) - the overarching law intended to protect the rights of EU citizens over their data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other activities, such as passing details about EU citizens to other third countries due to security agreements, will also have to be considered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hosuk Lee-Makiyama, a former diplomat who has represented the EU at the World Trade Organisation, told The Daily Telegraph: &quot;The security relationship the UK has with third countries cannot be changed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is where I foresee a major stumbling block. The adequacy decision contains other criteria - you can't just copy and paste GDPR and assume you will be compliant.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some major economies have not been granted a so-called adequacy decision needed in order to use EU citizens' data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Canada only has an agreement which covers commercial information, and Australia has not been given an adequacy rating by the EU, despite giving the EU one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UK is seeking to ensure that the Information Commissioner's Office is recognised under a bespoke data agreement with the EU.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Experts believe that will require accepting that the ECJ as the ultimate decision maker in some data disputes, risking a clash with a Brexit negotiation red line.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Derrington said: &quot;If we want the UK's data protection regulator to help shape how the rules work and be able to hold companies to account if data is abused, then that means being part of a system in which the ultimate interpretation of the law is the ECJ.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Government have rightly said they want to be part of the EU's data protection system because it is so important to our economy and our security, but it will require a blurring of the ECJ red line.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Allie Renison of the Institute of Directors said: &quot;It is hard to imagine that any future deal on personal data flows between the UK and EU could be completely immune from review by the European court.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Department for Exiting the EU said that, in March, Prime Minister Theresa May confirmed that the jurisdiction of the ECJ in the UK must end. &quot;It also means that the ultimate arbiter of disputes about our future partnership cannot be the court of either party,&quot; Mrs May said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A caveat that ECJ rulings would continue to &quot;affect&quot; the UK was applied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government is being warned that it will face judicial review proceedings in June unless it scraps a clause in the data protection bill that would prevent immigrants from accessing their Home Office records.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaign groups the3million, a grassroots organisation representing EU citizens living in the UK, and the Open Rights Group argue that the exemption for data protection for immigrants is unlawful and will make EU citizens and others &quot;second-class citizens&quot; without full access to government files.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rosa Curling, a human rights lawyer at Leigh Day, which has been hired by the groups, said the exemption is of major concern given that EU citizens will soon have to register for &quot;settled status&quot; in Britain after Brexit. If they are denied this, they will find it difficult to appeal without access to their Home Office records, she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If the exemption is made law, our clients will apply for judicial review. They have spent months trying to persuade the government to remove the exemption from the bill,&quot; Curling said. &quot;If they continue to refuse to listen, our clients will have no option but to seek the court's intervention in this matter on an urgent basis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leigh Day is planning to write to the government this week to warn of legal action by the campaign groups if Theresa May does not remove the exemption at the third reading of the bill in the House of Commons on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 2018 Data Protection Act is due to become law on 25 May and was designed to implement General Data Protection Regulation rules, bringing data protection up to date across the EU. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the proposed legislation says GDPR provisions will not apply &quot;to personal data process for any of the following purposes: the maintenance of effective immigration control or the investigation or detection of activities that would undermine the maintenance of effective immigration control&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Curling said the exemption was &quot;counter to the goal&quot; of GDPR and will have implications for all citizens who come into contact with immigration procedures. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This affects anyone coming into contact with the immigration process, not just immigrants. It exempts controllers processing any personal data for the unclear and undefined concept of 'effective immigration control', so immigrants and citizens alike,&quot; she said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because of the general nature of the exemption, it could prevent people from accessing data from all public organisations caught up in Home Office decisions, including HMRC, the police and private contractors such as G4S.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaign groups say the Windrush scandal underlines how casually lives can be harmed by Home Office mistakes and, if the data protection bill becomes law, EU citizens could be left in a similar position. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gudrun Parasie, a lawyer with the3million, said: &quot;The Windrush case has proved yet again that the Home Office prefers to hide their mistakes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a complete breakdown of access to justice. Someone could press the wrong button and you could be accused of fraud or something, and you would never know.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parasie said the group plans to launch a crowdfunding campaign on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Homeowners&nbsp;are set to receive more junk mail after the Royal Mail urged businesses to exploit a loophole in new data protection laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Firms across the country have been told they can get round a crackdown on unwanted mail by sending unaddressed letters through the post.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under EU laws coming into force on May 25, businesses must have permission or a legitimate reason to send messages to members of the public. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in recent weeks the Royal Mail has sent out pamphlets reminding businesses &quot;don't forget the power of unaddressed mail&quot; as a way to contact people without needing their personal data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MPs accused the Royal Mail of encouraging junk mail which they described as &quot;frustrating&quot; and &quot;a waste of paper&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The average household&nbsp;already receives around 650 pieces of junk mail a year despite efforts by the Government and regulators to curb the problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Staff at Royal Mail's door-to-door leaflet helpline said there had been an increased demand for their services in recent weeks, with more boxes of leaflets than usual waiting to be distributed to homes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1983 the Mailing Preference Service was established to enable consumers to opt out of receiving&nbsp;junk mail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, households who sign up to the service are still not protected from unaddressed letters, and can expect to receive as many as seven unaddressed leaflets per day&nbsp;from Royal Mail alone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), which is regulating the introduction of co-called &quot;General Data Protection Regulation&quot; (GPDR), also cannot take action against unaddressed mail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a glance | Your data rights</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ian Murray, Labour MP for Edinburgh South, said: &quot;I think the public would be surprised that as a result of tighter and more up-to-date data protection laws they receive even more unwanted junk mail. &nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Individual businesses will determine if this kind of blanket junk mail marketing works but I'm sure most consumers would see it as an unwanted waste of paper.&quot; &nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Julian Knight MP, a member of the digital, culture, media and sport committee, said: &quot;The new rules are about positive consent for how your data is used, so you are always in control of how are you are contacted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In numbers | Royal Mail</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For too long our private personal data has been used for purposes which people haven't consented for, resulting in frustrating amounts of information and junk mail for consumers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Businesses including the Royal Mail should not be trying to find ways around this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consumer groups have also criticised Royal Mail for failing to promote responsible marketing. James Daley, director at consumer group Fairer Finance, said: &quot;It is particularly disappointing to see an organisation that was until recently owned by the Government failing to stick by the spirit of the rules.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;GDPR is being introduced to protect people from spam and unwanted mail. Clearly businesses need to be able to market responsibly, but encouraging unwanted advertising doesn't sound particularly responsible to me. If we can't rely on Royal Mail to lead the way, then we can't expect much of anyone else.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokesman at Royal Mail insisted its door-to-door leaflet service was &quot;valuable&quot;. He said: &quot;We take its responsibility as a media owner very seriously and we comply with relevant advertising laws and regulations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Targeted door-to-door mailings help to underpin the Universal Service. They provide a very valuable service to companies of all kinds as they seek to provide their goods and services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are committed to giving households control over the unaddressed mail they receive so that they can make an informed choice. Royal Mail runs a door-to-door opt-out scheme for unaddressed mail if customers want to stop receiving unaddressed mail.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An ICO spokesman said: &quot;If an organisation is sending mail or leaflets to every address in an area and does not know the identity of the people at those addresses, it is not processing personal data for direct marketing, and the GDPR rules will not apply. However, it may still need to comply with other guidelines and codes on marketing and advertising.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE number of jobs available for lawyers in the UK jumped by nearly a quarter in the first three months of this year as the introduction of new data rules led to a flurry of hiring.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Growth in legal sector jobs - up 23pc compared to the same period last year - was higher than in any other industry in the first quarter, according to professional recruitment firm Robert Walters. This was driven by the impending implementation date for the new General Data Protection Regulation, which is intended to give people more control over their personal data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The changes to the law, which come into force on May 25, mean that companies are increasingly seeking legal advice over what they can and can't do with customers' information, and need help checking whether they risk being in breach of the new rules.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chris Hickey, chief executive of Robert Walters' UK, Middle East and Africa division, said: &quot;GDPR is a high priority for firms across the UK, and legal professionals have subsequently been highly sought after to support firms in adapting to the new guidelines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This demand has applied to both in-house roles and positions within private practice, as smaller businesses engage law firms to support changes to their processes to ensure compliance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As well as GDPR, demand for legal professionals has also been boosted by increased regulation in the financial services sector, especially for lawyers with anti-money laundering and financial crime specialisms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Few legal professionals work in this area, meaning big companies compete for talent. Overall, the number of advertised jobs in the UK rose by 6pc in the first quarter of 2018.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RETAILERS are in their worst shape for nearly five years and the industry's woes look set to deepen in the face of weak demand and soaring costs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The health of the retail industry dropped by one point to 79 during the first quarter, hitting its lowest level since 2013, according to a KPMG/Ipsos Retail Think Tank report.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It marked the second straight quarter of negative growth, as bitter weather conditions, sluggish footfall and rising personal debt among shoppers left the industry licking its wounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A further jump in costs and a failure to recover lost sales are expected to commit the sector to another one-point fall between April and June, the Retail Health Index study found. The dire outlook comes despite the latest official data painting a brighter picture, with retail sales increasing in February after falls in December and January.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paul Martin, the head of retail at KPMG UK, said retailers will have to work &quot;incredibly hard and smart&quot; if they are to entice customers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: &quot;There are some major issues affecting retailers, and those that don't have their houses in order, from the boardroom to the shop floor, will find it hard to survive throughout what are some of the toughest trading conditions for a number of years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Martin added: &quot;There are multiple costs that will pile up in the coming months, including the implementation of the next stage of both the National Living Wage and automatic pension enrolment, last-minute compliance with GDPR regulations, and additional marketing costs to help promote discounts and buy sales.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The drag on the retail industry was largely driven by non-food stores, with grocers enjoying a lift as rising inflation bumped up prices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the group said strengthening wage growth and robust employment would help the industry and prevent demand &quot;falling off a cliff &quot;. There was also hope that the sundrenched start to spring and the Fifa World Cup in the summer could provide some much-needed support to the sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">James Sawley, HSBC's head of retail and leisure, added: &quot;While it is not possible to deny that retailers are finding it incredibly challenging, there are some operators that are seeing their business models flourish.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The discounters, online fashion retailers, food retailers and small, niche retailers are posting strong results and maintaining their margins.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The&nbsp;number of jobs available for &shy;lawyers in the UK jumped by nearly a quarter in the first three months of this year as the introduction of new data rules led to a flurry of hiring.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Growth in legal sector jobs - up 23pc compared to the same period last year - was higher than in any other industry in the first quarter, according to professional recruitment firm Robert Walters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was driven by the impending implementation date for the new &shy;General Data Protection Regulation, which is intended to give people more control over their personal data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The changes to the law, which come into force on May 25, mean that &shy;companies are increasingly seeking &shy;legal advice over what they can and can't do with customers' information, and need help checking whether they risk being in breach of the new rules.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chris Hickey, chief executive of Robert Walters' UK, Middle East and Africa division, said: &quot;GDPR is a high priority for firms across the UK, and legal &shy;professionals have subsequently been highly sought after to support firms in adapting to the new guidelines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This demand has applied to both <SPAN style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&#8232;</SPAN>in-house roles and positions within &shy;private practice, as smaller businesses engage law firms to support changes to their processes to ensure compliance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As well as GDPR, demand for legal professionals has also been boosted by increased regulation in the financial services sector, especially for lawyers with anti-money laundering and financial crime specialisms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Few legal professionals work in this area, meaning big companies compete for talent. Overall, the number of &shy;advertised jobs in the UK rose by 6pc in the first quarter of 2018.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only six in 10 company directors are confident that they will be fully compliant with the new law, according to a survey by the Institute of Directors (IoD).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The European Union's new General Data Protection Regulation comes into effect on May 25, and companies will face stricter rules about how they store and use their customers' data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under GDPR, individuals must opt-in whenever data is collected on them - at the moment many firms only give people the option to opt-out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If businesses fail to comply they would face extra audits and be forced to delete data. Ultimately they could be issued with fines of a maximum of (EURO)20m (&pound;17.6m) or 4pc of their annual turnover, whichever is greater.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jamie Kerr, IoD head of external affairs, warned that some small companies may lack the resources to make sweeping changes.</SPAN></P>

Its bleak landscape and menacing shy might even directly suggest the Russian campaign. At any event, it is a premonitory painting of doom and disaster.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday's World Password Day, an annual PR stunt from Intel, took on unexpected relevance after Twitter asked all of its 336 million users to change their passwords, admitting that a &quot;bug&quot; had left them exposed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Twitter passwords would normally be stored only in encrypted form but the company said yesterday that due to an oversight they had been kept in plain text in an internal log. This would have left them freely accessible to at least some Twitter employees and more vulnerable to external hackers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The microblogging site insisted that it was recommending that users change their passwords only out of an &quot;abundance of caution&quot; due to the company's sense of social responsibility. It said that there was no evidence or indication that passwords had been obtained or misused by hackers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anyone who did obtain those passwords would have gained access to personal data of Twitter users, including a log of their Twitter activity, and the ability to post from their accounts. Because people often use the same password and email address for multiple online services, anyone obtaining the data could have been able to hack people's accounts on other sites.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The failure of Twitter to safeguard its users' data adequately comes after Facebook came under fire for failing to protect the personal information of nearly 90 million people, which was obtained by Cambridge Analytica, the now defunct consultancy accused of electoral meddling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parag Agrawal, Twitter's chief technology officer, tweeted: &quot;We are sharing this information to help people make an informed decision about their account security. We didn't have to, but it's the right thing to do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This prompted one user of the site to comment: &quot;Twitter's CTO is acting like they're doing us a favour by letting us know that Twitter wasn't securely storing our passwords.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a blog post, Mr Agrawal said: &quot;We recognise and appreciate the trust you place in us, and are committed to earning that trust every day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Normally when a user sets a password for a Twitter account, the company uses encryption technology that masks it so that no employee can view it. This also makes it far more difficult for any hackers to access the data in the event of a breach. However, Twitter last night admitted that it had identified &quot;a bug that stored passwords unmasked in an internal log&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokesman added: &quot;We have fixed the bug, and our investigation shows no indication of breach or misuse by anyone. Out of an abundance of caution, we ask that you consider changing your password on all services where you've used this password. You can change your Twitter password any time by going to the password settings page.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: &quot;We found this error ourselves, removed the passwords, and are implementing plans to prevent this bug from happening again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Twitter's embarrassment comes shortly before the implementation of stricter data laws, the general data protection regulation (GDPR), on May 25. The rules will hold companies to higher standards of data protection in the UK and across the European Union, introducing fines of up to (EURO)20 million or 4 per cent of global turnover.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook, which has been heavily criticised by politicians for its failure to protect users' data, has fired an employee who was abusing his access to internal Facebook data to &quot;stalk&quot; a woman who he was speaking to on the dating app Tinder. A spokesman said yesterday that the employee had been sacked immediately after his activities were discovered.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FACEBOOK recently found itself up to its neck in the Cambridge Analytica scandal, with boss Mark Zuckerberg ending up in front of US lawmakers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the centre of it all was misuse of people's personal data and invasions of privacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in weeks the whole personal data game will change with a new piece of legislation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The General Data Protection Regulation comes into force in Europe on May 25 and confusing emails about it are already filling inboxes nationwide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GDPR affects any company or organisation which processes the data of any EU citizen and applies whether or not that company is based in the EU. So this means Google and Facebook, too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And it is unaffected by Brexit - the Government is implementing the Data Protection Bill, which largely mirrors the GDPR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the law is large and complex, importantly it gives individuals more rights to information held about them, as well as control over how their data is used.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here is everything you need to know about the GDPR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Who does the GDPR affect?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Practically everyone. If you have signed up to any kind of online service, whether it is a Clubcard from Tesco or a Gmail account from Google, you will be covered by the new legislation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only people whose data it does not cover are the deceased.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is not just about being online, either. People who do not use the internet are still covered as their data may be processed so they can receive letters or magazine subscriptions through the post.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Furthermore, if you are an employee, you will have certain rights because the company you work for is processing your data in order to pay your salary, provide you with equipment or know where you are during work hours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Any firm with employees will have to make them aware of when and how their data is being used.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What does it mean for me?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First, you can expect to be told more about how your data is being used. Second, you can request access to it and ask for copies of it, or have the entire process stopped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What's more, firms have to be clear and transparent about everything, which is why you might be getting a flurry of emails asking you to tick boxes to give your consent for use of your data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You may also see new icons pop up on your mobile phone to indicate that you are agreeing something will need to process data, such as your email address, phone number or even your location.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, on an iPhone, you will now see a small blue icon of two people shaking hands; Apple's way of telling you a feature needs access to your information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why is it so serious?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Part of the reason companies are taking such notice of GDPR is that the fines involved for noncompliance are gigantic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the most serious breaches, regulators will be able to issue penalties equivalent to up to 4% of annual global turnover or (EURO)20million; whichever is greater. For giant companies, these fines could run into hundreds of millions of pounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Will it make a difference</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It already appears to be. Many large technology and internet companies have begun the process of making their data practices more transparent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Facebook and Twitter have been rolling out updates to their privacy policies, adding clearer language and description of data use and offering more tools to users to share or remove their personal data from that platform.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you start receiving letters from companies asking for your consent to continue doing the things they were doing before, that is the GDPR at work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just make sure you decide if you want them to continue or not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Should you care about the changes?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, you should. Increasingly your personal data is the currency that fuels the online world. The more control you have over it, the better.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As part of the new laws, companies must give users greater access to controls around what data they share and want to keep private.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook, for example, is rolling out a tool that enables users to opt-in to facial recognition being used to scan their photos, but also the chance to switch it off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And, fanfare, you are now able to reject or opt out of things such as direct marketing at any point, so it is the perfect time to finally stop all those spam messages.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have standards and indepen&shy; dent bodies who make sure they are met. The GDPR calls for wider use of privacy seals, but does not require them. This involves an independent body checking that the way firms deal with our data meets standards.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The European data protection supervisor has hit out at social media and tech firms over the recent constant stream of privacy policy emails in the run up to GDPR, calling them them the &quot;sweatshops of the connected world&quot;. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the tough new General Data Protection Regulations coming into force on 25 May, companies around the world are being forced to notify their users to accept new privacy policies and data processing terms to continue to use the services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Giovanni Buttarelli, the European data protection supervisor (EDPS), lambasted the often-hostile approach of the recent deluge of notifications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If this encounter seems a take-it-or-leave it proposition - with perhaps a hint of menace - then it is a travesty of at least the spirit of the new regulation, which aims to restore a sense of trust and control over what happens to our online lives,&quot; said Buttarelli. &quot;Consent cannot be freely given if the provision of a service is made conditional on processing personal data not necessary for the performance of a contract.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The most recent [Facebook] scandal has served to expose a broken and unbalanced ecosystem reliant on unscrupulous personal data collection and micro-targeting for whatever purposes promise to generate clicks and revenues. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The digital information ecosystem farms people for their attention, ideas and data in exchange for so called 'free' services. Unlike their analogue equivalents, these sweatshops of the connected world extract more than one's labour, and while clocking into the online factory is effortless it is often impossible to clock off.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While data protection and privacy has become a hot-button issue in part thanks to the Cambridge Analytica files, Buttarelli is concerned that it is simply being used as part of the &quot;PR toolkit&quot; of firms. He said that there is &quot;a growing gulf between hyperbole and reality, where controllers learn to talk a good game while continuing with the same old harmful habits&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A new social media subgroup of data protection regulators will be convened in mid-May to tackle what Buttarelli called the &quot;manipulative approaches&quot; that must change with GDPR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Brilliant lawyers will always be able to fashion ingenious arguments to justify almost any practice. But with personal data processing we need to move to a different model,&quot; said Buttarelli. &quot;The old approach is broken and unsustainable - that will be, in my view, the abiding lesson of the Facebook/ Cambridge Analytica case.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The division list for the Commons vote on the Windrush scandal (see: 7.20pm ) showed 180 of Labour's 258 MPs voting in favour, with a further two of its MPs acting as tellers for the ayes. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The remainder of those who voted in favour included 28 SNP MPs, five Liberal Democrats, four Plaid Cymru, the Green Party's MP Caroline Lucas, and the independent MPs Kelvin Hopkins, Ivan Lewis and Jared O'Mara.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The list also showed 306 of the Conservative Party's 316 MPs voted against the motion, with a further two of its MPs acting as tellers for the noes. Nine DUP MPs and the independent, Charlie Elphicke, also opposed the motion.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MPs reject Labour's Windrush disclosure motion  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government has survived the motion - MPs have voted down Labour's motion to force ministers to disclose eight years of internal documents and correspondence about the Windrush scandal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government imposed a three-line whip on Tory MPs to vote against and won by 316 votes to 221 - a majority of 95. Responding to the defeat, Labour's shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, said:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was an opportunity for the Tories to start to right the wrongs they have done to the Windrush generation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After losing her human shield with the resignation of Amber Rudd, the architect of this scandal, Theresa May, ordered her MPs to vote to cover up the truth of her involvement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is nothing short of a betrayal of the Windrush generation and others who have been affected by the government's heartless 'hostile environment', and flies in the face of the new home secretary's promise to make things right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tory MPs will now have to explain to the people whose lives have been turned upside down why they think they don't deserve the facts to be known and don't deserve proper justice.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ill-conceived compromises and unrealistic technological solutions are simply not good enough. The government's failure to act is holding back the Brexit negotiations and creating deep uncertainty for communities in Northern Ireland.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The House of Lords has backed a move to prevent a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, delivering a 10th defeat to the government on its flagship Brexit legislation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Voting was 309 to 242, a majority of 67, for a cross-party amendment to the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill also enshrining support for the Good Friday peace agreement and continued &quot;North-South&quot; cooperation. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ministers delay customs plan decision after failing to reach agreement  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While peers vote, it has been announced that a decision on the UK's customs arrangements after Brexit has been put off after a crunch meeting of senior ministers failed to reach agreement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prime minister, Theresa May, asked officials to draw up &quot;revised proposals&quot; after the government was unable to unite behind one of the two options on the table - both of which have already been dismissed as &quot;unworkable&quot; by EU officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Downing Street sources said ministers in May's &quot;Brexit war cabinet&quot; recognised there were &quot;challenges&quot; with both of the proposed solutions, which were first put forward last summer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Brexit negotiator Olly Robbins and his team are expected to come forward with amended proposals swiftly so that ministers can arrive at a preferred option possibly as early as next week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new cabinet members, Sajid Javid and Gavin Williamson, both came out in the meeting against the &quot;customs partnership&quot; model, under which the UK would collect tariffs on behalf of the EU.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their opposition came after eurosceptic Tory backbenchers signalled that they regarded the partnership plan - branded &quot;cretinous&quot; by Jacob Rees-Mogg - unacceptable because he believed it would deliver Brexit in name only.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Referring to Lord Bridges's speech (see 5.46pm), he says he would not have signed an agreement in December that could lead to the creation of a border in the North Sea. As a former Hong Kong governor, he knows enough about one country, two systems.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the Lords debate Lord Bridges, the remain voter who served as a Brexit minister until the general election, said he would be supporting the government and voting against the Patten amendment. He said parliament had to give the government space to negotiate, and to allow it to make compromises. But he did not sound positive about the Brexit talks process. He told peers:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My fear is that, come the autumn, the agreement on the future arrangements will be fudge. But it cannot be fudge containing the poison pill of that backstop. People voted to leave the European Union. They did not vote to break up the union that underpins our nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So the double think of the December agreement, in which paragraph 49 says one thing and paragraph 50 another, cannot be allowed to seep into the final agreement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bridges said, if peers wanted to take a stand about the Brexit withdrawal agreement because of its provisions for Ireland, the time to do that would be at the end of the process.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back in the House of Commons the Labour MP David Lammy was applauded as he likened the Home Office's &quot;compliant environment&quot; to slavery. Lammy, whose father came to Britain from Guyana in 1956 and who has been a leading campaigner on behalf of the Windrush migrants, compliance was &quot;written deep into our souls and passed down from our ancestors&quot;. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Referring to the way the new home secretary Sajid Javid prefers the term &quot;compliant&quot; to &quot;hostile&quot; to describe that way the government wants to create an environment that discourages illegal immigration, he said: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On behalf of the Windrush generation, keep in mind that spiritual, let freedom reign: it will only reign when this country turns back from the path it's on, ends the compliant environment in which I know my place, and starts along a humane path that at its heart has human rights...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Windrush generation are here because of slavery. The Windrush story is a story of British empire and the Windrush community and its ancestors know what hostile and compliance means.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We know what compliance means: it's written deep into our souls and passed down from our ancestors. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Slaves having to nod and smile when they were being whipped in a cotton field or a sugarcane field were compliant. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Watching your partner being tied to a tree, beaten or raped on a plantation, is compliance. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Twelve million people being transported as slaves from Africa to the colonies is a compliant environment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chris Patten warns peers about impact of 'clueless, delinquent' Brexit policy on Northern Ireland  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the House of Lords peers are debating the EU withdrawal bill again. We are expecting another vote, and another government defeat, on an amendment tabled by Chris Patten, the Conservative former cabinet minister and former European commissioner (and head of an inquiry into policing in Northern Ireland in the 1990s). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Patten's amendment, amendment 88, would prevent the government implementing Brexit in a way that undermined the Good Friday agreement or led to a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opening the debate, Patten said that what he was asking for was in line with stated government policy. But he explained why he thought his amendment needed to be written into law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are a number of members of the Conservative party in another place [the Commons] who are very keen for the over the cliff, onto the rocks Brexit and I think are making life rather more difficult for the prime minister to square circles than should be the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of his speeech was about the importance of the Good Friday agreement. Here are some extracts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the government say in their position paper, the issue of identity goes to the heart of the Good Friday agreement. And anybody who doubts that that's the case should look at curbstones, should consider flags. In 2012 the city council in Belfast decided it wanted to reduce the number of times during the year that the union flag was flown. Result: a year of demonstrations and civil disorder, 130 police officers injured, a political office firebombed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ask yourself this question. Why is the Northern Ireland not working at the moment? Because of an article about identity, because of an argument about parity of esteem for different cultures and different loyalties. That is why it is not working.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The genius of the Good Friday agreement was to extract from nationalists the commitment that they would only ask for change constitutionally in Northern Ireland if it was the process of democracy. And on the other hand they were told they didn't have to sign up to being loyal to all the usual symbols of what they regarded as the unionist state. It hasn't meant that everyone is loving one another to bits. But it has ended the violence. Violence which saw the deaths of a thousand police officers and soldiers during the Troubles, twice as many as died in Iraq or Afghanistan...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was a suggestion in the debate on the customs union that this House, by talking about that, by talking about the border and so on, was playing with fire. [Patten is referring to a speech by his Tory colleague Michael Forsyth.] I'll tell you what I think playing with fire is. I think playing with fire is blundering into the politics of Northern Ireland with a policy that is sometimes clueless, and sometimes delinquent, with a can of petrol and a box of matches in the other hand. I think that's playing with fire. I think that's what we're really in danger of doing...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I don't want to go back to the old triumphs, the old humiliations, the old animosities, the old feuds. I think it would be shameful, shameful and dishonourable, if this House was do to anything that made this more likely. I think it would be a stain on our history.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is what Theresa May  said at PMQs earlier when she announced an inquiry into the Windrush scandal. She told MPs:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We all share the ambition to make sure we do right by members of the Windrush generation, which is why [Sajid Javid] will be announcing a package of measures to bring transparency on the issue, to make sure that the House is informed, and to reassure members of this House but, more importantly, to reassure those people who have been directly affected. Speed is of the essence and [Javid] will be commissioning a full review of lessons learned, independent oversight and external challenge, with the intention of reporting back to this House before we rise for the summer. The review will have full access to all relevant information in the Home Office, including policy papers and casework decisions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ashworth welcomed Hunt's &quot;candour&quot; in questioning why the problem was not picked up. He went on:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eight years is a long time for an error of this magnitude to go undetected. Did the department receive any warnings in that time, is there any record of how many women raised concerns that they had not received appropriate screening, were there any opportunities to change this mistake which were missed?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hunt said:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The existence of a potential issue was brought to the attention of the Department of Health and Social Care by Public Health England in January, although at that stage their advice was that the risk to patients was limited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An urgent clinical evaluation took place and the matter was &quot;escalated to ministers&quot; in March this year by PHE &quot;with clear clinical advice that the matter should not be made public&quot;. That was so a plan could be put in place first to ensure &quot;any remedies did not overwhelm the existing screening programme&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's very concerning to learn that so many women have not received an invitation to screening over a prolonged period of time. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We know this may leave many women with questions about breast screening. If you suspect you have been directly affected by this or if you are over 50 and haven't had a mammogram in the last three years and would like one, the NHS Choices website provides further information and the option to contact your local unit to book an appointment. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's worth remembering that many breast cancers are still found by women themselves, outside of the screening programme, so if you notice any unusual changes in your breast, see your GP straight away.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What Hunt told MPs - Extract  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here is an extract from Jeremy Hunt's statement to MPs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier this year PHE [Public Health England] analysis of trial data from the service found that there was a computer algorithm failure dating back to 2009. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest estimates I have received from PHE is that as a result of this, between 2009 and the start of 2018, an estimated 450,000 women aged between 68 and 71 were not invited to their final breast screening. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At this stage it is not clear whether any delay in diagnosis resulted in any avoidable harm or death and that is one of the reasons I am ordering an independent review to establish the clinical impact.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our current best estimate which comes with caveats as it's based on statistical modelling rather than patient reviews, and because there is currently no clinical consensus about the benefits of screening for this age group, is that there may be between 135 and 270 women who had their lives shortened as a result. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am advised that it is unlikely to be more than this range and may be considerably less. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, tragically there are likely to be some people in this group who would have been alive today if the failure had not happened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">block-time published-time 1.16pm BST </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Labour  Paul Williams, a GP, asks if the update of screening of 68 to 71-year-olds during this period was less than expected. And, if so, why was that not investigated?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hunt says he will look into this. He does not know if there was a lower uptake. Normally the screening uptake rate is 80%, he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">block-time published-time 1.14pm BST </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Philippa Whitford, the SN's health spokeswoman and a breast surgeon, says she is concerned about Hunt's suggestion that, with older women, early diagnosis does not matter so much. She says early diagnosis is always important.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She asks what efforts have been made to track down women affected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hunt says he does not think he did say that you do not need to diagnose early. What he was saying was that, in many cases, early diagnosis will not make a difference. But diagnosis is always important, he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">block-time published-time 1.08pm BST </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sarah Wollaston,  the Conservative MP and GP who chairs the Commons health committee, says the woman affected need consistent, evidence-based guidance as to what they should do next.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hunt says the government has to be clear with patients that there is no medical consensus about the efficacy of screening for patients in the 70s. But anyone who wants a scan will get a scan, he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">block-time published-time 1.05pm BST </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hunt says there is no consensus about the efficacy of breast cancer screening for older women. That is because older women are more likely to develop cancers, but those cancers are less likely to be life threatening, he says.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Up to 270 women may have died because of major breast screening programme failure, MPs told  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hunt says he wasnts to inform MPs of &quot;a serious failure that has come to light&quot; in the breast cancer screening programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some 2m women get screened every year, he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier this year it was found that a computer algorithm problem meant that between 2009 and the start of 2018 some 450,000 women aged between 68 and 71 were not invited to their final screening.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> PMQs - Snap verdict: That wasn't really a PMQs at all; we just had two PPBs (party political broadcasts) blaring away in tandem, doing little to enlighten anyone. Corbyn's PPB was better on passion, and it covered wider ground - in fact, there was little area of public policy where he failed to castigate the government - but May probably did better on specific, memorable detail (her Hazelbourne Road anecdote). The local elections take place tomorrow, and so perhaps this wasn't surprising. Corbyn did start with a neat, sassy question about Windrush. But May's announcement about an inquiry into what went wrong disarmed him, and also helped to explain why the Tory whips feel comfortable about ordering their MPs to vote against the Labour motion calling for all confidential government paperwork on Windrush to be disclosed later this afternoon. The government clearly feels that this will be enough to contain demands for the full disclosure of documents, although the inquiry she announced sounded very minimalist. She described it as a &quot;full review of lessons learned&quot; rather than a proper inquiry, and it does not sound as if it will be especially independent. (She talked about &quot;independent oversight and external challenge&quot;, which is not quite the same as having an independent person in charge.) It will also concluded before the end of July, which means it may be one of the shortest inquiries on record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">block-time published-time 12.19pm BST </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Corbyn says the education secretary has been corrected by the UK Statistics Authority. It says budgets are being cut. Yet May is in denial. And police budgets are an issue too. Home Office civil servants says there is a link between budget cuts and increased crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">May says she has protected police budgets. That is not what Andy Burnham proposed when he was shadow home secretary. She says the shadow home affairs minister has said there is no relationship between police numbers and crime figures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Corbyn says the shadow police minister was pointing to a cut in police budgets. Some 21,000 police officers have lost their jobs since 2010. Violent crime is rising. Deaths from knife crime are going up, especially in London. The government is making a complete shambles of Brexit, damaging the NHS, damaging schools, and yet they claim to be strong and stable. With council tax rising by more than 5% all over the country, isn't the truth that with the Tories you pay more and get less.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">May says there is more funding going into the NHS, schools and social care. If Corbyn wants to talk about council tax, he should go to Hazelbourne Road in Clapham. On one side houses in Labour Lambeth people pay very high council tax. On the other side, in Conservative Wandworth, people pay much less. That shows people pay less under the Conservatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">block-time published-time 12.14pm BST </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Corbyn offers facts about the inquiry. There are more people in debt, more people using food banks, more people in debt and more people in poverty. The NHS is suffering the longest funding squeeze in history. Will May apologise for this?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">May says there are more people in work, and fewer people in absolute poverty. She says the chancellor has announced &pound;10bn extra for the NHS. She is conducting a review to find a long-term plan. That is the sensible approach to take. It is about funding and reform.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Corbyn says March was the worst month on record for A&amp;E. It was also the worst month for cancelled operation. There are thousands of vacancies for NHS staff. But May intervened personally to stop the NHS hiring from abroad. He says the education secretary used to say there would be no cut in schools funding. Last week he refused to repeat that pledge. Will May admit schools budgets are being cut?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">May says there is more money for schools. It is not just a question of how much money you put in. She says 1.9m children are in outstanding schools under this government.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3 - Our trade partners would be deterred from agreeing mutual tariff reductions by their having to pay EU tariff rates up front. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4 - The UK would have less negotiating leverage over a potential trade partner's trade barriers and behind the border regulatory barriers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5 - EU quotas make the problem yet more complex.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6 - Only large corporates would be able to carry the significant administrative burdens of this system. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7 - Crucially, this option also frustrates UK regulatory independence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8 - If the above factors mean that uptake of the rebate scheme is low, this would mean that the tariffs levied in practice on goods entering the UK market could be higher than the UK's bound rate, which would be a violation of the GATT. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9 - The UK would continue to be a substantial tax collector for the EU, continuing to make a substantial net contribution to the EU budget.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And here is an extract from the conclusion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NCP proposed is undeliverable in operational terms and would require a degree of regulatory alignment that would make the execution of an independent trade policy a practical impossibility. This covers not only our external trade agenda but our own control over UK regulation and whether we can improve it. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Economists have recently described a &quot;new normal&quot; of limited global growth, potentially secular global stagnation. This can be avoided by a group of countries committing to reduce the distortions found in anticompetitive regulation. For example, a 20% reduction in distortions in the TPP 11, plus the UK and US, over 15 years could yield approximately an added 0.5% into global GDP year-on-year (c.$2 trillion over the period), according to some estimates. Set against this, customs clearance costs are small. (It should be noted that the estimates of the impact of behind the border barrier reduction are conservative, ignoring distortion reductions elsewhere, for example in China, that this approach may yield, nor do they assume any interaction effects.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Any form of the customs arrangements above would mean continuing curtailment of UK capacity for independent trade and self-government, plus ECJ jurisdiction, applying harmonised rules and regulations across the domestic UK economy; they also mean external tariffs and abiding by future changes, but without a vote. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Labour accuses May of orchestrating 'cover up' over Windrush scandal  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Labour has accused the government of a cover up and of shedding &quot;crocodile tears&quot; over Windrush in the light of its decision to whip its MPs to vote against the opposition day motion. A Labour spokesperson said:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the architect of this cruel farce, the prime minister, is ordering her MPs to vote to keep her role in this mess hidden from the public, it exposes the Tories' crocodile tears on the Windrush scandal as a sham.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We need answers, not further cover ups to save Theresa May from facing up to her involvement in the removal of rights, detentions and possible deportations of British citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After letting Rudd take the fall for her decisions, how can the public have any trust in the prime minister?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are likely to hear much more of this at PMQs in an hour's time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">block-time published-time 10.51am BST </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tory MPs ordered to vote against Labour motion calling for release of confidential government Windrush papers  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conservative MPs are being whipped to vote against the Labour opposition day motion saying the government should publish papers, correspondence and advice on Windrush between ministers, senior officials and advisors from May 2010 until now, we've been told. That means there will be a vote at 7pm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until now the government has tended not to vote against opposition day motions. Generally they are not binding on the government, and ministers found it easier to ignore motions they did not like than to run the risk of staging a vote and losing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That led to the Labour party using their opposition days to table &quot;humble address&quot; motions demanding the release of particular government papers to select committees. These motions, which used to be used very rarely, are binding on the government. Last year there were motions ordering the release of the government's Brexit impact assessments and of universal credit project assessments. Both were passed without opposition because the government did not order its MPs to vote against. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today the whips are taking a different approach and are instructing their MPs to vote against the Labour motion. Why? Presumably because they are reasonably confident of winning. The Labour motion is very wide-ranging, because it requires all internal government documents, including emails and text messages, relating to Windrush-related policy decisions to be handed over to the Commons home affairs committee (which would then be free to publish the material). Many MPs might argue that that is unreasonable, because even under the Freedom of Information Act there is an acceptance that government decision making is protected by some degree of confidentiality. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the key point is that the motion seems to have been drafted with the express intent of uncovering material likely to embarrass Theresa May and establish her culpability in the Windrush affair. Many Tory MPs are embarrassed about Windrush, but at some point tribal loyalty kicks in and they would have to feel very strongly about this to vote for something so nakedly hostile to their party leader.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So the Tories may well win. But it won't look good, because it will look like a cover-up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For reference, here is the wording of the motion in full.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That an humble address be presented to Her Majesty, that she will be graciously pleased to give directions that the following papers be provided to the home affairs committee: all papers, correspondence and advice including emails and text messages, from 11 May 2010 up to and including 1 May 2018, to and between ministers, senior officials and special advisers relating to policy decisions including on the Immigration Acts 2014 and 2016 with regard the Windrush generation cases, including deportations, detentions and refusal of re-entry, the setting of deportation and removal targets and their effect on the Windrush generation, and action taken within government following the concerns raised by Caribbean governments with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office including the original decision by the prime minister not to meet Caribbean heads of government and officials, and all copies of minutes and papers relating to the cabinet's immigration implementation taskforce.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lidington says cabinet expected to take customs decision not today but 'over next few weeks'  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his interview on the Today programme David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister, confirmed what the Guardian reported overnight - that today's meeting of the key Brexit cabinet sub committee is not expected to take a decision today as to whether the &quot;customs partnership&quot; or the alternative &quot;highly streamlined customs arrangement&quot; (which is now being referred to as &quot;maximum facilitation&quot;, or &quot;max fac&quot;, in Whitehall). He said the committee's discussions would &quot;start this afternoon and will probably continue in other meetings&quot;. He went on:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This will be the first time today for cabinet colleagues to sit down and have a constructive discussion about the way forward. I expect we will come to a decision on this, as well as on other important elements of our negotiating position, over the next few weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For reference, this is what the government's future partnership paper (pdf) on customs published last summer said about the two options.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government believes that there are two broad approaches the UK could adopt to meet these objectives. These approaches represent different choices about the nature of our relationship with the EU and countries around the world, but in either option the UK would seek to pursue its independent trade policy objectives.</SPAN></P>

<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A highly streamlined customs arrangement between the UK and the EU, streamlining and simplifying requirements, leaving as few additional requirements on EU trade as possible. This would aim to: continue some of the existing arrangements between the UK and the EU; put in place new negotiated and potentially unilateral facilitations to reduce and remove barriers to trade; and implement technology-based solutions to make it easier to comply with customs procedures. This approach involves utilising the UK's existing tried and trusted third country processes for UK-EU trade, building on EU and international precedents, and developing new innovative facilitations to deliver as frictionless a customs border as possible.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A new customs partnership with the EU, aligning our approach to the customs border in a way that removes the need for a UK-EU customs border. One potential approach would involve the UK mirroring the EU's requirements for imports from the rest of the world where their final destination is the EU. This is of course unprecedented as an approach and could be challenging to implement and we will look to explore the principles of this with business and the EU.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Theresa May has opened talks with Brussels on the UK's future relationship with the EU after Brexit. But any negotiation with Michel Barnier can't really match, in terms of the strength of passion engaged, or the risk it poses to her own premiership, the negotiation she is having to conduct simultaneously with her own backbenchers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And today that negotiation has hit a crisis point. The European Research Group (ERG), which is led by Jacob Rees-Mogg and represents around 50 Tory backbenchers committed to a harder form of Brexit, has sent her a long report arguing that the &quot;customs partnership&quot; proposals - one of the government's two post-Brexit customs options for when the UK leaves the EU, and one that May is reluctant to drop - is unacceptable. The Daily Telegraph and the Daily Mail are both leading with the story.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the peculiarities of this is that, when the government first floated the customs partnership idea in a policy paper last summer (pdf), the Brexiters did not complain about it at all. But now, in leave circles, it is being vilified as being almost equivalent to remaining in the EU. Here is an extract from the Telegraph splash (paywall).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One ERG source said: &quot;We have swallowed everything so far - but this is it. If they don't have confidence in Brexit we don't have confidence in them. The prime minister will not have a majority if she does not kill off the NCP [New Customs Partnership].&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Rees-Mogg added: &quot;The customs partnership is incompatible with the Conservative party manifesto.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A copy of the report, obtained by The Daily Telegraph, dismantles the argument for a customs partnership which Brexiteers fear will keep Britain effectively in a customs union with the European Union after the UK leaves in March next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rees-Mogg got the 8.10am slot on the Today programme to discuss this further (a sign of the influence he exerts on the government - David Lidington, who is supposedly May's effective deputy prime minister, was relegated to the less prestigious 8.40 slot). And Rees-Mogg insisted that the the ERG were not threatening to bring down the prime minister over this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no question of there being an ultimatum. This is a paper that has been produced on a specific aspect of policy that would not work, that would not effectively take us out of the European Union. It would leave us de facto in both the customs union and the single market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At this point he sounded not entirely unlike someone running a protection racket. &quot;Very nice majority you've got here, prime minister. Great shame if anything were to happen to it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later he claimed that the ERG was actually doing May a favour. When it was put to him that his stance was damaging her negotiating position, he replied:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I don't think it does, actually, because there is no point in negotiating with something that the other side think is magical thinking. The sooner the government gets away from this customs partnership, the easier it will be to get onto a negotiating that might actually happen.</SPAN></P>

Chris Patten, the Conservative former chairman, told peers that Brexiters in his party are &quot;playing with fire&quot; and pursuing a policy in Northern Ireland &quot;that is sometimes clueless, and sometimes delinquent&quot;. (See 4.59am.) The Brexit war cabinet delayed a decision on the UK's customs arrangements after failing to reach agreement in a crunch meeting. The prime minister asked officials to draw up &quot;revised proposals&quot; for minister to consider again. MPs voted down a Labour attempt to gain access to documents detailing the Windrush crisis after Theresa May promised the government would review the decisions leading to it. Labour's shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, said it was &quot;nothing short of a betrayal of the Windrush generation&quot;. Women's lives may have been cut short by a major IT error which meant 450,000 patients in England missed crucial breast cancer screenings, the health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, has said. Theresa May believes the latest bullying allegations against the Speaker of the House of Commons are concerning, and should be properly investigated, her spokesman has said. The Cayman Islands government said it was considering legal action in an attempt to stop the UK making the overseas territory open up its company ownership registers to public scrutiny, a day after MPs agreed they should do so by the end of 2020. This live blog is now closing down. In the Lords vote (see: 7.02pm), an analysis of the division list showed 19 Tory rebels backed the amendment, voting against the government. They included the former deputy prime minister, Michael Heseltine, and the former ministers, David Willetts, Douglas Hogg and Ros Altmann. The division list for the Commons vote on the Windrush scandal (see: 7.20pm) showed 180 of Labour's 258 MPs voting in favour, with a further two of its MPs acting as tellers for the ayes. The remainder of those who voted in favour included 28 SNP MPs, five Liberal Democrats, four Plaid Cymru, the Green Party's MP Caroline Lucas, and the independent MPs Kelvin Hopkins, Ivan Lewis and Jared O'Mara. The list also showed 306 of the Conservative Party's 316 MPs voted against the motion, with a further two of its MPs acting as tellers for the noes. Nine DUP MPs and the independent, Charlie Elphicke, also opposed the motion. Reacting to the government's defeat over the EU withdrawal bill in the Lords (see: 7.02pm), the Liberal Democrat leader in the upper house, Lord Newby, said: This vote has recognised what Theresa May hasn't: that the issue of the Northern Ireland border is of paramount importance. We cannot risk Conservative incompetence and Brexit dogma creating a hard border, and we will not allow years of strong relations within these islands to be jeopardised by Brexit. The government has survived the motion - MPs have voted down Labour's motion to force ministers to disclose eight years of internal documents and correspondence about the Windrush scandal. The government imposed a three-line whip on Tory MPs to vote against and won by 316 votes to 221 - a majority of 95. Responding to the defeat, Labour's shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, said: This was an opportunity for the Tories to start to right the wrongs they have done to the Windrush generation. After losing her human shield with the resignation of Amber Rudd, the architect of this scandal, Theresa May, ordered her MPs to vote to cover up the truth of her involvement. This is nothing short of a betrayal of the Windrush generation and others who have been affected by the government's heartless 'hostile environment', and flies in the face of the new home secretary's promise to make things right. Tory MPs will now have to explain to the people whose lives have been turned upside down why they think they don't deserve the facts to be known and don't deserve proper justice. In the Commons, MPs are voting on Labour's opposition day motion demanding the government release documents related to the treatment of the Windrush generation, with a result expected in a few minutes. Ministers have imposed a three-line whip on Conservative MPs to try to defeat the measure, which represents a change from recent Tory policy of not taking part in votes on opposition day motions. Responding to the government's defeat in the Lords (see: 7.02pm), Labour's shadow Brexit minister, Jenny Chapman, said: This vote sends a clear signal to the government that they must urgently find a solution to the Northern Ireland border. Ill-conceived compromises and unrealistic technological solutions are simply not good enough. The government's failure to act is holding back the Brexit negotiations and creating deep uncertainty for communities in Northern Ireland. Ministers should back this amendment and accept Labour's call for a new comprehensive customs union with the EU. The House of Lords has backed a move to prevent a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, delivering a 10th defeat to the government on its flagship Brexit legislation. Voting was 309 to 242, a majority of 67, for a cross-party amendment to the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill also enshrining support for the Good Friday peace agreement and continued &quot;North-South&quot; cooperation. While peers vote, it has been announced that a decision on the UK's customs arrangements after Brexit has been put off after a crunch meeting of senior ministers failed to reach agreement. The prime minister, Theresa May, asked officials to draw up &quot;revised proposals&quot; after the government was unable to unite behind one of the two options on the table - both of which have already been dismissed as &quot;unworkable&quot; by EU officials. Downing Street sources said ministers in May's &quot;Brexit war cabinet&quot; recognised there were &quot;challenges&quot; with both of the proposed solutions, which were first put forward last summer. The Brexit negotiator Olly Robbins and his team are expected to come forward with amended proposals swiftly so that ministers can arrive at a preferred option possibly as early as next week. The new cabinet members, Sajid Javid and Gavin Williamson, both came out in the meeting against the &quot;customs partnership&quot; model, under which the UK would collect tariffs on behalf of the EU. Their opposition came after eurosceptic Tory backbenchers signalled that they regarded the partnership plan - branded &quot;cretinous&quot; by Jacob Rees-Mogg - unacceptable because he believed it would deliver Brexit in name only. Chris Patten is now concluding the Lords debate. He says invites Lord Duncan, the minister, to join him later on in voting for the government's policy (a joke about how his amendment, which the government is opposing, is nominally just a statement of government policy). Referring to Lord Bridges's speech (see 5.46pm), he says he would not have signed an agreement in December that could lead to the creation of a border in the North Sea. As a former Hong Kong governor, he knows enough about one country, two systems. He calls for a vote. And now peers are voting on the amendment. At this point I'm handing over to my colleague Kevin Rawlinson. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland's first minister, has been reading Laura Kuenssberg's tweets. (See 6.28pm.) On the basis of what she's read, Sturgeon says government Brexit policy is &quot;an utter shambles&quot;. Back in the Lords Duncan is coming to the end of his speech. He says the government is firmly committed to the Good Friday agreement. It is entrenched in nine pieces of primary legislation, he says. But he says the political language in the second half of the amendment is not acceptable to the government. That does not mean the government is not committed to the Good Friday agreement, he says. Turning away from the House of Lords debate for a moment, here is some more on the cabinet sub committee meeting on customs. From the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg From ITV's Robert Peston From the Sun's Harry Cole Duncan admits that much of what is in the Patten amendment reflects government policy. But the language is political, he says, particularly towards the end of the amendment. He says it is not the language of legislation. It will be for the government to write legislation when the withdrawal agreement is finalised. The text of the amendment, amendment 88, is in this document (pdf). In the Lords Lord Duncan of Springbank, a minister in the Northern Ireland Office and the Scotland Office, is now winding up for the government. He says the government is clear; it will not allow a border to be put in place in the North Sea. He says Michel Barnier, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, said some red lines might have to be adjusted. But that is not the case in Ireland, he says. He says Barnier should listen to both communities in Northern Ireland. In the Lords debate Paul Murphy, the former Labour Northern Ireland secretary, is winding up for the opposition. He says all sides in Ireland want to avoid the return of a hard border. All the amendment is doing is providing for what everyone wants, he says. Chris Patten, the Conservative former chairman, has told the House of Lords that Brexiters in his party are &quot;playing with fire&quot; and pursuing a policy in Northern Ireland &quot;that is sometimes clueless, and sometimes delinquent&quot;. (See 4.59am.) He was speaking at the start of a debate on an amendment to the EU withdrawal bill he has tabled that would prevent the government implementing Brexit in a way that undermined the Good Friday agreement or led to a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic. The government is expected to lose when the amendment gets put to a vote, probably within the next half an hour. We will be covering the result. The government will review the decisions leading to the Windrush crisis, Theresa May has said, in an announcement intended to head off a Labour attempt to seek access to documents detailing the process. MPs are still debating the Labour motion, which will be put to a vote at 7pm. We will be covering that result too. Women's lives may have been cut short by a major IT error which meant 450,000 patients in England missed crucial breast cancer screenings, the health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, has said. Theresa May believes the latest bullying allegations against the Speaker of the House of Commons are concerning, and should be properly investigated, her spokesman has said. The Cayman Islands government said it was considering legal action in an attempt to stop the UK making the overseas territory open up its company ownership registers to public scrutiny, a day after MPs agreed they should do so by the end of 2020. In the Lords debate Lord Bridges, the remain voter who served as a Brexit minister until the general election, said he would be supporting the government and voting against the Patten amendment. He said parliament had to give the government space to negotiate, and to allow it to make compromises. But he did not sound positive about the Brexit talks process. He told peers: My fear is that, come the autumn, the agreement on the future arrangements will be fudge. But it cannot be fudge containing the poison pill of that backstop. People voted to leave the European Union. They did not vote to break up the union that underpins our nation. So the double think of the December agreement, in which paragraph 49 says one thing and paragraph 50 another, cannot be allowed to seep into the final agreement. Bridges said, if peers wanted to take a stand about the Brexit withdrawal agreement because of its provisions for Ireland, the time to do that would be at the end of the process. Back in the House of Commons the Labour MP David Lammy was applauded as he likened the Home Office's &quot;compliant environment&quot; to slavery. Lammy, whose father came to Britain from Guyana in 1956 and who has been a leading campaigner on behalf of the Windrush migrants, compliance was &quot;written deep into our souls and passed down from our ancestors&quot;. Referring to the way the new home secretary Sajid Javid prefers the term &quot;compliant&quot; to &quot;hostile&quot; to describe that way the government wants to create an environment that discourages illegal immigration, he said: On behalf of the Windrush generation, keep in mind that spiritual, let freedom reign: it will only reign when this country turns back from the path it's on, ends the compliant environment in which I know my place, and starts along a humane path that at its heart has human rights... The Windrush generation are here because of slavery. The Windrush story is a story of British empire and the Windrush community and its ancestors know what hostile and compliance means. We know what compliance means: it's written deep into our souls and passed down from our ancestors. Slaves having to nod and smile when they were being whipped in a cotton field or a sugarcane field were compliant. Watching your partner being tied to a tree, beaten or raped on a plantation, is compliance. Twelve million people being transported as slaves from Africa to the colonies is a compliant environment. Peter Temple-Morris, the Conservative MP who defected to Labour after the 1997 election and who subsequently sat in the House of Lords as a Labour peers, has died, the BBC reports. Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, has backed Downing Street (see 4.08pm) in talking up the case for an inquiry into the bullying allegations against John Bercow (which he denies). In a statement she said: It is for Dame Laura Cox QC to consider whether the terms of reference of her independent inquiry need to be expanded, to allow for individual investigations to take place. I'm sure she will be looking very carefully at how best to respond to these latest developments. We must call out unacceptable behaviour and stand by the House staff who do so much for us. The independent complaints procedure that I am establishing for all who work in or visit parliament will, I believe, make parliament one of the best places in the world to work, and to be treated with dignity. I am determined to stamp out all forms of bullying and harassment in parliament, and separate to these allegations, I encourage any member of House staff who has experienced mistreatment to provide their confidential testimony to Dame Laura Cox. Everyone in Westminster has a responsibility to play their part in changing the culture in parliament. In the House of Lords peers are debating the EU withdrawal bill again. We are expecting another vote, and another government defeat, on an amendment tabled by Chris Patten, the Conservative former cabinet minister and former European commissioner (and head of an inquiry into policing in Northern Ireland in the 1990s). Patten's amendment, amendment 88, would prevent the government implementing Brexit in a way that undermined the Good Friday agreement or led to a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic. Opening the debate, Patten said that what he was asking for was in line with stated government policy. But he explained why he thought his amendment needed to be written into law. There are a number of members of the Conservative party in another place [the Commons] who are very keen for the over the cliff, onto the rocks Brexit and I think are making life rather more difficult for the prime minister to square circles than should be the case. Most of his speeech was about the importance of the Good Friday agreement. Here are some extracts. As the government say in their position paper, the issue of identity goes to the heart of the Good Friday agreement. And anybody who doubts that that's the case should look at curbstones, should consider flags. In 2012 the city council in Belfast decided it wanted to reduce the number of times during the year that the union flag was flown. Result: a year of demonstrations and civil disorder, 130 police officers injured, a political office firebombed. Ask yourself this question. Why is the Northern Ireland not working at the moment? Because of an article about identity, because of an argument about parity of esteem for different cultures and different loyalties. That is why it is not working. The genius of the Good Friday agreement was to extract from nationalists the commitment that they would only ask for change constitutionally in Northern Ireland if it was the process of democracy. And on the other hand they were told they didn't have to sign up to being loyal to all the usual symbols of what they regarded as the unionist state. It hasn't meant that everyone is loving one another to bits. But it has ended the violence. Violence which saw the deaths of a thousand police officers and soldiers during the Troubles, twice as many as died in Iraq or Afghanistan... There was a suggestion in the debate on the customs union that this House, by talking about that, by talking about the border and so on, was playing with fire. [Patten is referring to a speech by his Tory colleague Michael Forsyth.] I'll tell you what I think playing with fire is. I think playing with fire is blundering into the politics of Northern Ireland with a policy that is sometimes clueless, and sometimes delinquent, with a can of petrol and a box of matches in the other hand. I think that's playing with fire. I think that's what we're really in danger of doing... I don't want to go back to the old triumphs, the old humiliations, the old animosities, the old feuds. I think it would be shameful, shameful and dishonourable, if this House was do to anything that made this more likely. I think it would be a stain on our history. Shona Robison, the Scottish government's health secretary, has issued this statement about the breast screening bungle in England. She said: I want to reassure members of the public that this issue does not affect the NHS in Scotland and patients should be reassured that there are no problems with our breast screening programme records or IT systems. As usual, all women should continue to be aware of changes to their breasts and if they have any concerns they should see their GP. Scottish government officials will be working with Public Health England to identify any women affected in England who have subsequently moved to Scotland. Sir Jeremy Heywood, the cabinet secretary and head of the civil service, has tweeted a picture today of the most important whiteboard in Whitehall. It belongs to Sue Gray, who is leaving her post as director general of the propriety and ethics team at the Cabinet Office, and it is the one that reportedly gets wheeled out ever time there is a government reshuffle. Gray used to help decide who could go where, and this is the surface where the moves used to get mapped out. This is from HuffPost's Paul Waugh. According to ITV's Robert Peston, the cabinet's Brexit sub committee has wrapped up without coming to a conclusion on the customs union - as expected. (See 9.54am.) In the Commons Yvette Cooper, the Labour chair of the Commons home affairs committee is speaking now. The Conservative MP Jeremy Quin asks her, as a former government minister, what she thinks of the Labour motion. (See 10.51am.) He says it is very, very broad. It could lead to the disclosure of cabinet minutes, or information about communications with foreign governments, he says. Cooper says, although the motion says the Windrush papers should go to her committee, her committee has not discussed the matter. If the motion does get passed and her committee gets the papers, they will handle them &quot;in a very responsible way&quot;, she says. She says Windrush migrants ended by being treated as illegal immigrants by mistake. It is reasonable for the government to have targets, she says. But if there are targets, there must be safeguards. She also singles out the net migration target for criticism, saying that has encouraged the Home Office to deport people whether they are here legally or illegally. This is what Theresa May said at PMQs earlier when she announced an inquiry into the Windrush scandal. She told MPs: We all share the ambition to make sure we do right by members of the Windrush generation, which is why [Sajid Javid] will be announcing a package of measures to bring transparency on the issue, to make sure that the House is informed, and to reassure members of this House but, more importantly, to reassure those people who have been directly affected. Speed is of the essence and [Javid] will be commissioning a full review of lessons learned, independent oversight and external challenge, with the intention of reporting back to this House before we rise for the summer. The review will have full access to all relevant information in the Home Office, including policy papers and casework decisions. The Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants has condemned this as inadequate. Satbir Singh, its chief executive, issued this response. Nothing that the government has announced today in parliament will address the root causes of the Windrush scandal - namely the &quot;hostile environment&quot; policy. Hostility is still very much in play, the government still plans to roll Right to Rent out further to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland which independent evidence by JCWI has proven discriminates and harms. The hostile environment continues unabated denying people health care, stopping doctors and nurses and other workers we so desperately need, working in our beloved NHS. If the government was truly committed to learning any lessons it would stop this hostility in its tracks, treat people as people, not numbers and carry out a fully independent review of the Home Office's policies and practices. Joanna Cherry, the SNP's justice and home affair spokeswoman, is speaking in the debate now. She says it is &quot;astonishing&quot; that civil servants could be receiving bonuses for deporting illegal immigrants. That's &quot;disgusting&quot;, she says. The Times' Sam Coates says Tory whips seem to be nervous about the vote tonight. Javid says safeguards are being put in place to ensure that ongoing enforcement measures against illegal immigrants do not impact on Windrush migrants. He is winding up now. He says he is not alone in feeling that what happened to the Windrush generation made him angry. Something like this must never happen again, he says. Javid says he will be bringing forward legislation for the fee exemptions, fee reductions and changes to the citizenship process for the Windrush migrants. He will also be consulting on the compensation scheme that has been promised. Javid says complying with Labour's motion would take up too much government time. He describes it as a &quot;massive and open-ended fishing expedition&quot; which would require 100 officials to fulfil. The Conservative MP Simon Hoare intervenes. He says, since his appointment, Javid has been called &quot;a coconut&quot; and an &quot;uncle Tom&quot;. Javid says, under Jeremy Corbyn's leadership, the hard left has been more prominent. They are associated with the rise of antisemitism. He challenges Corbyn, who is on the Labour front bench, to condemn the racist insults directed at him. Corbyn does not intervene. But Diane Abbott does. She says she knows what it is like to suffer racist abuse. She says she has condemned the abuse directed at Javid. Everyone on the Labour side condemns it, she says. Sajid Javid, the new home secretary, is speaking now. He says there are men and women who have been let down. As he told MPs on Monday, he will do whatever is necessary to put that right. Labour's Catherine West intervenes. Is it true that bonuses are paid for the removal of illegal immigrants? Javid says bonuses are paid in the civil service. They are not a matter for ministers. Javid refuses to deny civil servants paid bonuses relating to the removal of illegal immigrants. Labour's Stephen Doughty intervenes. He points out that Javid refused to deny that bonuses were paid. He asks West's question again. Javid repeats the point about how ministers are not involved in bonuses. He says he has not looked at this. Back in the Commons, Abbott is still speaking. She says Theresa May has not resiled from the &quot;hostile environment&quot; policy. In 2012 she told the Daily Telegraph she wanted to create &quot;a really hostile environment&quot; for illegal immigrants, Abbott says. She says Sajid Javid, the new home secretary, will find he is not in charge of Home Office policy. May still wants to decide it, she says. Abbottt says May's policies created the problems for the Windrush generation. This issue will not go away. Labour will not stop until they get justice for the Windrush generation, she says. With Theresa May confronting her Brexit inner cabinet this afternoon, there was an intriguing little nugget in the post-PMQs briefing by her official spokesman. Brexiters have been briefing that they hope to use the meeting to force May to dump her preferred option of a &quot;customs partnership&quot;; while she and others including Philip Hammond are deeply sceptical about the alternative of &quot;max fac&quot;, or maximum facilitation. Asked about the PM's remarks in the House that there were &quot;a number of options&quot; for post-Brexit customs arrangements under consideration, May's spokesman said: Work has been ongoing on two options; that work has been proceeding. Ideas are obviously evolving as we go along; the prime minister said there's a number of options of ways to proceed. Pressed about whether there were still two options on the table - or more - he repeatedly insisted there were, &quot;a number of ways of taking this forward&quot;. That will spark speculation that Downing Street is preparing to propose a third option, as a way through what has become an increasingly ugly public standoff. Abbott says there are still Windrush migrants who are afraid of coming forward. She turns to the compensation issue. People are anxious. They want assurances that the compensation scheme will be adequate, she says. Abbott says MPs want to have the figures for how many people have been deported. The Conservative MP James Cartlidge rises to make a point of order. Is is it order to table a motion asking the Queen to break the Data Protection Act, he asks. He says what the motion proposes in relation to text messages would contravene the new GDPR (general data protection regulation) rules. Lindsay Hoyle, the deputy speaker, says that is not a point of order. Abbott says she has met Windrush migrants in detention centres. Abbott asks if Tory MPs will understand how voting against this motion will be seen in the Commonwealth, and by the Windrush generation. And will they understand how the Tory laughter comes across. Anna Soubry, a Conservative, rises on a point of order. There has been no laughing from the Conservative benches, she says. Abbott says people will have heard laughter. She says the Conservatives are not taking this seriously. Abbott says this story has been front page news across the Commonwealth, and not just in the Caribbean. What has been revealed about UK policy has been extremely damaging. That is one reason to clear up this mess, she says. Abbott says Labour does not support illegal immigration. She says Labour would prevent illegal immigrants coming into the country. But the government is not doing this because it has cut the number of border guards, she says. Abbott says she wants to address the role of the prime minister in this. A Conservative MP intervenes, and asks if Abbott is in favour of stopping illegal immigration. It is the second time a Tory has asked this. (Simon Hoare made a similar intervention a few minutes ago.) Some Labour MPs shout: &quot;Wrong debate.&quot; Abbott says nobody on the Labour benches supports illegal immigration. But it is distressing for Windrush generation migrants to hear the Conservatives keep dragging this back to illegal immigration. (The Conservatives are going for Abbott on this issue because she repeatedly refused to say what Labour would do about illegal immigrants in a TV interview earlier this week.) Abbott says May was to blame for the worst aspects of the &quot;hostile environment&quot; policy. She says May introduced a deport first, appeal later policy. She set deportation targets. And, given she set targets, May should have know that what Amber Rudd told the home affairs committee last week about the Home Office not having targets for removals was wrong, Abbott says. Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, is now opening the debate on the Labour Windrush motion. (See 10.51am.) She says the Windrush arrived in Britain on 22 June 1948. They were a patriotic generation who contributed a great deal to this country. This debate is about them, she says. Labour's Chuka Umunna intervenes. He says many of the Windrush arrivals settled in Brixton, in his constituency. That was because there was a deep air raid shelter which housed them when they arrived. But it was also because that was near the job centre, he says. They wanted to work. The Hunt statement is over. Maria Miller, the Conservative MP and chair of the women and equalities committee, raises a point of order and asks about the new allegations about bullying by John Bercow. Miller says a member of the Commons staff has signed a non-disclosure agreement. Does John Bercow agree that Commons staff should not sign agreements like this? And will Bercow make a statement. Bercow says current and former staff are not constrained by any agreements from speaking to the inquiry into the bullying of Commons staff. He says the clerk of the Commons has sent Miller a note about these agreements, known as compromise agreements. He says he is not involved in decisions about getting staff to sign these agreements. On the subject of the allegations against him, Bercow says he has nothing to add to the statement he has already put out. Julian Lewis, a Conservative MP and a friend of Bercow's, also rises. He asks Bercow to confirm that most of Bercow's staff have been happy working for him. Bercow confirms that. Theresa May believes that the latest bullying allegations against Commons Speaker John Bercow should be &quot;properly investigated&quot;, Downing Street has said. Asked about the latest allegations of bullying by Bercow, which he denies, the prime minister's spokesman said: The prime minister has been very clear from the start that there is no place for bullying or harassment of any kind in the workplace, including parliament. It is a matter for parliament to decide how to proceed, but the latest allegations are concerning and should be properly investigated. It's important to note that the speaker denies the claims which have been made against him. Here is the apology Hunt delivered in his opening statement. He said: Irrespective of when the incident started, the fact is that for many years oversight of our screening programme has not been good enough. Many families will be deeply disturbed by these revelations, not least because there will be some people who receive a letter having had a recent diagnosis of breast cancer. We must also recognise that there may be some who receive a letter having had a recent terminal diagnosis. For them and others it is incredibly upsetting to know that you did not receive an invitation for screening at the correct time and totally devastating to hear you may have lost or be about to lose a loved one because of administrative incompetence. So on behalf of the government, Public Health England and the NHS, I apologise wholeheartedly and unreservedly for the suffering caused. Hunt says all GPs will be briefed on what the appropriate response to this failure should be. Hunt says his understanding is that, for every 1,000 women in their 70s, 12 have a breast cancer and three of those are life threatening. In his response to Hunt, Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, said the &quot;thoughts of the whole House will be with those whose screening was missed and who sadly lost their lives from breast cancer or who have subsequently developed cancer&quot;. Ashworth welcomed Hunt's &quot;candour&quot; in questioning why the problem was not picked up. He went on: Eight years is a long time for an error of this magnitude to go undetected. Did the department receive any warnings in that time, is there any record of how many women raised concerns that they had not received appropriate screening, were there any opportunities to change this mistake which were missed? Hunt said: The existence of a potential issue was brought to the attention of the Department of Health and Social Care by Public Health England in January, although at that stage their advice was that the risk to patients was limited. An urgent clinical evaluation took place and the matter was &quot;escalated to ministers&quot; in March this year by PHE &quot;with clear clinical advice that the matter should not be made public&quot;. That was so a plan could be put in place first to ensure &quot;any remedies did not overwhelm the existing screening programme&quot;. This is from Vaughan Gething, the Welsh government's health secretary. Labour's Diana Johnson asks why letters are not going out today to all 309,000 women affected. Hunt says the letters are being sent out as quickly as possible. They cannot all be sent out today, he says. He accepts people will have to wait a few weeks to find out if they are getting a letter, and he says he appreciates that this will cause a lot of concern to those involved. Commenting on Hunt's announcement, Emma Greenwood, Cancer Research UK's director of policy and public affairs, said: It's very concerning to learn that so many women have not received an invitation to screening over a prolonged period of time. We know this may leave many women with questions about breast screening. If you suspect you have been directly affected by this or if you are over 50 and haven't had a mammogram in the last three years and would like one, the NHS Choices website provides further information and the option to contact your local unit to book an appointment. It's worth remembering that many breast cancers are still found by women themselves, outside of the screening programme, so if you notice any unusual changes in your breast, see your GP straight away. Labour's Lisa Nandy says this announcement is &quot;utterly heart-breaking&quot;. Unless further resources are put into the system, other people will go to the back of the queue. For too many women where they live determines whether they live or die, she says. Hunt says he recognises what Nandy is saying. He says additional resources will have to be found to ensure people are not disadvantaged. Hunt says anyone is free to call the helpline number. It will be published today. Letters should be sent out to women affected over the next four weeks. Women who do not get letters should be pretty confident they have not been affected, he says. Caroline Johnson, a Conservative and a doctor, asks what women who are worried about this news should do. Hunt says all women who should be scanned, or who might want to get a scan, will be offered on. He says this will happen before October. But in most cases people should get scans much earlier, he says. Here is an extract from Jeremy Hunt's statement to MPs. Earlier this year PHE [Public Health England] analysis of trial data from the service found that there was a computer algorithm failure dating back to 2009. The latest estimates I have received from PHE is that as a result of this, between 2009 and the start of 2018, an estimated 450,000 women aged between 68 and 71 were not invited to their final breast screening. At this stage it is not clear whether any delay in diagnosis resulted in any avoidable harm or death and that is one of the reasons I am ordering an independent review to establish the clinical impact. Our current best estimate which comes with caveats as it's based on statistical modelling rather than patient reviews, and because there is currently no clinical consensus about the benefits of screening for this age group, is that there may be between 135 and 270 women who had their lives shortened as a result. I am advised that it is unlikely to be more than this range and may be considerably less. However, tragically there are likely to be some people in this group who would have been alive today if the failure had not happened. Labour Paul Williams, a GP, asks if the update of screening of 68 to 71-year-olds during this period was less than expected. And, if so, why was that not investigated? Hunt says he will look into this. He does not know if there was a lower uptake. Normally the screening uptake rate is 80%, he says. Philippa Whitford, the SN's health spokeswoman and a breast surgeon, says she is concerned about Hunt's suggestion that, with older women, early diagnosis does not matter so much. She says early diagnosis is always important. She asks what efforts have been made to track down women affected. Hunt says he does not think he did say that you do not need to diagnose early. What he was saying was that, in many cases, early diagnosis will not make a difference. But diagnosis is always important, he says. Sarah Wollaston, the Conservative MP and GP who chairs the Commons health committee, says the woman affected need consistent, evidence-based guidance as to what they should do next. Hunt says the government has to be clear with patients that there is no medical consensus about the efficacy of screening for patients in the 70s. But anyone who wants a scan will get a scan, he says. Hunt says there is no consensus about the efficacy of breast cancer screening for older women. That is because older women are more likely to develop cancers, but those cancers are less likely to be life threatening, he says. Hunt says he wasnts to inform MPs of &quot;a serious failure that has come to light&quot; in the breast cancer screening programme. Some 2m women get screened every year, he says. Earlier this year it was found that a computer algorithm problem meant that between 2009 and the start of 2018 some 450,000 women aged between 68 and 71 were not invited to their final screening. Some 450,000 women missed a breast cancer screening, Hunt says. He says at this stage it is unclear whether any delay in diagnosis will have resulted in any avoidable or delay or death. He says the best estimate, based on modelling, is that there will be between 135 and 270 women who had their lives shortened as a result of this. There are unlikely to be more fatalities than that, and the number could be less, he says. There are likely to be some people in this group who would have been alive today if this failure had not happened. Up to 270 women may have died because they missed a screening, Hunt says. He says ministers were told about this in March. Public Health England advised that the public should not be told then, to allow time for remedial measures to be put in He says 309,000 of the 450,000 women who missed out are still alive. People will get clinical advise as to whether more screening is helpful. In some cases screening will be counter-productive. But he says patients will get a choice. Hunt says this covers England. Patients in Scotland and Wales are not thought to be affected. He says the government will contact thte next of kin of those who missed a scan and died of breast cancer. The government will try to establish if the missed scan was a factor. He says if it was, compensation will be paid. Compensation to be paid to families of women who died from cancer after missing a screening, Hunt says. He accepts these findings will be very disturbing for people. Some people will get a letter saying they missed out knowing they now have a terminal illness. He says he apologise wholeheartedly to those people for the suffering caused. He says there will be an independent review of the breast screening programme. Hunt announces independent inquiry into breast screening programme. He says he wants to be transparent about what went wrong. Jeremy Hunt is now making his statement about breast cancer screening. (See 11.56am.) Labour's Gloria de Piero says an 83-year-old woman who had a fall at home in her constituency had to wait three hours for an ambulance. Will May apologise to her? May says she is sorry to hear about that. She will look into it. Nicky Morgan, a Conservative, says the Treasury committee, which she chairs, will take evidence from TSB later about its IT failure. Does May agree that robust IT is vital for banking? May says banks should have robust and stable IT systems. Marcus Jones, a Conservative, says council tax rates doubled under Labour. Doesn't this show the government was right to cap council tax increases? May agrees. She says Conservative councils have been freezing or cutting council tax. Conservative councils on average cost families &pound;100 less in council tax, she says. The SNP's Chris Stephens asks about the pay rise for civil servants. Doesn't it amount to a real-terms pay cut? May says the 1% cap on public sector pay rises has been abandoned. Simon Hoare, a Conservative, asks about the 464 survivors of thalidomide. Will May ask the Foreign Office to intervene with Germany, which has gone back on a compensation promise. (The drug was developed in Germany.) May says the Foreign Office is pursuing this. Labour's Paula Sherriff asks why the government has not appointed an equalities champion to ensure BAME people get access to better mental health provision. May says it was precisely to address issues like this that she launched the racial disparities audit. Sir Bill Cash, the Tory Brexiter, says the European scrutiny committee that he chairs has repeatedly asked her chief Brexit adviser, Olly Robbins, to appear. But he won't. Will May ensure that he does give evidence? May says she will look into this. Labour's Karen Buck asks why the government is still considering two EU customs options that are seen as unworkable. May says if Buck is so interested in this, she should asks the Labour front bench to decide its own policy on it. Labour's Jo Stevens asks May if she agrees with Sajid Javid about the &quot;hostile environment&quot; not representing British values. May says she agrees with what Javid said about the importance of differentiating between legal immigration and illegal immigration. She says he was referring to a phrase. But it was a phrase first used by Labour. Amber Rudd, who resigned as home secretary on Sunday night, starts by congratulating Sajid Javid on his appointment. She says the UK threat level remains at severe. Last year five terrorist attacks got through. Will May share with her her admiration for the work of the security services? May says she is pleased to be able to pay tribute to Rudd for the work she did as home secretary. She says Rudd's work with internet companies was ground breaking. And she says she agrees with what Rudd said about the work of the intelligence agencies and emergency services. (That exchange is a fairly clear sign that Rudd will not be joining the pro-European Tory rebels.) PMQs - Snap verdict: That wasn't really a PMQs at all; we just had two PPBs (party political broadcasts) blaring away in tandem, doing little to enlighten anyone. Corbyn's PPB was better on passion, and it covered wider ground - in fact, there was little area of public policy where he failed to castigate the government - but May probably did better on specific, memorable detail (her Hazelbourne Road anecdote). The local elections take place tomorrow, and so perhaps this wasn't surprising. Corbyn did start with a neat, sassy question about Windrush. But May's announcement about an inquiry into what went wrong disarmed him, and also helped to explain why the Tory whips feel comfortable about ordering their MPs to vote against the Labour motion calling for all confidential government paperwork on Windrush to be disclosed later this afternoon. The government clearly feels that this will be enough to contain demands for the full disclosure of documents, although the inquiry she announced sounded very minimalist. She described it as a &quot;full review of lessons learned&quot; rather than a proper inquiry, and it does not sound as if it will be especially independent. (She talked about &quot;independent oversight and external challenge&quot;, which is not quite the same as having an independent person in charge.) It will also concluded before the end of July, which means it may be one of the shortest inquiries on record. Corbyn says the education secretary has been corrected by the UK Statistics Authority. It says budgets are being cut. Yet May is in denial. And police budgets are an issue too. Home Office civil servants says there is a link between budget cuts and increased crime. May says she has protected police budgets. That is not what Andy Burnham proposed when he was shadow home secretary. She says the shadow home affairs minister has said there is no relationship between police numbers and crime figures. Corbyn says the shadow police minister was pointing to a cut in police budgets. Some 21,000 police officers have lost their jobs since 2010. Violent crime is rising. Deaths from knife crime are going up, especially in London. The government is making a complete shambles of Brexit, damaging the NHS, damaging schools, and yet they claim to be strong and stable. With council tax rising by more than 5% all over the country, isn't the truth that with the Tories you pay more and get less. May says there is more funding going into the NHS, schools and social care. If Corbyn wants to talk about council tax, he should go to Hazelbourne Road in Clapham. On one side houses in Labour Lambeth people pay very high council tax. On the other side, in Conservative Wandworth, people pay much less. That shows people pay less under the Conservatives. Corbyn offers facts about the inquiry. There are more people in debt, more people using food banks, more people in debt and more people in poverty. The NHS is suffering the longest funding squeeze in history. Will May apologise for this? May says there are more people in work, and fewer people in absolute poverty. She says the chancellor has announced &pound;10bn extra for the NHS. She is conducting a review to find a long-term plan. That is the sensible approach to take. It is about funding and reform. Corbyn says March was the worst month on record for A&amp;E. It was also the worst month for cancelled operation. There are thousands of vacancies for NHS staff. But May intervened personally to stop the NHS hiring from abroad. He says the education secretary used to say there would be no cut in schools funding. Last week he refused to repeat that pledge. Will May admit schools budgets are being cut? May says there is more money for schools. It is not just a question of how much money you put in. She says 1.9m children are in outstanding schools under this government. Jeremy Corbyn also pays tribute to Michael Martin. They first met when they were both organisers for the NUPE union in the 1970s. Did the PM feel the slightest pang of guilt when Amber Rudd was forced to resign due to the actions of her predecessor? May says she will start by updating MPs on Windrush issues. Sajid Javid will address MPs on this later today. He will announce a package of measures to bring transparency on this issue. She says speed of of the essence. She says there will be a review of lessons learnt. It will report before the summer and will have full access to all papers. May announces review into what went wrong with Windrush scandal, to report before summer. May says the government needs to build more homes. The housing infrastructure fund helps. Theresa May starts by offering condolences to the family and friends of Michael Martin, the former speaker who has died. She pays tribute to his courtesy in particular. Wera Hobhouse, the Lib Dem MP, asks about upskirting. It is not a specific offence. She has worked on a bill to make it a specific crime. Will May back changing the law on this. May says she agrees. She shares the outrage at this intrusive behaviour. The government wants to ensure victims' complaints are taken seriously. The justice secretary will consider Hobhouse's proposed law change. PMQs is about to start. This is from Chris Smyth, health editor at the Times. This is from the Telegraph's Kate McCann. Jeremy Hunt is making a statement to MPs after PMQs. This is from the BBC's diplomatic editor, James Landale. And here is a reply from the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg. The 30-page memo circulated by the European Research Group criticising the customs partnership proposal (see 9.33am) lists nine objects to the proposal. Here they are: 1 - The administrative burden of this system would mean low real uptake of UK tariff rates. 1 - The administrative burden of this system would mean low real uptake of UK tariff rates, because firms would be under a range of requirements to prove they are entitled to receive the relevant tariff rebates. 2 - Exporters to the UK would need their customers in the UK to pay EU tariffs, then try to claim them back by proving that the goods had gone to a UK end-consumer. 3 - Our trade partners would be deterred from agreeing mutual tariff reductions by their having to pay EU tariff rates up front. 4 - The UK would have less negotiating leverage over a potential trade partner's trade barriers and behind the border regulatory barriers. 5 - EU quotas make the problem yet more complex. 6 - Only large corporates would be able to carry the significant administrative burdens of this system. 7 - Crucially, this option also frustrates UK regulatory independence. 8 - If the above factors mean that uptake of the rebate scheme is low, this would mean that the tariffs levied in practice on goods entering the UK market could be higher than the UK's bound rate, which would be a violation of the GATT. 9 - The UK would continue to be a substantial tax collector for the EU, continuing to make a substantial net contribution to the EU budget. And here is an extract from the conclusion. The NCP proposed is undeliverable in operational terms and would require a degree of regulatory alignment that would make the execution of an independent trade policy a practical impossibility. This covers not only our external trade agenda but our own control over UK regulation and whether we can improve it. Economists have recently described a &quot;new normal&quot; of limited global growth, potentially secular global stagnation. This can be avoided by a group of countries committing to reduce the distortions found in anticompetitive regulation. For example, a 20% reduction in distortions in the TPP 11, plus the UK and US, over 15 years could yield approximately an added 0.5% into global GDP year-on-year (c.$2 trillion over the period), according to some estimates. Set against this, customs clearance costs are small. (It should be noted that the estimates of the impact of behind the border barrier reduction are conservative, ignoring distortion reductions elsewhere, for example in China, that this approach may yield, nor do they assume any interaction effects.) Any form of the customs arrangements above would mean continuing curtailment of UK capacity for independent trade and self-government, plus ECJ jurisdiction, applying harmonised rules and regulations across the domestic UK economy; they also mean external tariffs and abiding by future changes, but without a vote. Turning back to the customs partnership, these are from the BBC's Norman Smith. The &quot;hybrid model&quot; is the customs partnership, the proposal that Tory Brexiters are opposing. See 9.54am. &quot;Max fac&quot; is the other one. Dominic Raab is the Brexiter housing minister. UPDATE: Here is the Raab quote. He was speaking to Radio 5 Live. I always keep an open mind on this, because I do think when it comes to Brexit, we're going to be forging a distinct path for the UK, not taking some off-the-shelf model. But I suspect, actually in terms of delivering the two things that we need, which is to stay out of the customs union, but also avoid the hard border, as a matter of principle but also workability, at the moment, the way I read it, is that those in favour of 'max fac' are winning the argument. But I don't want to prejudice the debate cabinet should have and must have in order to hammer this out. If you look at the roll-on, roll-off ports, the pre-arrival notification of goods and customs declarations, if you look at the option of having authorised economic operators, and all of the stuff that has already been tried and tested on the US/Canada border, or on the Australia/New Zealand border, I think it [maximum facilitation] is actually the one that's been tried and tested the most. Labour has accused the government of a cover up and of shedding &quot;crocodile tears&quot; over Windrush in the light of its decision to whip its MPs to vote against the opposition day motion. A Labour spokesperson said: If the architect of this cruel farce, the prime minister, is ordering her MPs to vote to keep her role in this mess hidden from the public, it exposes the Tories' crocodile tears on the Windrush scandal as a sham. We need answers, not further cover ups to save Theresa May from facing up to her involvement in the removal of rights, detentions and possible deportations of British citizens. After letting Rudd take the fall for her decisions, how can the public have any trust in the prime minister? We are likely to hear much more of this at PMQs in an hour's time. Conservative MPs are being whipped to vote against the Labour opposition day motion saying the government should publish papers, correspondence and advice on Windrush between ministers, senior officials and advisors from May 2010 until now, we've been told. That means there will be a vote at 7pm. Until now the government has tended not to vote against opposition day motions. Generally they are not binding on the government, and ministers found it easier to ignore motions they did not like than to run the risk of staging a vote and losing. That led to the Labour party using their opposition days to table &quot;humble address&quot; motions demanding the release of particular government papers to select committees. These motions, which used to be used very rarely, are binding on the government. Last year there were motions ordering the release of the government's Brexit impact assessments and of universal credit project assessments. Both were passed without opposition because the government did not order its MPs to vote against. Today the whips are taking a different approach and are instructing their MPs to vote against the Labour motion. Why? Presumably because they are reasonably confident of winning. The Labour motion is very wide-ranging, because it requires all internal government documents, including emails and text messages, relating to Windrush-related policy decisions to be handed over to the Commons home affairs committee (which would then be free to publish the material). Many MPs might argue that that is unreasonable, because even under the Freedom of Information Act there is an acceptance that government decision making is protected by some degree of confidentiality. But the key point is that the motion seems to have been drafted with the express intent of uncovering material likely to embarrass Theresa May and establish her culpability in the Windrush affair. Many Tory MPs are embarrassed about Windrush, but at some point tribal loyalty kicks in and they would have to feel very strongly about this to vote for something so nakedly hostile to their party leader. So the Tories may well win. But it won't look good, because it will look like a cover-up. For reference, here is the wording of the motion in full. That an humble address be presented to Her Majesty, that she will be graciously pleased to give directions that the following papers be provided to the home affairs committee: all papers, correspondence and advice including emails and text messages, from 11 May 2010 up to and including 1 May 2018, to and between ministers, senior officials and special advisers relating to policy decisions including on the Immigration Acts 2014 and 2016 with regard the Windrush generation cases, including deportations, detentions and refusal of re-entry, the setting of deportation and removal targets and their effect on the Windrush generation, and action taken within government following the concerns raised by Caribbean governments with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office including the original decision by the prime minister not to meet Caribbean heads of government and officials, and all copies of minutes and papers relating to the cabinet's immigration implementation taskforce. In his interview on the Today programme David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister, confirmed what the Guardian reported overnight - that today's meeting of the key Brexit cabinet sub committee is not expected to take a decision today as to whether the &quot;customs partnership&quot; or the alternative &quot;highly streamlined customs arrangement&quot; (which is now being referred to as &quot;maximum facilitation&quot;, or &quot;max fac&quot;, in Whitehall). He said the committee's discussions would &quot;start this afternoon and will probably continue in other meetings&quot;. He went on: This will be the first time today for cabinet colleagues to sit down and have a constructive discussion about the way forward. I expect we will come to a decision on this, as well as on other important elements of our negotiating position, over the next few weeks. For reference, this is what the government's future partnership paper (pdf) on customs published last summer said about the two options. The government believes that there are two broad approaches the UK could adopt to meet these objectives. These approaches represent different choices about the nature of our relationship with the EU and countries around the world, but in either option the UK would seek to pursue its independent trade policy objectives. A highly streamlined customs arrangement between the UK and the EU, streamlining and simplifying requirements, leaving as few additional requirements on EU trade as possible. This would aim to: continue some of the existing arrangements between the UK and the EU; put in place new negotiated and potentially unilateral facilitations to reduce and remove barriers to trade; and implement technology-based solutions to make it easier to comply with customs procedures. This approach involves utilising the UK's existing tried and trusted third country processes for UK-EU trade, building on EU and international precedents, and developing new innovative facilitations to deliver as frictionless a customs border as possible. A new customs partnership with the EU, aligning our approach to the customs border in a way that removes the need for a UK-EU customs border. One potential approach would involve the UK mirroring the EU's requirements for imports from the rest of the world where their final destination is the EU. This is of course unprecedented as an approach and could be challenging to implement and we will look to explore the principles of this with business and the EU. Theresa May has opened talks with Brussels on the UK's future relationship with the EU after Brexit. But any negotiation with Michel Barnier can't really match, in terms of the strength of passion engaged, or the risk it poses to her own premiership, the negotiation she is having to conduct simultaneously with her own backbenchers. And today that negotiation has hit a crisis point. The European Research Group (ERG), which is led by Jacob Rees-Mogg and represents around 50 Tory backbenchers committed to a harder form of Brexit, has sent her a long report arguing that the &quot;customs partnership&quot; proposals - one of the government's two post-Brexit customs options for when the UK leaves the EU, and one that May is reluctant to drop - is unacceptable. The Daily Telegraph and the Daily Mail are both leading with the story. One of the peculiarities of this is that, when the government first floated the customs partnership idea in a policy paper last summer (pdf), the Brexiters did not complain about it at all. But now, in leave circles, it is being vilified as being almost equivalent to remaining in the EU. Here is an extract from the Telegraph splash (paywall). One ERG source said: &quot;We have swallowed everything so far - but this is it. If they don't have confidence in Brexit we don't have confidence in them. The prime minister will not have a majority if she does not kill off the NCP [New Customs Partnership].&quot; Mr Rees-Mogg added: &quot;The customs partnership is incompatible with the Conservative party manifesto.&quot; A copy of the report, obtained by The Daily Telegraph, dismantles the argument for a customs partnership which Brexiteers fear will keep Britain effectively in a customs union with the European Union after the UK leaves in March next year. Rees-Mogg got the 8.10am slot on the Today programme to discuss this further (a sign of the influence he exerts on the government - David Lidington, who is supposedly May's effective deputy prime minister, was relegated to the less prestigious 8.40 slot). And Rees-Mogg insisted that the the ERG were not threatening to bring down the prime minister over this. There is no question of there being an ultimatum. This is a paper that has been produced on a specific aspect of policy that would not work, that would not effectively take us out of the European Union. It would leave us de facto in both the customs union and the single market. At this point he sounded not entirely unlike someone running a protection racket. &quot;Very nice majority you've got here, prime minister. Great shame if anything were to happen to it.&quot; Later he claimed that the ERG was actually doing May a favour. When it was put to him that his stance was damaging her negotiating position, he replied: I don't think it does, actually, because there is no point in negotiating with something that the other side think is magical thinking. The sooner the government gets away from this customs partnership, the easier it will be to get onto a negotiating that might actually happen. Here is the agenda for the day. 10am: George Osborne, the former Conservative chancellor, gives evidence to the Commons education committee as chair of the Northern Powerhouse Partnership. 11.50am: Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, gives a speech to the Joseph Rowntree Foundation industrial strategy conference. 10.45am: The Metropolitan Police and the National Crime Agency give evidence to the Lords EU home affairs sub committee on the proposed UK-EU security treaty. 12pm: Theresa May faces Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs. Around 1pm: MPs begin a debate on a Labour motion intended to force the government to publish all papers, correspondence and advice on Windrush between ministers, senior officials and advisors from May 2010 until now. After 3.30pm: Peers resume their debate on the EU withdrawal bill. They are expected to vote on an amendment tabled by the Conservative peer Chris Patten that would stop the government agreeing a Brexit deal that created a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to post a summary at the end of the day. You can read all today's Guardian politics stories here. Here is the Politico Europe round-up of this morning's political news from Jack Blanchard. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today' top 10 must reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I'm on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments BTL but normally I find it impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include &quot;Andrew&quot; in it somewhere and I'm more likely to find it. I do try to answer direct questions, although sometimes I miss them or don't have time.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook recently found itself up to its neck in theCambridge Analyticascandal, with boss Mark Zuckerberg ending up in front of US lawmakers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the centre of it all was misuse of people's personal data and invasions of privacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in weeks the whole personal data game will change with a new piece of legislation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The General Data Protection Regulation comes into force in Europe on May 25, and confusing emails about it are already filling inboxes nationwide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     From a Facebook dating app to a new VR headset: Everything Mark Zuckerberg revealed at the F8 conference                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GDPR affects any company or organisation which processes the data of any EU citizen, and applies whether or not that company is based in the EU. So this means Google andFacebook, too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And it is unaffected byBrexit- the Government is implementing the Data Protection Bill, which largely mirrors the GDPR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the law is large and complex, importantly it gives individuals more rights to information held about them, as well as control over how their data is used.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here is everything you need to know about the GDPR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Practically everyone. If you have signed up to any kind of online service, whether it is a Clubcard from Tesco or a Gmail account from Google, you will be covered by the new legislation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only people whose data it does not cover is the deceased.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is not just about being online, either. People who do not use the internet are still covered as their data may be processed so they can receive letters or magazine subscriptions through the post.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Furthermore, if you are an employee, you will have certain rights because the company you work for is processing your data in order to pay your salary, provide you with equipment or know where you are during work hours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Any firm with employees will have to make them aware of when and how their data is being used.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First, you can expect to be told more about how your data is being used. Second, you can request access to it and ask for copies of it, or have the entire process stopped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What's more, firms have to be clear and transparent about everything, which is why you might be getting a flurry of emails asking you to tick boxes to give your consent for use of your data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You may also see new icons pop up on your mobile phone to indicate that you are agreeing something will need to process data, such as your email address, phone number or even your location.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, on an iPhone, you will now see a small blue icon of two people shaking hands; Apple's way of telling you a feature needs access to your information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Facebook is testing a feature that asks users whether posts on their timeline contain hate speech                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Part of the reason companies are taking such notice of GDPR is that the fines involved for noncompliance are gigantic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the most serious breaches, regulators will be able to issue penalties equivalent to up to 4% of annual global turnover or (EURO)20million; whichever is greater. For giant companies, these fines could run into hundreds of millions of pounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It already appears to be. Many large technology and internet companies have begun the process of making their data practices more transparent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Facebook and Twitter have been rolling out updates to their privacy policies, adding clearer language and description of data use, and offering more tools to users to share or remove their personal data from that platform.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you start receiving letters from companies asking for your consent to continue doing the things they were doing before, that is the GDPR at work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">just make sure you decide if you want them to continue or not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, you should. Increasingly your personal data is the currency that fuels the online world. The more control you have over it, the better.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As part of the new laws, companies must give users greater access to controls around what data they share and want to keep private.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook, for example, is rolling out a tool that enables users to opt-in to facial recognition being used to scan their photos, but also the chance to switch it off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And, fanfare, you are now able to reject or opt out of things such as direct marketing at any point, so it is the perfect time to finally stop all those spam messages.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MPs have ordered Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg to give evidence to the inquiry into fake news by May 24 - or face a summons next time he's on British soil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The select committee for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport has given the billionaire chief executive until May 11 to respond to the demand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook's chief technical officer Mike Schroepfer testified before the inquiry on April 26 but committee chair Damian Collins found his evidence &quot;lacked many of the important details that we need&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Collins has askedFacebookto answer almost 40 questions which he says Mr Schroepfer &quot;failed to answer fully&quot; also by May 11 and published the full list of questions on its website.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his letter to Facebook UK's head of public policy Rebecca Stimson, Mr Collins wrote: &quot;Following reports that he will be giving evidence to the European Parliament in May, we would like Mr Zuckerberg to come to London during his European trip. We would like the session here to take place by 24 May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is worth noting that, while Mr Zuckerberg does not normally come under the jurisdiction of the UK Parliament, he will do so the next time he enters the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We hope that he will respond positively to our request, but if not the Committee will resolve to issue a formal summons for him to appear when he is next in the UK.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Zuckerberg is expected to address the recent data privacy scandals that have engulfed the company later today in his first public appearance since being questioned by the US Congress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. What is the percentage of sites on the internet on which Facebook tracks users?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Did the Internet Research Agency use custom audiences? What targeting tools did the IRA use for their advertising? Did they have a custom audience for state-by-state campaigns/races in the USA? Did they use look-alike audiences from Facebook as part of their advertising spend?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. What is Facebook's definition of a political advertisement? What budget does Facebook put behind examining the parameters and use of political adverts?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. How many developers did your enforcement team at Facebook take action against between 2011-2014?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Does the NDA signed with Dr Kogan prevent legal action being taken? What was the date of the agreement? Was there a payment made to Dr Kogan?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[NB later in the session Mr Schroepfer said that a) the date was June 2016 and that b) no payment was made, but it would be useful to have these points confirmed in writing. Confirmation was given in the session that the full NDA document would be provided to the Committee.]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Who was the person at Facebook responsible for the decision not to tell users affected in 2015?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Who at Facebook heads up the investigation into Cambridge Analytica, including all the strands of the investigation?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Has Joseph Chancellor signed an NDA?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Agreement to provide documentation that Cambridge Analytica had certified the deletion of the data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. What was the number of paid adverts from the IRA during the US election?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">11. From which country did the $2million that AIQ spent on ads come?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">12. How many UK Facebook users and Instagram users were contacted by non-UK entities during the EU referendum?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">13. How many clicks or swipes does it take to alter your Facebook privacy settings on a smartphone? What steps are you taking to reduce the lengthy process of changing one's privacy settings?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">14. What proportion of political campaigning ads globally are run on your platform? Do you have a rough estimate, based on average political campaign spend data?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">15. What data on dark ads do you have?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">16. Is it possible for Facebook to view pages set up during elections (e.g. the EU Referendum campaign) that host dark ads, and then are taken down a day later? Is it possible that no-one would ever be able to audit these dark ads, as no one (not even Facebook) would see them during the time they are online?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">17. Was there any link between the US elections and the 2017 purge of fake accounts?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">18. What proportion of the fake accounts you purged had any involvement from Russia?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">19. Do you know how many developers were using and selling data on to third parties such as GSR? Is GSR the only company that has received letters from Facebook, demanding that they delete their Facebook data?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">20. What kind of developer activity leading up to 2014 led to Facebook's major policy changes related to sharing friends' data? (Please give specific examples.) Were these changes responding to genuine concerns among Facebook users?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">21. How many Facebook staff have been added to the app review team since 2014?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">22. What is the legal situation regarding Facebook storing non-Facebook users' data?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">23. Did Facebook pass user information to Cambridge Analytica or to Aleksandr Kogan?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">24. At the 8 February evidence session, Chris Matheson asked Simon Milner, &quot;Have you ever passed any user information over to Cambridge Analytica or any of its associated companies?&quot; Simon Milner replied &quot;No&quot;. Chris Matheson asked, &quot;But they do hold a large chunk of Facebook's user data, don't they?&quot; Simon Milner said, &quot;No. They may have lots of data, but it will not be Facebook user data. It may be data about people who are on Facebook that they have gathered themselves, but it is not data that we have provided.&quot; [Qq 447-448] Do you agree with this answer?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">25. At the time of Simon Milner's testimony in February 2018, who at Facebook knew about Cambridge Analytica? Who was in charge?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">26. When did Mark Zuckerberg know about Cambridge Analytica?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">27. Can you tell us about the financial links between SCL and Cambridge Analytica? (In evidence Mr Schroepfer said he had knowledge to share about this.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">28. How much money has been made from fraudulent ads (for example - but not limited to - the recent case of financial expert Martin Lewis?) When you find out they have been fraudulent, do you return the money to the purchaser of the ads?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">29. Can we see copies of adverts from AIQ? Who saw these adverts shown to? Who paid for them?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">30. Why wasn't GSR identified during audits of third party developers?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">31. How can the feature allowing users to edit previews of article (in response to concerns over Fake News) be removed?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">32. What work is Joseph Chancellor doing right now for Facebook? What is his job title? Was Facebook aware of Joseph Chancellor's involvement in GSR at the time of his application to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the company, or during his employment?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">33. Mr Schroepfer said that recruitment is taking place to boost work being done in Myanmar. When is this happening and can you provide more details?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">34. What is the average time taken to respond to content that has been reported to Facebook in the region?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">35. How many fake accounts have been identified and removed in Myanmar?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">36. How much of your revenue is derived from Myanmar?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">37. Are custom audiences used as a tool by AIQ using the GSR data from the US? What was the total value of AIQ/Vote Leave spend on Facebook? Can we see examples and copies of adverts that they used? To whom were they sent, and who decided what kind of targeting to use?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">38. Is there evidence that CA/SCL shared data with AIQ?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">39. Why was data responsibility moved from Facebook Irl to Facebook Inc in California just one month before GDPR kicks in?</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The co-founder of WhatsApp has left parent company Facebook after reportedly clashing with the company's attempts to water down his messaging app's commitment to privacy.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jan Koum, who co-founded the messaging service with Brian Acton almost a decade ago, has said that it is &quot;time to move on&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although he didn't give a specific reason for the departure, reports from the Washington Post citing unnamed sources suggest that Facebook's attempt to use personal data from WhatsApp (which it acquired in February 2014) had something to do with his decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brian Acton, who left FAcebook last September, has already been vocal about Facebook's use of personal data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He urged people to deleteFacebookas part of an online campaign that sprung up in response to theCambridge Analyticascandal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Facebook reveals plans to vet political adverts following Cambridge Analytica scandal                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jan Koum resignation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO of Facebook, commented on Koum's post and said he was grateful for teaching him about encryption and &quot;its ability to take power from centralised systems and put it back in people's hands&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Those values will always be at the heart of WhatsApp,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WhatsApp has grown to become the most popular messaging app in the world with over 1.5 billion users globally. Part of its popularity is the end-to-end encryption that the service provides.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook picked up the service for nearly $19 billion (&pound;13 billion) in 2014 and has plans to use data from the service, such as phone numbers, to target adverts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Facebook announces privacy changes for GDPR - and brings facial recognition to the UK                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">European regulators weren't too happy with that with GDPR on the horizon, so Facebook said it has halted the plans for the moment. Although there's no telling if they will be picked up again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Koum didn't say what his future business plans were or what his departure date is. But he did say he would be focusing on things outside of technologyu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm leaving at a time when people are using WhatsApp in more ways than I could have imagined,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The team is stronger than ever and it'll continue to do amazing things.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm taking some time off to do things I enjoy outside of technology, such as collecting rare air-cooled Porsches, working on my cars and playing ultimate frisbee.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">618 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For many parents, opening the ClassDojo app and looking at photographs of their child's latest work or sending a message to the teacher will be a regular part of the school week. According to the San Francisco-based company, it has been used by 70% of schools in the UK. But the classroom app came under scrutiny this weekend - the Times raised privacy concerns, highlighting how its data was stored in the US &quot;and, under its terms, some may be shared with the 22 third-party service providers it works with, including Facebook and Google&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The app is used to encourage good behaviour and to communicate with parents - children are awarded points for skills such as &quot;working hard&quot; and &quot;perseverance&quot;, and deducted points for &quot;disrespect&quot;. The teacher can also upload photographs and videos to the service. It is used, according to the company, by 90% of US elementary and middle schools, and last year Forbes estimated it was worth $100m.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ben Williamson, a lecturer in education at the University of Stirling and the author of Big Data in Education, became aware of it when it was introduced at his children's school. It launched in 2011 and its behavioural monitoring has been criticised for labelling children at an early age and for making the classroom a competitive space. &quot;What we don't really have are detailed studies of how this is working in classrooms,&quot; he says. &quot;A lot of teachers seem to love it; other teachers think it's ghastly because of this behaviourist reward system.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company now appears to be repositioning itself as a social media platform for schools; there is less focus on behavioural monitoring.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ClassDojo says it doesn't share any student information with Google or Facebook, and a spokesperson said the app is &quot;fully compliant with all UK privacy laws, is certified under the EU - US Privacy Shield and will be fully compliant with GDPR when the law goes into effect. No part of our mission requires sensitive student information, so we don't collect any. We ask for the minimum necessary to set up the service: a student's name (or nickname) and a randomly-assigned cartoon avatar. We also operate a '12-month deletion policy': if students and parents are no longer using ClassDojo, we automatically delete students' information after 12 months.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sandra Leaton Gray, a senior lecturer in education at the UCL Institute of Education and the author of Invisibly Blighted: The Digital Erosion of Childhood, says she is concerned with its potential to label children, but also its dedication to &quot;growth mindset&quot; - a theory of how intelligence can be encouraged and developed. She says: &quot;Sometimes teachers latch on to terms like that and see them as a shortcut to improving outcomes without having read all the extensive research on it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for what it does with the data, Williamson points out &quot;the company doesn't claim to have generated any profit but it has had massive venture capital investment, so presumably at some point the community needs to make a return on investment. The founders claim they would never sell children's data for advertising but the question is what could they do with all the behavioural information reported by teachers through the app.&quot; Next month the General Data Protection Regulation comes in, the new data protection law framework, and Williamson's concern is that schools are really not in a position to address some of the issues that might raise. I'd like to see more governmental leadership.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The app, Williamson says, was marketed &quot;straight into the hands of teachers. It extended itself through word of mouth and ended up in classrooms well ahead of any wider understanding of the potential data privacy and protection risks associated with it.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The gambling industry is increasingly using artificial intelligence to predict consumer habits and personalise promotions to keep gamblers hooked, industry insiders have revealed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Current and former gambling industry employees have described how people's betting habits are scrutinised and modelled to manipulate their future behaviour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The industry is using AI to profile customers and predict their behaviour in frightening new ways,&quot; said Asif, a digital marketer who previously worked for a gambling company. &quot;Every click is scrutinised in order to optimise profit, not to enhance a user's experience.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've often heard people wonder about how they are targeted so accurately and it's no wonder because its all hidden in the small print.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Publicly, gambling executives boast of increasingly sophisticated advertising keeping people betting, while privately conceding that some are more susceptible to gambling addiction when bombarded with these type of bespoke ads and incentives. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gamblers' every click, page view and transaction is scientifically examined so that ads statistically more likely to work can be pushed through Google, Facebook and other platforms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They'll know everything about an individual from their inside leg measurement onwards,&quot; said Nick, a consultant within the gambling industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Users unwittingly consent to the use of their data in ways they aren't aware of due to lengthy terms and conditions, enabling their information to legally be used in this way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Once someone has logged into a gambling platform it can do whatever they want with them,&quot; said Brian, a digital marketer for the gambling industry. &quot;It's like a science, it's not just random advertising messages, the whole thing is personalised, and data-driven customer profiles are constructed from gamblers' behaviour.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last August, the Guardian revealed the gambling industry uses third-party companies to harvest people's data, helping bookmakers and online casinos target people on low incomes and those who have stopped gambling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite condemnation from MPs, experts and campaigners, such practices remain an industry norm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You can buy email lists with more than 100,000 people's emails and phone numbers from data warehouses who regularly sell data to help market gambling promotions,&quot; said Brian. &quot;They say it's all opted in but people haven't opted in at all.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this way, among others, gambling companies and advertisers create detailed customer profiles including masses of information about their interests, earnings, personal details and credit history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I never cease to be amazed at how low the gambling industry is prepared to go to exploit those who have indicated an interest in gambling,&quot; says Carolyn Harris, a Labour MP who has campaigned for gambling reform.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The industry is geared to get people addicted to something that will cause immense harm, not just to society but to individuals and their families. They are parasitical leeches and I will offer no apology for saying that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   Technology outpacing legislation                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Facebook data scandal highlighted the potential risks of transferring people's data to third parties, but there remains precious little regulation or transparency when it comes to data collection, retention and use.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The legislation on data is a long way behind the technology itself,&quot; said Asif. &quot;We were often audited, and there were strict regulations on advertisements, but there was never any oversight on data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are no safeguards to stop advertisers putting an email list with hundreds of thousands of people's data on a USB and taking it with them when they finish a contract.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Information Commissioner's Office points to the Data Protection Act 1998 and GDPR, which both place requirements on organisations to inform individuals about the ways in which their personal data is used.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The GDPR strengthens this right to be informed, requiring organisations to provide people with additional information, including the lawful basis for processing, the period for which data will be stored and details of any third parties that will receive the data,&quot; an ICO spokesperson said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elsewhere, there are plans to geolocate customers in order to identify when they arrive at stadiums so they can prompted via texts to bet on the game they are about to watch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The gambling industry earned&pound;14bn in 2016, &pound;4.5bn of which from online betting, and it is pumping some of that money into making its products more sophisticated and, in effect, addictive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's no surprise that these companies are investing as much as they are into these sorts of algorithms to supposedly detect people who may be at risk of developing gambling problems, because the exact same technology allows them to market to people very effectively,&quot; said Nick.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's not a benign move on the part of operators, and although I wouldn't say it is a cynical ploy, there are clearly huge commercial benefits from this sort of investment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokesperson for the Campaign for Fairer Gambling said: &quot;Big Data is being cynically exploited by the gambling industry to target vulnerable consumers. So the Gambling Commission's trust in operators to use customer data for social responsibility purposes is na&iuml;ve at best.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mark Etches, chief executive of GambleAware, a gambling-related harm charity, said: &quot;Gambling advertising can be anywhere from TV screens, to social media, to mobile phone apps, and it can be hard for people at risk of developing a gambling problem to ignore the overload of messages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We hope all gambling companies put a similar level of commitment and resources behind promoting safer gambling and the help available at BeGambleAware.org as they do their own products.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Some names have been changed to protect identities.                   </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Six in 10 Brits have posted something online they've later come to regret, it has emerged. Researchers found our desire to keep friends, colleagues and relatives up to date with every aspect of our lives comes at a cost.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, 47 per cent wish they could permanently delete aspects of their digital past due to fears of it being used in ways they didn't intend. Credit history, embarrassing photos and ghosts of their dating past are among the top things Brits would like completely removed from online archives amid concerns about their privacy, security and how it might affect their future.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nick Taylor, managing director of Accenture Security, which commissioned the research, said: &quot;In May, new [data protection] regulations will give everyone in the UK the right for their online data to be forgotten. Individuals will have the power to decide which businesses can store and use their personal data, and ask companies to delete any information they have about them. In the past, consumers have voted with their wallets; now they can also vote with their data.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The study of 2,000 adults also found almost one in 10 think about wanting to erase their online past every single day, with another one in five pondering the same thought weekly. More than one quarter named their teenage years as the period of their lives they would most like to remove from their online history, with 17 per cent wanting to erase their university years. And 23 per cent said the window into their life outside of work is what they would most like to remove from their digital record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result, seven in 10 think UK residents should have the 'right to be forgotten' when it comes to their social media or online data. More than half of Brits don't feel completely comfortable with retailers storing their personal data, with an equal number feeling the same about utility companies. Three in 10 are uncomfortable with banks storing their data, and seven in 10 feel uneasy at the thought of social media businesses saving their information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Twenty-seven per cent even admitted they are on edge due to the data the NHS keeps about them and 41 per cent said the same about their personal information which is kept by their employer. Just under two in five are concerned about how their digital history might cause them to lose out on a job or how it might be used against them in future. And more than half feel unsettled by the fact there could be information about themselves lurking on the internet which they can't delete.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because of this, 68 per cent find themselves worrying about the security of their personal data which has either been shared online or stored digitally. But the results found it was no surprise many are fretting about how their digital data might be used, given the average adult spends five hours and 11 minutes a day online.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Worries about online insecurity also means just three in 10 recognise the rewards which could come from companies tracking their digital history, including personalised discounts, loyalty schemes and quicker payment processes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Taylor added: &quot;This research shows many people don't fully believe companies will always do the right thing with their personal information and so businesses clearly have a job to do to build digital trust. They worry about security and privacy and don't see the benefits of companies collecting and using their data, like personalised services and discounts. The new GDPR regulations present an opportunity for companies to prove themselves, deepen digital trust and do more, not less, with consumer data.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Twitter sold data to the Cambridge University researcher who harvested millions of Facebook users' private information without their consent.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The social media site confirmed this week it sold public data to Dr Aleksandr Kogan, who created tools that allowed the political consultancy firm Cambridge Analytica to psychologically profile and target voters using Facebook user data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Kogan's firm GSR gathered a 'random sample' of public tweets after it paid for one day of access in 2015, Twitter said - years before the recent scandal emerged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The academic insisted he had not violated Twitter's policies and the information had only been used to build 'brand reports' and 'survey extender tools'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, concerns remain that GSR could theoretically have correlated Facebook and Twitter data to build up more complete digital profiles of users.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scroll down for video</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest revelation comes from a report by the Sunday Telegraph &nbsp;which notes that data sales make up 13 per cent of Twitter's total revenue.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most tweets are public but Twitter charges companies to collect them in bulk for research purposes.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Large numbers of tweets can help firms to gauge public opinion or receptiveness to certain products or ideas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Twitter bans companies from using the data to glean sensitive information about political views or race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also prohibits linking your public tweets to personal information derived from other sources, such as your Facebook profile data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement, Twitter said the tweets accessed by GSR covered a five-month period from December 2014 to April 2015.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company insisted GSR did not access any private data about people who use Twitter.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The social media giant&nbsp;said it bans companies from 'inferring or deriving sensitive information like race or political affiliation, or attempts to match a user's Twitter information with other personal identifiers' and that it had staff in place to police this 'rigorously'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Concerns, however, remain over how the firm can be sure that this policy is enforced.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Twitter says it has now&nbsp; removed Cambridge Analytica and related parties as advertisers.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Twitter has also made the policy decision to off-board advertising from all accounts owned and operated by Cambridge Analytica,' it said in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'This decision is based on our determination that Cambridge Analytica operates using a business model that inherently conflicts with acceptable Twitter Ads business practices.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Cambridge Analytica spokesperson said the firm used Twitter for political advertising but claimed it had never 'undertaken a project with GSR focusing on Twitter data and Cambridge Analytica has never received Twitter data from GSR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It added that 'Cambridge Analytica is a data-driven marketing agency and does not 'manipulate political views'.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ilia Kolochenko, CEO of web security company High-Tech Bridge, said the EU's new data privacy regulations set to come into force next month will prevent future data scandals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: 'Some experts are concerned about potential over-regulation with the upcoming enforcement of GDPR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'However, exactly such incidents may well justify severe regulation of the personal data market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Twitter, for example, has already adjusted its Terms of Service and Privacy to comply with the new European regulations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'On the other side, users of all free services should clearly understand that social networks are not charities, and have to pay millions per day for their operations.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Keep in mind that all you share or write online can be used against you one day or become public.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cambridge Analytica profited from a feature that meant Facebook apps could ask for permission to access the data of your Facebook friends as well as your own.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This meant the company was able to mine the information of 87 million Facebook users even though just 270,000 people gave them permission to do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was designed to help them create software that can predict and influence voters' choices at the ballot box.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Within the United States alone, we have played a pivotal role in winning presidential races as well as congressional and state elections,' with data on more than 230 million American voters, Cambridge Analytica claims on its website. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The quiz app used by the firm to glean user information was designed by data science company Global Science Research (GSR), set up by&nbsp;Dr Kogan in 2014.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The academic told MPs on April 24&nbsp;he thought it was unlikely the Facebook data his app shared with Cambridge Analytica had been used to benefit the Trump campaign.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">BUSINESS; Version:1</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">958 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UK is facing a binary choice between a deep trading relationship with the EU or the US, according to a report from MPs on the International Trade Committee (ITC).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Efforts to drop regulations in a bid to land a quick Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the US could result in the erection of fresh trade barriers between the UK and the EU, the report claimed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An in-depth 50 page&nbsp;examination of UK-US trade relations has highlighted the likely trade offs for the UK in securing an US FTA. Trying to build a closer relationship with the UK's largest single-country trade partner could increase the size of the UK economy by 0.35pc of GDP but like all deal it would require &quot;trade offs&quot;, the report warned.&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UK exports to the US were worth &pound;100bn in 2016, compared with &pound;234bn to the EU &nbsp;in 2016,&nbsp;making any such trade off a difficult economic balancing act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A range of experts told MPs there was a&nbsp;&quot;binary choice&quot; to either stay aligned with EU standards or shift to&nbsp;secure a trade deal with the US by aligning the UK with the US's regulatory model, according to the report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whitehall 'chaos' puts the UK's Brexit trade strategy in doubt</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Committee chairman Angus MacNeil MP said: &quot;Will the UK align its regulations with the US, and risk erecting impenetrable trade barriers with our other global partners, particularly the EU? If there is a clash between the regulatory regimes of the EU and the US, which does the Government plan to prioritise?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These issues need to be worked out, not just before negotiating a deal with the US, but also before we finalise our future trading relationship with the EU.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Shanker Singham of the Institute for Economic Affairs,&nbsp;said that it was possible to find a way forward that did not restrict the UK to a binary choice.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was a matter of&nbsp;&quot;finding&nbsp;a way of having regulatory recognition inter-operationally with the European system while they are also able to inter-operate with the rest of the world&quot;, Mr Singham said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prior to all negotiations, the Government should publish a trade policy strategy &quot;which articulates its vision for how the UK will operate as an independent trading nation&quot;, the committee said.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A number of industries, including chemicals and automotive, told MPs that they would prefer the UK to keep in line with EU standards in the the future. Others, including some agricultural experts said that moving away from EU regulations could remove a &quot;barrier to innovation&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Geographical Indications (GIs) were also a considerable sticking point in an FTA with the US.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Benefits of Brexit divergence 'vastly outweighed' by costs, claims CBI</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GIs, which protect and localise the intellectual property of certain products to particular places such as Cornish Pasties and Scotch Whisky, are often extended beyond the EU via its FTAs with third countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This might have to be abandoned in a trade deal with the US, which instead operates on a trademark basis, which does offer the same level of legal protection based on location. A failure to have GIs recognised by the US could risk the status of high-value British products, therefore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In several sectors, the report highlighted a trade off between consumer prices and consumer protections in the pursuit of a trade deal with the US. While some products, such as pork, might become cheaper for UK consumers if more US meat were imported, it would also be of a potentially lower quality in terms of welfare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many US pigs are intensively reared with hormones such as Ractopamine and many foodstuffs are washed in chemicals. &nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GM goods are sold without labeling in the US. One trade expert, Dr Peter Holmes, said moving from EU regulations towards US standards could lead to a &quot;regulatory race to the bottom&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Impact assessments ought to be done before entering into any negotiations with the US&nbsp;both in terms of winners and losers by sector and also in terms of the overall impact on consumers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In terms of trade in services with the US, high levels of federalised,&nbsp;rather than nationalised, regulation make it a challenging market for a trade agreement. Individual states also often have tough rules on procurement, making it far harder for non-US firms to bid for contracts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Data, a major concern for all UK firms rushing to comply with the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), could also present headaches for US-UK trade negotiations. Once the UK leaves the EU it will require a so-called adequacy agreement from the EU on data. Otherwise data flows between the EU and the UK would have to halt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is also a concern for the future UK-US trade relationship. Currently data is allowed to move between the US and EU, under the Privacy Shield agreement. Any deal with the UK would require a separate bilateral agreement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lessons from the failed negotiations &nbsp;on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) must also be heeded prior to new steps towards UK-US deal, the report warned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TTIP included an Investor-State Dispute Settlement (ISDS). This aspect of the deal &quot;killed TTIP&quot; according to one expert Samuel Lowe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An ISDS often includes protections for investors that are embedded within trade agreements, such as the Canadian trade deal with the EU. They allow each country to bring a case against the other directly, via international law, rather than through one or&nbsp;the other's domestic courts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reason that ISDS proved so controversial during TTIP negotiations is that there would potentially be legal disputes around the public and private provision of NHS services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Government should ensure the NHS is &quot;not compromised by a UK-US FTA&quot; the report concluded. It should also ensure negotiations should not result in any provisions on intellectual property rights that could damage the NHS's&nbsp;pharmaceutical purchasing model.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WhatsApp has announced a dramatic shake-up of its messaging service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Facebook-owned chat app will no longer allow people under the age of 16 to use the messenger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The change will be made ahead of the introduction of new EU privacy laws this month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until now, WhatsApp has allowed 13 year-olds to join the messaging service - however, from May 25 and with the introduction of the new General Data Protection Regulation , it will increase for those inside the EU.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Users will need to confirm their age as part of a new terms of service in the coming weeks.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WHATSAPP</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until now, WhatsApp has allowed users aged 13 and older join its messaging service</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WhatsApp said it was not asking for any new rights to collect personal information as part of the new terms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our goal is simply to explain how we use and protect the limited information we have about you,&quot; the company said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fellow internet giants such as Facebook and Twitter have also been rolling out new terms of service ahead of the GDPR launch, in order to bring their businesses in line with the new regulations - which require clear consent from users to access their data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The regulations also give users greater powers to access and control how their data is used, and the right to have personal data erased.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WhatsApp said the update ensured it could &quot;meet the new high standards of transparency for how we protect the privacy of our users&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company said it plans to keep the over-13 age restriction in the rest of the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also confirmed it will launch a feature in the coming weeks that will enable users to download a copy of the data WhatsApp has collected on them - another requirement of GDPR.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Six in 10 Brits have posted something online they've later come to regret, it has emerged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Researchers found our desireto keep friends, colleagues and relatives up to date with every aspect of our lives comes at a cost.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, 47 per cent wish they could permanently delete aspects of their digital past due to fears of it being used in ways they didn't intend.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Credit history, embarrassing photos and ghosts of their dating past are among the top things Brits would like completely removed from online archives amid concerns about their privacy, security and how it might affect their future.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook publishes detailed list of why it will ban people</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nick Taylor, managing director ofAccenture Security, which commissioned the research, said: &quot;In May, new [data protection] regulationswill give everyone in the UK the right for their online data to be forgotten.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Individuals will have the power to decide which businesses can store and use their personal data, and ask companies to delete any information they have about them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the past, consumers have voted with their wallets; now they can also vote with their data.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The study of 2,000 adults also found almost one in 10 think about wanting to erase their online past every single day, with another one in five pondering the same thought weekly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than one quarter named their teenage years as the period of their lives they would most like to remove from their online history, with 17 per cent wanting to erase their university years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And 23 per cent said the window into their life outside of work is what they would most like to remove from their digital record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result, seven in 10 think UK residents should have the 'right to be forgotten' when it comes to their social media or online data.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than half of Brits don't feel completely comfortable with retailers storing their personal data, with an equal number feeling the same about utility companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three in 10 are uncomfortable with banks storing their data, and seven in 10 feel uneasy at the thought of social media businesses saving their information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Twenty-seven per cent even admitted they are on edge due to the data the NHS keeps about them and 41 per cent said the same about their personal information which is kept by their employer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just under two in five are concerned about how their digital history might cause them to lose out on a job or how it might be used against them in future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And more than half feel unsettled by the fact there could be information about themselves lurking on the internet which they can't delete.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because of this, 68 per cent find themselves worrying about the security of their personal data which has either been shared online or stored digitally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the results found it's no surprise many are fretting about how their digital data might be used, with the average adult spending five hours and 11 minutes a day online.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This insecurity also means just three in 10 recognise the rewards which could come from companies tracking their digital history, including personalised discounts, loyalty schemes and quicker payment processes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nick Taylor added: &quot;This research shows many people don't fully believe companies will always do the right thing with their personal information and so businesses clearly have a job to do to build digital trust.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They worry about security and privacy and don't see the benefits of companies collecting and using their data, like personalised services and discounts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The new GDPR regulations present an opportunity for companies to prove themselves, deepen digital trust and do more, not less, with consumer data.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Independent News &amp; Media (INM) has destroyed the computer tapes at the centre of a data-breach controversy that has engulfed the company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Documents filed by INM to the High Court show that on February 27 it authorised the shredding of 950 tapes, which it insists is standard practice for dealing with obsolete equipment. They were shredded by AMI Waste, a Dublin company, in an operation that lasted almost three hours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tapes, which contained the company's email archive, were removed from its headquarters in 2014 and interrogated by outside consultants on the instructions of Leslie Buckley, INM's then chairman. The operation was paid for by an offshore company controlled by Denis O'Brien, the biggest shareholder in the media group.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Evidence has emerged that the INM records were searched for references to 19 people, including journalists, former INM executives, PR advisers and two barristers who worked for the Moriarty tribunal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The searching of the tapes is being investigated by both the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement (ODCE) and the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner (DPC), which is checking whether INM's email archive was searched for O'Brien's benefit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Len O'Hagan, an INM board member since 2012, has told the High Court that the back-up tapes, including those investigated in 2014, were destroyed as part of &quot;housekeeping&quot; ahead of an EU data protection regime (GDPR) which starts in May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">O'Hagan said the INM tapes had been overwritten a number of times since 2014, so it was unclear if they would have retained &quot;useful information&quot;. He blamed the ODCE for not informing INM of its discovery last October that the tapes had been searched for a list of 19 names that appeared to have nothing to do with a cost-reduction exercise - the reason Buckley gave for having them examined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">O'Hagan said the INM board was &quot;horrified&quot; at the prospect that third parties might have had access to its records for &quot;an improper purpose&quot;. He said INM was concerned that the ODCE did not reveal what it had learnt about the data interrogation last year. In the absence of this material, it had been &quot;reasonable&quot; for the board to rely on the unequivocal explanation from its chairman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Had INM known about the data interrogation information that has been available to the ODCE for six months, I believe it would likely have ring-fenced the tapes from the GDPR exercise,&quot; O'Hagan said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;INM was not in a position to make this assessment, not being in possession of the information available to the ODCE, and at no stage did the ODCE indicate to INM that it must take steps to preserve any such material.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">O'Hagan said INM's board did not learn of the 2014 extraction of its back-up tapes, under Buckley's orders, until Robert Pitt, the media group's former chief executive, raised the issue with the ODCE last August.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ODCE has established that Blaydon, an O'Brien-controlled company, paid about (EURO)60,000 to two IT companies that carried out the data interrogation. It has now emerged that Island Capital, another company controlled by O'Brien, also played a role in the payments. Documents filed to the High Court show Island and Blaydon were used to make payments for mutual business interests of O'Brien and Buckley. Buckley resigned from INM on March 1. In an affidavit filed in the High Court, Ian Drennan, head of the ODCE, has said evidence he has uncovered casts doubt on Buckley's explanation that the INM tapes were searched to check on a services contract with a legal firm, as part of a cost-reduction drive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Drennan has accused INM of &quot;inappropriately downplaying&quot; the significance of the issue in a subsequent notification about a possible data breach to the DPC last August 24. The DPC was alerted by Michael Doorly, INM's company secretary, who is now chief executive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Doorly's letter to the DPC did not reveal that an O'Brien-controlled company had paid for the data interrogation exercise, even though this was known to INM by that stage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">INM is objecting to an ODCE application to have High Court inspectors appointed to the company to investigate concerns raised by Drennan. INM believes the DPC alone should investigate the alleged data breach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">O'Hagan also says the ODCE's concerns about breaches of market abuse regulations and the disclosure of confidential information by Buckley do not necessitate the appointment of inspectors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">O'Hagan said INM's board rejects Drennan's contention that INM breached the Protected Disclosures Act. He also says Drennan's concerns about corporate governance at INM are unfounded. &quot;There is no basis for any concern in relation to the ability of the board to manage and conduct its affairs properly and in accordance with the highest standards of corporate governance,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">O'Hagan said the appointment of inspectors to INM on the basis of Drennan's &quot;general and vague assertions would be unfair, unnecessary and disproportionate&quot;. He said it would be &quot;significantly damaging&quot; to the company. He also said the suggestion INM downplayed the data breach last August was &quot;wholly unfair&quot; because the board had relied on the account given by Buckley.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">O'Hagan said searching INM's data for details about a contract would be &quot;lawful&quot; if authorised and for a legitimate purpose. He said INM's board had &quot;assumed&quot; Buckley's account to be true but if the ODCE's evidence was accurate &quot;the board was misled&quot;. Buckley has said he will robustly defend himself against all allegations. O'Brien has not commented.</SPAN></P>

</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A US company has been using an app to gather and store private data on how thousands of British children behave at school.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parents fear ClassDojo, based in San Francisco, has harvested photos and videos from as much as 70 per cent of British schools.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company's data is stored in the US and shared with 22 third-party service providers including Facebook for 'optional social sharing' and Google for 'analytics'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another company using the data is analytics service Datadog which suffered a data breach two years ago, reports  The Times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Class Dojo says that it does not share student information with Facebook, Google or Datadog.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Teachers are reportedly using the app, which awards pupils positive and negative 'dojo' points based on their behaviour, as a means of maintaining order in the classroom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 'gamification' programme is hosted by a team of smiling cartoon monsters who guide pupils through exercises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kids receive green dojos for qualities like 'teamwork and 'creativity' and red dojos for qualities like 'disrespect'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pupil's scores can be displayed on a screen at the front of the class.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parents and students are encouraged to create their own ClassDojo accounts which enable them to track their children's behaviour at school - and view photos and videos of them remotely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But currently the company's policies do not appear to require school to ask for parents' consent if pupils do not have their own ClassDojo accounts even if the app is being used on them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US company requires school ask for parental consent before creating accounts for pupils under 13.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ClassDojo's terms state providers do not 'generally' have the right to use beyond what is necessary to assist ClassDojo./</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parents said they had only realised the app was being used in their children's schools when their children began talking about dojo points.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One mother said her five and seven-year-old children had been asked to vote on whether the school should start using the app.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lawyers told The Times the app's existing service would be in breach of data laws come May 25 after the introduction of stricter UK regulation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Experts also worried whether parents were able to give informed consent given the app's 12,000-word privacy policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ben Williamson, a lecturer in education at the University of Stirling, said: 'It's important for parents to be aware that the company holds detailed behavioural records for their children, as well as photos of their children uploaded from the classroom, and that the education technology industry is no more impervious to privacy breaches than commercial social media, finance or other public services like health.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A ClassDojo spokeswoman said: 'ClassDojo is fully compliant with all UK privacy laws, and is certified under the EU-US privacy shield. ClassDojo will be also fully compliant with GDPR when the law goes into effect on May 25.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Where we work with third parties, our users are still protected under ClassDojo's privacy policy; furthermore, any third-party service provider we work with now or in the future will be fully compliant with GDPR when the law goes into effect on May 25.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said children's data was automatically deleted 12 months after they stopped using the app.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'No part of our mission requires the collection of sensitive information, so we don't collect any. When a teacher sets up a class, we ask for the minimum information necessary to provide the service: a student's name or nickname and we assign them a cartoon avatar.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We do not sell or rent any information to any third parties.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ClassDojo, based in San Francisco, claims to have worked with 70 per cent of British schools. Teachers are using its app, which awards positive and negative &quot;dojo&quot; points to children as young as four. They get green dojos for qualities such as &quot;participation&quot;, and red dojos for offences such as &quot;disrespect&quot;.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the US company requires schools to obtain parental consent when creating student accounts for under-13s, experts told The Times they did not believe this was always informed consent, given the complexity of the terms. They said there could also be pressure on parents to go along with the school's wishes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Letters from UK schools seen by this newspaper tell parents: &quot;We have been using ClassDojo for over a week and the children love it!&quot; and &quot;Exciting and important news; our class is using Class-Dojo!

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A US company is gathering behavioural data, photos and video footage of thousands of British schoolchildren and storing it overseas, causing concern among parents and education experts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ClassDojo, based in San Francisco, claims to have worked with 70 per cent of British schools. Teachers are using its app, which awards positive and negative &quot;dojo&quot; points to children as young as four. They get green dojos for qualities such as &quot;participation&quot;, and red dojos for offences such as &quot;disrespect&quot;. Some teachers display pupils' points on a screen in the classroom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schools also encourage parents and students to create their own ClassDojo accounts, which enable parents to track their children's behaviour and view photographs, videos and journal entries uploaded by their children daily.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The data is stored in the US and some is shared with 22 third-party service providers, including Facebook and Google.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company's terms state that providers do not &quot;generally&quot; have the right to use information beyond what's necessary to assist ClassDojo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of those companies, Datadog, an analytics service, fell victim to a data breach two years ago. Other service providers include Google for &quot;analytics&quot; and Facebook for &quot;optional social sharing&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Experts have expressed scepticism about whether parents are always giving informed consent for the service and can understand the 12,000-word privacy policy. Lawyers said that the existing service would be in breach of stricter data laws, the general data protection regulation (GDPR), that come into force on May 25. The company's present policies do not appear to require schools to obtain parents' consent if pupils do not have their own ClassDojo accounts, even if their behaviour is monitored using the system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parents told The Times that the system had been introduced in their children's primary schools in England and Scotland and they only realised after their children started talking about dojo points. One mother said her children aged five and seven had been asked by the school to vote on whether to use the service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the US company requires schools to obtain parental consent when creating student accounts for under-13s, experts told The Times they did not believe this was always informed consent, given the complexity of the terms. They said there could also be pressure on parents to go along with the school's wishes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Letters from UK schools seen by this newspaper tell parents: &quot;We have been using ClassDojo for over a week and the children love it!&quot; and &quot;Exciting and important news; our class is using ClassDojo! It's a the easiest way for you to see how your child is doing at school.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ben Williamson, a lecturer in education at the University of Stirling, said: &quot;It's important for parents to be aware that the company holds detailed behavioural records for their children, as well as photos of their children uploaded from the classroom, and that the education technology industry is no more impervious to privacy breaches than commercial social media, finance or other public services like health.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am concerned that neither schools nor parents have a clear understanding of the data protection issues raised by classroom apps.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokeswoman for ClassDojo said: &quot;ClassDojo is fully compliant with all UK privacy laws, and is certified under the EU-US privacy shield. ClassDojo will be also fully compliant with GDPR when the law goes into effect on May 25.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Where we work with third parties, our users are still protected under ClassDojo's privacy policy; furthermore, any third-party service provider we work with now or in the future will be fully compliant with GDPR when the law goes into effect on May 25.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said ClassDojo automatically deleted a student's information 12 months after they stopped using the app.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No part of our mission requires the collection of sensitive information, so we don't collect any. When a teacher sets up a class, we ask for the minimum information necessary to provide the service: a student's name or nickname and we assign them a cartoon avatar. We don't ask for or receive any other information [such as] gender, no email, no phone number, no home address.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We do not sell or rent any information to any third parties. We work with independent security researchers to continually test ClassDojo's security practices, and those of any third-party partners, including extensive independent audits by world-class cybersecurity firms.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Behind the story ClassDojo allows children to share their achievements with parents and collect points that schools may reward with treats such as a pizza party or &quot;extra computer time&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     The Philosophy Chamber  An 18th-century cabinet of curiosities at Harvard University is re-created in an exhibition that looks at the history of collecting. &middot; Hunterian, Glasgow, until 15 July.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   Masterpiece of the week                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Anna and the Blind Tobit (c1630) by Rembrandt  Light and dark shape a space in this mesmerising work of art. The Biblical story of Tobit tells how he is blinded and his family reduced to poverty as a test from God. Here Tobit and his wife Anna share their suffering in a humble interior probably much like the homes of poor peasants at the time it was painted. Rembrandt sculpts the dark, soft atmosphere of the room so that the air itself seems tangible. Through this velvety chiaroscuro he suggests the blind inner world of Tobit. Is true vision optical or is it in the mind's eye? Rembrandt feels his way towards the shadowy truth. &middot; National Gallery, London</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c6">A guide to finding out everything a company knows about you</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">By Joshua Spencer</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">TECHNOLOGY INTELLIGENCE; Version:1</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">913 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Desperate to know what information companies and organisations hold about you, but unsure how to find out? A legal mechanism for discovering exactly this is already in place, and is weeks away from being strengthened under new EU laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;subject access request&quot;, created in the Data Protection Act 1998, is your right to find out what information is held about you by companies or organisations, including an employer, and get copies of it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Requests must be submitted in writing to an organisation, via email or letter, and limited only to personal data. Employees can request information on an assessment of performance at work, for instance. There are some exemptions on releasing data, however, such as information relating to trade secrets. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Currently, organisations can take 40 days to respond to a request and charge a fee of up to &pound;10, with a special rule for paper based health records which can slide up to &pound;50.&nbsp; But with the introduction of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) on May 25 2018, this will become free and the time limit for organisations to respond will be reduced to 30 days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those curious about the proliferation of their data are also currently entitled to be told whether their personal information is being processed, the reasons for that, as well as if their data will be given to any other organisations or people. Those who make requests should also be given details of the source of the data, where available.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   How does it work?                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) recommends a relatively straightforward process for obtaining your data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Step 1 - Find out who has your data                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before writing, research ahead to find the correct place to send your request to. If you don't find the right person or department, you could end up having to send the request all over again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To find out where to direct an inquiry, call the helpline of an organisation or check their website, which could include the information you need in the privacy policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Step 2 - Double-check everything                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Make sure that all the information you're after is included in your first email or letter. The cost of &pound;10 per request can be re-charged if you miss something out in your initial request. If you forget to ask, you could wait up to 40 days - just to find you need to fork out again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Step 3 - Write out a letter or email                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once you've done your research, you're ready to get hold of your data. Write to the organisation with your name, address and phone number, as well as any information used by the organisation to identify you from others of the same name, such as an account number.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within the letter or email, the ICO recommends mentioning the 40-day deadline for a response, your right to the request under the Data Protection Act 1998 and also referring to the advice that the ICO can provide to organisations. It could be worth including their website, https://ico.org.uk, or phone number at 0303 123 1113, in your request.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Step 4 &nbsp;- Be specific                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The key part of your request is including details of the specific information you require, as well as relevant dates. Examples could include asking for all emails between 'A' and 'B' between two dates, as well as CCTV footage or your personnel file from your employer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you're after how much Netflix has been keeping tabs on binge-watching this year, you could ask for &quot;all data Netflix holds on the account 'StrangerThings123' between 1/1/2018 to 26/4/2018, and who it has been passed to&quot;. You could limit that to &quot;viewing hours data&quot;, if you wanted to get more specific. If you're struggling with how to phrase anything in your letter, the ICO have a template here .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alternatively, you can ask for all data a company holds on you.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Step 5 - Follow up                    </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an ideal world, the organisation has quickly complied with your request and you now know what your boss has been saying about you on email. But it's also possible that companies won't scramble to provide you with data that they'd prefer to keep to themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For this reason, the ICO recommend following up with a further reminder of Data Protection Act obligations if no response is received within the 40 day period, which starts from the day the organisation receives the fee and the information they need to identify you. The ICO also advise keeping a copy of all correspondence involved in the process of the request.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Step 6 - Demand your data                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When a gentle nudge fails, data subjects have another method of challenging for their information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the organisation refuses or ignores the request, or has not provided all the information you asked for, individuals can appeal and report concerns to the ICO. The ICO will then work with the organisation to solve the problem and see if it has not complied with obligations - though its possible the organisation may have.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To begin an appeal, visit https://ico.org.uk/concerns/ and fill out the questions to explain the nature of your issue. Then, fill in the 'accessing personal information concerns form' and send it along with any other documents you wish to casework@ico.org.uk . Alternatively, print the form out and post it to the ICO office: Customer Contact, Information Commissioner's Office, Wycliffe House, Water lane, Wilmslow, SK9 5AF.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FACEBOOK reported a 63pc increase in quarterly profits last night as the under-pressure social media giant gave no evidence that the Cambridge Analytica row had halted its breakneck growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mark Zuckerberg's company revealed that revenues in the first quarter of 2018 had risen to $12bn (&pound;8.6bn), a 49pc increase on the same period a year earlier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The number of people using Facebook each month hit 2.2bn, surpassing analysts' expectations and suggesting the #deletefacebook campaign that followed the company's privacy row had done little to dent user numbers. Profits reached $5bn, up from $3.1bn a year ago.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook has been battling one of the biggest crises in its 14-year history since it emerged last month that millions of users had had their data compromised and obtained by Cambridge Analytica before 2015.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">87m users' private details, such as likes, religious beliefs and relationship statuses, are believed to have been collected. In response, Facebook has promised tighter controls and a thorough audit of the website, but shares have still fallen almost 15pc since the scandal broke as it has faced growing calls for regulation and resentment from parts of its user base.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, shares climbed more than 7pc in after-hours trading last night as investors breathed a sigh of relief at the company's apparent financial resilience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the results for the three months to the end of March cover only the first two weeks of the controversy, the company's chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, suggested there had been almost no impact on its advertising business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the immediate days [after the scandal broke] we heard from a handful of advertisers who paused spend, one of whom already came back,&quot; she said. &quot;We haven't seen a meaningful trend since then.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Sandberg mounted a staunch defence of the company's advertising-funded business, saying the company was &quot;proud&quot; of it, but admitted that Facebook had considered alternative revenue models such as subscriptions in the past. Facebook has promised to increase spending on securing users' data and stopped using information obtained from data brokers to target adverts, a move that analysts say could cost it billions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Despite facing important challenges, our community and business are off to a strong start in 2018,&quot; Mr Zuckerberg, the chief executive, said.&quot; We are taking a broader view of our responsibility and investing to make sure our services are used for good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were two blackspots on the company's results. David Wehner, Facebook's chief financial officer, admitted that new EU data protection laws known as the GDPR could lead to a fall in user numbers across Europe, and the company increased its forecasts for how much it would be spending on staff to address its recent criticism. Facebook declined to say if recent changes to its central news feed, which relegated the influence of pages from businesses and publishers, had led to users spending less time on the social network.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WhatsApp, the messaging app owned by Facebook, is barring children under 16 years of age from using it in Europe, because of forthcoming data protection laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Next month's GDPR laws require children aged 15 and under to receive parental permission to use internet services that process personal data, although countries including the UK are reducing this to under-13s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A WhatsApp spokesman said the app would only enforce the rule change using a simple tick-box, rather than verifying users' ages.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And that's it. The session is over, a little under five hours after it started.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">block-time published-time 3.08pm BST </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Facebook became a &quot;beast that spreads hatred against muslims&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stevens moves on to Myanmar, where Facebook has been implicated in violence against the Rohingya minority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I went to the refugee camps last November. The UN has accused Facebook of playing a role in the violence, saying social media has been exploited to spread hate speech. Just last month the UN said your platform had morphed into a 'beast' that spreads hatred against Rohingya muslims.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schroepfer says that in regions like this, &quot;where there is hate and dehumanisation in the region, the answer is to get more people on the ground who know the region, we need more policy people on the ground. We need to, and are, trying to get a lot more to get hate speech and all of this vile content off the platform.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've been working in Myanmar a long time, I don't know when exactly we decided to amp up the product teams on the ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are some challenges on the technical level. There's a language there that we don't have a lot of tools in, that's not Burmese. In this region, the goal is to have people who can respond, not just quickly, but adequately. On a technical level, the work we've done in English, we're trying to work out how to translate that into Burmese.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">block-time published-time 3.03pm BST </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jo Stevens returns to Alex Kogan, Joseph Chancellor and GSR. When did Facebook know of the links?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is possible someone in Facebook knew about this and didn't tell the rest of the organisation. 2017 is when legal, the investigation in to this, knew about it, but a recruiter may have known sooner.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stevens again asks how Facebook can take such a &quot;direct and critical&quot; line with Aleksandr Kogan but continue to ignore Joseph Chancellor. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are investigating his involvement in this now,&quot; Schroepfer says. &quot;I believe he works on virtual reality and some other things like that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I learned about much of this very recently, so that's the full situation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">block-time published-time 3.00pm BST </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Collins asks what the political ads transparency entails.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Among the things you'll see is spend, who they were trying to advertise to, and some basic information about how much it was viewed,&quot; says Schroepfer. &quot;Basically all the information you would want to know about who was advertising in an election and how.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">block-time published-time 2.57pm BST </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Collins turns to the FTC's consent decree with Facebook. Have the required audits been undertaken, he asks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They were.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why did they not catch the issues with Aleksandr Kogan's apps?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I do not know... we were looking at these issues all the time. Not just with the FTC, the Irish DPC had gone through all these issues as well.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Collins: How much data does Facebook share with governments or get from governments about citizens?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know if we do. We'll do research collaborations with aggregate data.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Collins:&quot;If I downloaded my data, would any government data be included?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scrhoepfer seems baffled by the question, uncertain what government data Collins might be referring to, but notes that Facebook's transparency reports share information about government requests for data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">block-time published-time 2.53pm BST </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Collins notes that Facebook's enforcement on what developers can do seems lax. &quot;YOu don't have a system of randomised checks or anything?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schroepfer: &quot;I think the starting point is peopl eunderstanding, is this a random game they've never heard of or a big brand like spotify.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think we need to do everything we can to inform the consumer, to police bad behaviour, ideally to review the apps before they go on to ensure there's no bad behaviour on the platforms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Part of their terms is that they're required to honour these requests we send them to delete the data.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">block-time published-time 2.50pm BST </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Collins asks about Facebook's tool to let users download their information, in compliance with GDPR. It doesn't let users download information that the company has gathered about them off the site, he notes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You can get that, I know that it's in the ads tools, it might be part of the DYI tools, I think. We're trying to show it as we use it.&quot; In other words, it won't contain a list of sites you've visited, but might contain a list of things Facebook has worked out from your browsing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Collins asks if you can get that information if you don't have a Facebook account, and Schroepfer says no, because the company doesn't know who you are. Collins asks if you could ask for information gathered from a specific device, which Facebook does know, and Schroepfer says you still can't, because &quot;I have no way to verify with you that that's actually your device.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are challenging issues here because we're not storing information about you, just about your device.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Collins says he is pretty confident that refusal will lead to some legal test cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">block-time updated-timeUpdated at 2.50pm BST</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">block-time published-time 2.44pm BST </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jo Stevens points out that Facebook promoted Stephen Milner to Vice President in March, following his testimony to the committee. Schroepfer says that sort of promotion isn't unusual.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">block-time published-time 2.43pm BST </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A final question from Matheson: &quot;is it possible that Facebook could attach a 'little rider' to every video uploaded to Facebook to say who the original uploader was? If I uploaded a video onto Facebook you could upload something saying that it was first uploaded by Chris Matheson?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schroepfer notes it would be possible, but may not be the most important aspect of advertising transparency. &quot;Your general idea of providing much more information about the source is right.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Matheson: It just strikes me that if someone's name has to be attached to a new advert or story, it's likely to be more legal, honest, open and truthful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">block-time published-time 2.39pm BST </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Matheson begins to ask about Vote Leave's ad campaign on Facebook, but Schroepfer cuts him off, saying it's likely to be easier to answer detailed questions in writing. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My understanding is that Aggregate IQ was the advertiser of record, so they were the ones paying for the advertising.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Matheson says he would also like to know what the adverts were, how much was spent, and whether it's possible to know to whom they were sent, and how that was decided.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schroepfer thinks he can provide some of that information. Matheson notes that Facebook has already made that promise, in February in Washington, and never followed up. Schroepfer apologises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">block-time published-time 2.34pm BST </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Matheson asks about the fraudulent adverts in Martin Lewis' name that Facebook shut down. Schroepfer doesn't know what happened to the money those advertisers paid, whether it was returned or kept.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I understand what you're getting at,&quot; Schroepfer says, &quot;but trust me, we are motivated to get these ads off the platform. Our ability to get all of it down immediately is technically challenging.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">block-time published-time 2.32pm BST </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chris Matheson asks why Facebook didn't write to the committee to correct the record from Simon Milner's statement. Schroepfer says he hopes his appearance helps fix some of those issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">block-time published-time 2.31pm BST </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Collins breaks the news to Schroepfer - and me - that Mark Zuckerberg has agreed to give evidence to the European Parliament, while the committee has been ongoing. &quot;We still do need the opportunity to put some of these questions to him,&quot; said Collins.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What has frustrated us has been a pattern of behaviour, an unwillingness to engage. When we asked Facebook if it would investigate on the same terms that it had in America, it refused to do so and then changed its mind. When we had our session in Washington we asked... expressly about data breaches. We since learned that the company knew an awful lot more than it told us, and we wouldn't have learned any of that if it hadn't been for investigative journalists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I hope you understand that Mr Lucas' line of questioning reflects a frustration of many of us. I don't think anyone looking at those transcripts from February would feel we were given straight answers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">block-time published-time 2.26pm BST </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm doing my best to get the answers to you,&quot; Schroepfer says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lucas replies: &quot;You are, but the buck doesn't stop with you does it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, it stops with Mark.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Why won't Mr Zuckerberg come to us and answer the questions?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He is trying to dedicate his time, in the office, to solving these problems. I'm trying to do my best to answer the questions. We thought, given you wanted to go into fake news, about our plans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What we want is the truth. We didn't get the truth back in February. There are millions of our constituents who are concerned about this. Don't you think the right thing to do would be for him to come to us and explain why someone representing Facebook didn't tell us the whole truth back in February?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know what he knew or didn't know. I don't know the specifics of it. I will do my best to tell you about these topics. That's the best I can do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mr Schroepfer, you have a head of integrity? I remain unconvinced that your company has integrity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">block-time updated-timeUpdated at 2.27pm BST</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">block-time published-time 2.22pm BST </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I think Facebook concealed the truth from us in February.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ian Lucas hands Schroepfer some evidence Facebook gave the DCMS committee in February, at a session in Washington DC. It's the transcript of a conversation between Chris Matheson and Simon Milner, a Facebook VP, in which Milner denies that Cambridge Analytica had any Facebook data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The reason we have re-opened this, as we all learned this month, is that there's allegations Cambridge Analytica kept this data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At the time, this was accurate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lucas disputes this, noting that in December 2015, Facebook was well aware that there had been a &quot;data breach&quot; that precipitated action. &quot;Why did you not tell this committee about this when you gave us evidence in February? You had very specific knowledge as a company, in February, of what happened in this case. Why did you not tell us? Do you think that Mr Milner should have told us about the agreement between Cambridge Analytica and Facebook?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think Facebook concealed the truth from us in February.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schroepfer disagrees, arguing that Milner is an &quot;honest man&quot; who likely told the committee what he believed to be true at the time. &quot;I'm guessing he didn't know.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">block-time published-time 2.12pm BST </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A question from Ian Lucas, Labour, about who owns information on Facebook, veers into interesting territory quickly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schroepfer begins by trotting out rubric about how you own everything you post to Facebook, but when asked about information Facebook gathers about non-users browsing off the site, he concedes that that user has no control over that data. &quot;Even if you wanted to delete the data, we wouldn't know it was you, so we couldn't.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lucas asks &quot;Is that information of value to Facebook?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For security purposes, absolutely,&quot; says Schroepfer. &quot;If you made us turn it off, it would be devastating to our ability to detect fake accounts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">block-time updated-timeUpdated at 2.23pm BST</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">block-time published-time 2.07pm BST </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">O'Hara asks whether data will be transferred out of the EU following GDPR. Schroepfer says yes, it will, that's how Facebook works, and promises to be compliant with GDPR. &quot;We are excited to be in compliance with every EU citizen, no matter where the compute capacity is.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in fact many of the basics of GDPR are also being rolled out for the rest of the world. The series of screens we've developed for GDPR are being rolled out to other regions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">O'Hara asks why, if that's the case, Facebook transferred 1.5bn accounts from Ireland to the US.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've got clear feedback from people in other regions that they would prefer to work with a local regulator to work with issues in those regions. By moving to the US, the US doesn't have a lead regulator, which opens up the possibility for local regulators to lead on their own country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">block-time published-time 2.03pm BST </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">O'Hara asks how Facebook finds out information from browsing off site.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you're not a Facebook user, we don't find out things like name and so on, just basic log information,&quot; Schroepfer says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a use for third parties. For instance, the like button is useful as a share button. One of the important users is understanding fake accounts - have we seen this browser before, does it have a real pattern of behaviour?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">block-time published-time 1.57pm BST </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">O'Hara asks if the app review team is large enough to catch future issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have challenges getting enough resources we need to deal with all the threats on the platform,&quot; says Schroepfer. &quot;My core job is to get the best AI researchers across the world. If you picked any area and asked do I want to hire more, I would say yes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">O'Hara: how will you ensure that the audit of other apps will be complete? How will you audit apps that have since shut down?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We may not always have perfect information on all of these things,&quot; says Schroepfer &quot;but the issue gets to the heart of what you're raising: let's not wait for somebody else to bring this to light.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're going as fast as we can.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">block-time published-time 1.55pm BST </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You're asking us to believe that nobody in the entire organisation saw this crisis coming, between 2014 and now,&quot; says O'Hara incredulously.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schroepfer says Facebook has had a &quot;change in security posture&quot; since then, which should leave the company more able to catch future crises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When asked if Facebook was slow to act because it was profitable not to, Schroepfer points out that &quot;we don't charge money for the platform.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What I can do is spend our time... doing all the work we can to dramatically reduce the probability that this happens again in the future.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">block-time published-time 1.51pm BST </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">O'Hara argues that Facebook &quot;could not have been unaware of this looming crisis. You tinkered around the. edges in 2011, you tinkered again in 2014... did nobody say there is a crisis unless we fundamentally change what we do?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schroepfer highlights the fact that, just recently, when Facebook tightened up its platform last month, it broke a number of apps ( such as Tinder ), arguing that that is why the company was wary of acting. Nonetheless, he says, if they had known then what they know now - that he would be testifying to Parliament about election interference - he agrees they would have done differently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, he says, Facebook is more actively trying to work out what problems lie in the future. &quot;Let's make it as Conservative and locked-down as we can, to avoid future issues.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">O'Hara points out that Parakilis warned Facebook management in 2012 that the company's platform should be locked down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">block-time published-time 1.45pm BST </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SNP MP Brendan O'Hara picks up on Schroepfer's admission that Facebook didn't check the terms and conditions developers were offering to users. &quot;The terms and conditions are an important part,&quot; Schroepfer says, &quot;but there's much broader questions to ask about what data that app is asking for, to make sure there isn't an over reach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The shift that happened [in 2014] was one that moved from user choice to more proactive review.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Knowing what we know now, I wish we had done more there at the time,&quot; Schroepfer adds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">block-time published-time 1.42pm BST </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Collins asks Schroepfer to elaborate in comments made in his written statement about the investigation into Aggregate IQ and Cambridge Analytica. He declines to elaborate, but here is the relevant section from the written statement:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are grateful to the UK's Information Commissioner's Office for their diligent work in investigating the Cambridge Analytica issue. We fully support their work and are providing help and assistance in order that they can complete their work as quickly as possible. This includes technical support where helpful, as well as providing them with information that will be of assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They have asked us a number of questions about Cambridge Analytica, as well as AggregateIQ (&quot;AIQ&quot;), and their connection to the 2016 Referendum, and I know this Committee has also investigated these matters. My team and I met with the Information Commissioner's Office this week to update them on our internal investigations, and I wanted to share with you a short summary of the information we have provided them and also the Electoral Commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&middot; Cambridge Analytica - We did not find any referendum related ads or pages on Facebook directly managed by Cambridge Analytica or SCL Group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&middot; Aggregate IQ - Our records show that AIQ spent approximately $2M USD on ads from pages that appear to be associated with the 2016 Referendum. We have provided details on the specific campaigns and related spending to the ICO and Electoral Commission. In the course of our ongoing review, we also found certain billing and administration connections between SCL/Cambridge Analytica and AIQ. We have shared that information with ICO for the purposes of their investigation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">block-time published-time 1.38pm BST </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Collins notes that in 2014, when Facebook tightened up its privacy settings, it must have had some mis-uses that prompted that decision. Schroepfer says he doesn't know about any specific examples. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">block-time published-time 1.36pm BST </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Collins asks about the investigation that Facebook is running into other apps which may have been harvesting information at the same time as CA was. Schroepfer says he has no updates, but commits to informing &quot;all the relevant parties&quot; if anything is uncovered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Collins follows up by asking, again, about former Facebook employee Sandy Parakilis, who says he expressed significant concern about Facebook's data giveaways at the time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was a lot of focus on giving people clear controls at the time,&quot; Schroepfer says. &quot;I think a lot of the idealism was that with good developers and informed consumers, it would work, but as we have seen, that wasn't enough.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Collins asks if there are any preliminary results from the investigation, and Schroepfer declines to answer. &quot;It takes time to understand what's happened here, with other developers,&quot; the exec says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Collins follows up asking if Facebook has sent letters asking developers to destroy data, similar to those it sent to CA, to any other developers. Schroepfer says he doesn't know about that fact.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A core problem with consumer data, in general, is that once it gets in someone's hands, you can't easily delete it. This is why we have moved, and the future here is in proactive enforcement. Figuring out how to provide consumers with control over their data, how to make the platform much more restrictive about the data it provides.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Collins returns to the questions about Joseph Chancellor, Aleksandr Kogan's erstwhile colleague. Chancellor was asked about his work at GSR during his interview with Facebook, Collins, says, suggesting that maybe Facebook did know about that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Collins also asked how Facebook can claim to be outraged by Kogan's actions, but still employ Chancellor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is possible he discussed his employment at GSR,&quot; Schroepfer concedes. But he notes that Chancellor wasn't involved in the 2015 Guardian reporting.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schroepfer says Facebook's lawyers will reconfirm that, and provides more detail about Facebook's communications with Kogan and Cambridge Analytica.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schroepfer also returns to the questioning from Collins back at the start, about political affiliation: you can't target adverts on political affiliation, Schroepfer clarifies, and you have to specifically opt in to share that information.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Watling asks the initial intent for building the data access that GSR used to harvest data for Cambridge Analytica.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The intent was to allow developers to build experiences&quot; such as multiplayer games, communal music players, and the like, &quot;and allow people to take their data to these experiences,&quot; Schroepfer says. &quot;We said, people are smart... our job is to make sure that they understand what is happening.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">block-time published-time 12.58pm BST </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Watling brings up former Facebook manager Sandy Parakilas's claim that Facebook is an &quot;addictive product&quot;. Schroepfer says people like Facebook, to which Watling notes that people like cigarettes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you develop an addictive product, you can sell it to advertisers, because people will continue coming back,&quot; the MP says. &quot;People can't put it down, that's part of the system. You place a post, and 15 minutes later you need to see if they've reacted.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our goal is to build products that are good,&quot; Schroepfer says. He brings up Facebook's desire to encourage active use of the site, rather than passive scrolling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">block-time published-time 12.55pm BST </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Giles Watling, Conservative, describes the social media industry as being dragged blinking into the light, and asks Schroepfer if they're now playing catch-up to the real issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Would you agree that you're behind the curve, and playing catchup? And that you're not willing to go there, you're having to be pulled there?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schroepfer says &quot;we were slow, because we didn't understand the threat at the time. I can't fix that back then, but I can devote my time and energy to two things: one is, with the specific acts, we build every defence we can... and then two, we do a deeper more rigorous forward looking... proactive defence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Watling asks how Facebook divides what people can and can't put on the platform.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schroepfer notes that on Tuesday, Facebook published its internal guidelines (a year after the Guardian published leaked versions of the same documents). &quot;One of the things we've said is a challenge here is understanding exactly where the lines are on these things... the right approach is to be a lot more engaging on where that line should be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People who are using the products should have a much bigger say... I've had people tell me we're too prudish, too restrictive, and others tell me it's offensive what we allow. It's a product for free expression... but there have to be some basic rules.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chris Matheson, Labour, asks: &quot;I get friend requests from attractive young women, with no friends in common. One explanation might be that they admire my work in Westminster and Chester. Another might be that despite the fact that I'm an overweight middle age bloke they like what they see.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let's assume that they are fake accounts. If I allowed my vanity to get the better of my judgement, what advantage would accrue to the person who controls the fake account?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schroepfer notes the accounts are frequently just &quot;straight up financial scams&quot;. &quot;This is again, finding and removing this sort of account, is one of the most important things we can do. You can report the account as a likely fake account.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Matheson asks how many fake accounts there are. &quot;I know that we report this on a regular basis, I think it's on the order of a few percent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Matheson asks about a specific &quot;purge&quot; of fake accounts in April 2017, and whether that purge was related to the US election. Schroepfer can't answer detailed questions on that issue, and warns that the company may not have detailed logs for that period. &quot;We purge accounts on a regular basis, but I don't know the specific details of this.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These are all really hard problems,&quot; Schroepfer says, &quot;but I can tell you the really hard problems aren't about money. When you say things like 'don't have divisive advertising', finding exactly what that means is challenging to get right at scale, and we want to make sure we're very clearly not censoring.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't want to paper over that these are real issues. I understand the skepticism, I don't fault you for it. If you're asking me a question of intent, I can only tell you what's in my heart, which is that we do really care about these things.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Farrelly asks about &quot;embeds&quot; - Facebook staffers who sit with a campaign providing regular advice on how to use the platform. Schroepfer again claims to not know about the term, but agrees that the practice is common.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We don't want divisive ads on the platform,&quot; he says. &quot;We do want people to run effective ads, because it is effective for them, small businesses and others.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Farrelly repeats his request for the specific adverts Cambridge Analytica and AIQ ran on the platform, before asking whether the embeds make Facebook active political players, rather than just a neutral platform.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are trying to offer our services to any customer of ours... we have never turned away a political party because we don't want them to win an election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I believe in strong, open political discourse. I don't think it's for us to decide who the right candidate is, it's for the people. So in the sense that we will equally support all legitimate candidates in a democratic election, yes, we do.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paul Farrelly asks when Facebook will bring its ad registry to India. &quot;I don't know the timescale,&quot; says Schroepfer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Can Facebook make available a searchable archive of the materials Cambridge Analytica and Aggregate IQ have produced for previous elections? &quot;It's difficult to do this retrospectively, we don't have all this data.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Farrelly moves on to dark advertising - the term for Facebook ads that can only be seen by the recipient. &quot;It's great interest for those of us who are not the target of these adverts to see how subtly they may have been changed, the facts might have been changed, and what they were saying to different audiences,&quot; the MP says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was reported that dark advertising was used in the US elections to try and dissuade African Americans from voting,&quot; Farrelly says, asking to hear more about that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schroepfer says he doesn't know what Farrelly means by dark advertising, so Farrelly defines the term (by googling it on his iPad). Schroepfer says the tool the company is rolling out, that lets a user look up historical logs of adverts, will help.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're about 6% of the global advertising market,&quot; Schroepfer says, but &quot;it is not something we track, we have no goals on the political advertising market. The only numbers we do know are the relative percentage of political ad revenue, but even at the peak during elections are a low single digit percentage.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It hasn't been my experience that it's 14 clicks, but it's a very fair question. Our teams are doing extensive user testing, to try to build them so they're easy to use and powerful.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Is it possible we missed something, yes. I do think we looked pretty hard.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elliott turns to spending from AggregateIQ, a Canadian company that worked the Brexit campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We looked at that company and found that they had spent $2m on the Brexit referendum in 2016,&quot; Schroepfer says. &quot;I believe it was [declared] but I haven't looked at that detail.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Is it possible, because there are alleged links between Cambridge Analytica and AggregateIQ, we wanted to follow the data to see if the data was used in other elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The campaigns they [AIQ] run were based on email lists... Mr Kogan's app did not get email addresses from either the installer of the app or their friends. And the people they advertise to, the overlap between that and the Digital Life app was 3-4%. Basically this is a random overlap, so they are clearly not using that data.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Knight points out that Facebook brings up &quot;self&quot; regulation a lot. &quot;Do you think the time has come for robust regualtion and empowerment of consumers over their own information?

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schroepfer: &quot;I agree 100% that consumers need control... part of the issue of the platform is that we made it easy for people to take their data to third party developers and then abuses ensued. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In terms of regulation, there are multiple laws that we are under the guise of right now. GDPR comes into effect this month.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schroepfer says &quot;I respectfully disagree with that assessment.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Farrelly points out the year's grace that existing Facebook developers had when the company tightened up its rules.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The reason we did this is that these changes were significant enough that if we had flipped the switch immediately, we would have broken a large portion of the internet,&quot; Schroepfer says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That grace period was a key competitive advantage for Kogan, whose GSR app was grandfathered in to the old rules at the time he was dealing with Cambridge Analytica - even if the company had wanted, it wouldn't have been able to gain that access itself.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When the Guardian was working on the stories in 2015 and in 2018, were you aware that Joseph Chancellor was a co-founder of GSR? Have you investigated the word he was doing?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you intend to take any legal action against the University of Cambridge?&quot; Schroepfer again says no legal actions are being prepared, as Facebook waits for the ICO investigation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schroepfer explains that bad actors &quot;keep running ads, and they get blocked and blocked, until they get round the blocks... Mr Lewis reported about 50 ads, and using those we found thousands of adverts, and took them down.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The second issue you raised, about transparency, is an important one. In June, you'll basically be able to see every running ad on the platform. We don't want people to have to be the ones looking out for bad adverts, we want the vast majority of this stuff to be caught by automated systems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ninety percent of the nudity on the platform is flagged by automated systems... that's the future we want to get to.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Collins asks why Facebook doesn't use the facial recognition technology it already has to block all adverts with Lewis' face. &quot;We are investigating ways to do that,&quot; says Schroepfer. &quot;It is challenging to do at scale.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is why, for instance, we looked at the hype around cryptocurrencies... we banned the whole category, because we thought the likelihood of harm to consumers was high.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Collins pushes on facial recognition: &quot;You've got facial recognition on users and can automatically tag them in pictures.&quot; Schroepfer argues that adverts are different from photos, apparently in the difference between how each is affected by false positives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Collins: &quot;A lot of the tools seem to work for the advertiser, not for the consumer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">block-time published-time 11.16am BST </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Collins discusses the &quot;Damascene conversion&quot; that Mark Zuckerberg and others have undergone over fake news in the last few months, but argues that their words haven't been met with actions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The combination of the news feed and targeted advertising... is the pipe through which the fake news comes, and there doesn't seem to be that much you can do to control it,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think the evolution that's happened over time is we've realised the platform can be abused by bad actors,&quot; Schroepfer replies. &quot;My primary job back at home is to build our technological systems, build REI and ML technologies... that have been immensely successful at reducing the bad actors across Facebook.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">block-time published-time 11.14am BST </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Collins moves on to the News Feed. &quot;Do you think there's a case that political advertising shouldn't be in the News Feed at all?&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is not an issue of revenue for us,&quot; Schroepfer replies. &quot;What we know is that advertising is a critical way to reach audiences. Those who don't have an established name, who are running for new offices, the ability to reach people via pages and via advertising is a powerful tool for free speech.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Transparency is important... and saying we would just cut people off from access would do harm.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Collins suggests that Facebook could put paid adverts in a different feed, like the &quot;Explore feed&quot; experiment the company launched late last year. (When Facebook launched that experiment, it also moved journalism into the secondary feed, prompting reporters in the six affected countries to declare the test &quot; downright orwellian &quot;.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schroepfer notes that adverts are easier to ignore, and less disruptive, if they're integrated in to the News Feed and similar features. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">block-time published-time 11.09am BST </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The biggest weapon we've found in this defence is to find the actor, find the account, and take it down. The root cause is identifying that the actor is someone like the IRA, and take it down,&quot; Schroepfer says, &quot;get them off the platform as quickly as possible.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In case this is getting confusing, the IRA in this context is the Internet Research Agency, the Russian &quot;troll army&quot; that intervened in the US election in an attempt to sow discord and misinformation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">block-time published-time 11.07am BST </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Collins: &quot;The reason the IRA case is interesting to us is that it's the most exposed, and we want to know how to recognise similar activity in the UK.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schroepfer: &quot;We did look for connections between the Russian IRA and the Brexit election, we found $1 of spend... almost nothing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Collins: &quot;We don't know if it happened, but if it did happen, it must have happened in another way, that's what we know.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schroepfer: &quot;I can't prove a negative.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">block-time published-time 11.04am BST </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Transparency is good, and helpful, but all this would mean is that the Russians in St Petersburg would just have to find a different office,&quot; Collins points out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I 100% agree with you, that political ads are different,&quot; Schroepfer replies. &quot;What happend in 2016, with the Russian IRA, was awful... the key weapon in that is to find out the actors. The problem here is that they were masquerading as citizens of the USA on the site.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What we are doing now is proactively looking for actors on the site... that's an issue that is of great importance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Collins points out that the first Russians who were found were even paying in Rubles for political ads. &quot;Why wasn't that found, that was against US political law?&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schroepfer says &quot;look, I am way more disappointed in this than you are&quot;, eliciting a mumbled retort from another MP on the committee and an apology from the executive. &quot;I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">block-time published-time 11.00am BST </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schroepfer now bringing up his promises for change in time for the 2019 election. You can read more about them here, from when Facebook announced them earlier this month. A snippet:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook is stepping up its efforts to fight fake news and political misinformation, with new controls intended to ensure authenticity and transparency among advertisers and publishers on the site.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote in a post shortly after the moves were announced: &quot;These steps by themselves won't stop all people trying to game the system. But they will make it a lot harder for anyone to do what the Russians did during the 2016 election and use fake accounts and pages to run ads.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The measures build on a plan, announced last October, to require American political advertisers to undergo an authentication process and reveal their affiliation alongside their adverts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">block-time updated-timeUpdated at 11.00am BST</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">block-time published-time 10.58am BST </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schroepfer: &quot;Advertisers have limited budgets, and want to spend those budgets well. When I as a user take all these [interests] out, the only way they'll reach me is with a broad campaign, more like a TV campaign, which is quite expensive per person.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If there's a broad campaign running, and something more local, like a coffee shop near to me, you're likely to get the local one&quot;, because it's more relevant to you than the broad one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pair have now been at loggerheads over this for fifteen minutes: Collins wants to know why it is that a user who explicitly says they don't want to be targeted over a certain political issue can still get adverts for that issue, and Schroepfer has nothing to offer other than noting that users can opt out of certain types of ad targeting, but can't opt out of ad content.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">block-time published-time 10.55am BST </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Collins asks if Facebook is complying with privacy laws. Schroepfer, unsurprisingly, thinks it is.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Collins: &quot;If a political advertiser wishes to upload a custom audience to Facebook&quot; - a feature that lets advertisers upload mailing lists and the like to advertise to those users on Facebook - &quot;does Facebook have any way of checking those users gave consent?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schroepfer says that the advertiser has to affirm that they have consent. &quot;We don't actually see the data ... we don't get the emails in raw form. We can't reverse it, to see the email in raw form, and we don't store the data. We couldn't validate it if we wanted to, and so it is a requirement that the person who acquired that mailing list have consent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Collins again asks whether a person who had opted out of political advertising might receive those adverts through the custom audience feature, and Schroepfer again notes that you can't exactly opt out of political advertising.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; I want to be clear,&quot; the Facebook executive says, &quot;there isn't an opt out of political advertising.&quot; Instead, you can only opt out of the information that is used to target ads - and if an advertiser targets broadly enough, then it may hit you in general.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's no specific category by category opt outs,&quot; Schroepfer says. &quot;When I mute an ad from an advertiser, I don't see an ad from them again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Collins points out &quot;there are thousands of pages, with thousands of adverts... that's a very weak tool for the user.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">block-time published-time 10.48am BST </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Guardian's Media Editor Jim Waterson notes that Twitter, the company, is loving this.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">block-time published-time 10.47am BST </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Political advertising can be based partly on people's metadata trail on Facebook itself, is that correct,&quot; asks Collins. &quot;My metadata from Facebook can be used to put me in a category where I might receive political advertising, correct?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schroepfer replies that things like Facebook pages may be used, but not Facebook postings. &quot;If I liked a page about immigration, for instance, that may be used to target you with adverts... we don't scan posts for advertising data.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Collins brings up offsite tracking, and Schroepfer agrees that when users visit pages with a Facebook like button, Facebook can see that - and points out that Collins' own website has such a button.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Schroepfer doesn't address the Facebook Pixel, another form of off-site tracking which is far less visible to web surfers).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Collins asks how many websites have Facebook tracking information, but Schroepfer doesn't know the answer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">block-time published-time 10.43am BST </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Collins picks up on the claim that users can control what ads they receive: &quot;If my ad preferences stated that I didn't want to receive political advertising, can you guarantee I wouldn't?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schroepfer clarifies that no, you can't, you can simply opt out of the reasons why that advertising might be targeted to you.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was referring to the ads preferences... but if you see any advertisement, you can declare that you don't want to see anything from that advertiser again, which is a feature you absolutely don't have on a newspaper or a television.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Collins disputes that, saying that adverts come from so many entities that it would be impractical to block them all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schroepfer replies: &quot;We're actually going to mark all political ads prior to the 2019 local elections, and explain who paid for them, and provide a lot more transparency. It's an important issue.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">block-time published-time 10.40am BST </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Collins begins with an odd pair of questions: how much Schroepfer spent on his car, and how large his home is. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schroepfer doesn't know, but Collins notes that Facebook does know the answers to those questions, and others. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Facebook gathers that information, those are categories of information that Facebook gathers about users,&quot; Collins says. &quot;Why does Facebook gather that data about its users?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schroepfer answers that he's checked his advertising preferences recently - which anyone can do - and didn't see anything about his car or home there. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The basis of our service, the thing we provide, is a way to provide personalised experiences. When I log in to Facebook, the thing I get is a personalised news feed. The feedback we get from people, over and over again, is that when we give them things that aren't relevant to them, that's the worst form of experience.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">block-time published-time 10.36am BST </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While we wait for the hearing to begin, the committee has released Schroepfer's written evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I want to start by echoing our CEO, Mark Zuckerberg,&quot; he writes. &quot;What happened with Cambridge Analytica represents a breach of trust, and we are deeply sorry. We made mistakes and we are taking steps to make sure it doesn't happen again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You'll be able to read the whole statement here when it's published.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">block-time published-time 9.47am BST </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schroepfer won't have an easy ride from MPs, who are smarting at the fact that they've been fobbed off with one of Mark Zuckerberg's deputies rather than the Facebook chief executive himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is absolutely astonishing that Mark Zuckerberg is not prepared to submit himself to questioning in front of a parliamentary... hearing,&quot; Damian Collins said last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We already know some of what Schroepfer hopes to offer the committee, thanks to a leak to the BBC : he will say that Facebook will commit to enforcing transparency for political advertising in time for the local elections. Not this year's, though - the ones held in May 2019.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That offering may not have the desired effect, if for no other reason than it's not actually a new deal: Facebook had already committed to rolling out its regulations worldwide earlier this month, alongside another set of tight rules for people who can run large Facebook pages. The only new aspect to Schroepfer's expected offer today is the (fairly unambitious) timescale that's attached.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">block-time published-time 9.47am BST </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Facebook's chief technical officer gives evidence to DCMS committee  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mike Schroepfer, Facebook's CTO, is giving evidence this morning to the digital, culture, media and sport select committee, as part of its inquiry into fake news.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The terms of the inquiry, led by committee chair Damian Collins, have grown wildly since it was constituted in January 2017, and you can expect the questions to be less focused on fake news specifically, and more on Facebook's wider effect on British political culture - including, in particular, the Cambridge Analytica scandal and Facebook's response.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WhatsApp is raising the minimum age requirement to use the service to 16 in the European Union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The messaging service currently requires users to be at least 13 but, with the introduction of the new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), from 25 May it will increase for those inside the EU.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Facebook-owned service will ask users to confirm their age when prompting them to agree to new terms of service on the platform in the coming weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WhatsApp said it was not asking for any new rights to collect personal information. &quot;Our goal is simply to explain how we use and protect the limited information we have about you,&quot; the company said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Internet giants such as Facebook and Twitter have also been rolling out new terms of service ahead of the GDPR launch, in order to bring their businesses in line with the new regulations, which require clear consent from users to access their data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The regulations give users greater powers to control how their data is used and the right to have data erased. WhatsApp said the update ensured it could &quot;meet the new high standards of transparency for how we protect the privacy of our users&quot;. It plans to keep the over-13 age restriction in the rest of the world.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">CAITLIN MORRISON</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">COMMENT; Pg. 45</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">513 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WhatsApp has revealed that it's planning to raise the minimum age for users in Europe from 13 to 16, in order to comply with new EU rules around data protection. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which comes into force in May, will change the way businesses can use data, raising the bar consent-wise. One of the rules is that 16 will become the minimum age at which a person can join an online service without the consent of their parents or guardian.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, it's hard not to see this as another case of a tech company paying lip service to the law given that WhatsApp has not revealed how it will maintain the new age controls, which is clearly the most important aspect of its new rule. Facebook already bars under-13s from signing up (although founder Mark Zuckerberg has in the past bemoaned this restriction), but it's well known that a large portion of Facebook users haven't quite reached their 13th birthday. They simply pretend that they have, because there are no immediate consequences for doing so, apart from maybe a slight twinge of guilt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And it's not difficult to work out why this is happening - there is no major obstacle to simply ignoring the age limit. The social network requires no proof of age, so any kid who can access the internet and doesn't feel any qualms about lying to a website can jump right in to the fun of Facebook. There is nothing to suggest that this won't happen with WhatsApp. The company, which is owned by Facebook, could of course demand proof of age. However, it's unlikely the service will embrace an onerous sign-up process that risks putting off prospective users before they've even downloaded the app.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If we've learnt one thing from the Cambridge Analytica saga it's that the way to make a tech firm take action is to hit it where it hurts - in the financials. Facebook's market value was slashed by tens of billions in wake of the &quot;data breach&quot; revelations, with the stock suffering its biggest drop in four years as it struggled to contain the crisis. This is what prompted the group to bring out the big guns, namely Mark Zuckerberg himself making an unprecedented appearance before US politicians in spite of his traditionally extremely carefully managed public presence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If teenagers find a way to get around WhatsApp's age requirement, which they surely will because the messaging service doesn't seem to be putting up any actual barriers to this happening, will the company be forced to cough up? The flimsy nod to compliance that was announced this week is a sign that WhatsApp isn't taking the new rules seriously.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We may just have to wait for the financial implications of failing to live up to GDPR requirements to become clear to see what real action the company can take. According to the legislation, fines will go up to either Euro 20m (&pound;17.5m), or 4 per cent of annual global turnover - for a company like Facebook, the sums would be astronomical. Hopefully it won't take too many costly crackdowns by the EU to encourage tech firms to set out a clear cut way in which they plan to take GDPR seriously.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Something big kicks off late next month, and I don't mean the hangover from Harry and Meghan's wedding party. On May 25, the so-called General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the European Union's answer to public concern over misuse of private data, comes fully into force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hardly anyone is going to be fully up to speed from day one. The new law requires companies to ensure compliance not just for themselves, but in all their suppliers too. Unilever alone has around 120,000 suppliers to whip into line. International telecoms operators will typically have nearly 20,000 apiece.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So challenging has the compliance effort become - and potentially crippling the costs of failure - that Google's weekly revenue meetings are said to have been converted into weekly GDPR meetings until the deadline is met. Regulatory compliance has come to eclipse all other priorities. It's not just the titans of the internet who are affected. Data is these days core to virtually all www.business.No one entirely escapes the long arm of the GDPR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whole armies of data protection lawyers, consultants and self styled experts have been spawned to milk the beast for all it's worth. Not since the mass hysteria of Y2K has there been such a gravy train. Only this one isn't imaginary; four years in the drafting, GDPR is real and manmade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Its purpose is to define both the rights of individuals when it comes to personal data, and the obligations of organisations that handle it. The new law makes it easier for citizens to access the data companies hold about them, introduces a new and more hard hitting system of fines, and requires organisations to obtain the clear-cut consent from people they collect information about. Particularly onerous is the requirement on companies to keep a detailed record of data usage so as to create an electronic trail for regulators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Daunting stuff, described by one executive tasked with implementing the new rules as &quot;a vast multiplicity of issues to confront, some of them inadequately defined so that you have to err on the side of caution for fear of falling foul of case law at a later date&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Elizabeth Denham, the UK's Information Commissioner, it means &quot;data protection will be a boardroom issue in a way it hasn't in the past&quot;. You can say that again. Huge amounts of the CEO's time these days seems to be consumed by the dismal task of compliance of one form or another, and it is about to get a great deal worse. Whatever happened to the joys of business? Data is the new oil, goes the now well used cliche, and European regulators have been chasing it hard. The Facebook scandal has further strengthened public support for their efforts. More hated than even the bankers, the tech giants have invited their own regulatory nemesis, pulling everyone else into the net at the same time. With no data protection law as such, the US has pursued a somewhat different approach. Broadly summarised, anything goes, provided customers are aware of the use their data is being put to and give their consent. Is there a connection between this more tolerant approach to data usage and America's relative success in spawning new data-based companies? The US's market-driven approach has created its own remedies. In pursuit of best business practice, some US companies voluntarily offer their own privacy notices, thereby winning competitive advantage. But others, such as Facebook, have pushed the envelope to the limits and beyond, and are now scrambling to correct the damage. In any case, in staying ahead of the game, light touch regulation may have played some part.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the trade-off between data protection and exploitation, is Europe getting the balance right? And more particularly, is there an opportunity for post-Brexit Britain in regulatory divergence from the EU's apparently heavyhanded approach? It's a nice thought, but in practical terms somewhat unrealistic. Nothing flows cross border more easily than data, and in order to keep that movement as frictionless as possible, regulatory regimes have to be aligned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the GDPR, personal data cannot be transferred to countries outside the EU unless they guarantee a similar level of data protection. Effectively, then, anyone transacting data with the EU is bound by the same laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The constraints are very similar to those that hinder significant regulatory divergence for the City after Brexit. British access to European markets in financial services post-Brexit depends vitally on at least maintaining regulatory equivalence in financial regulation, and possibly exact regulatory alignment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The same goes for data, where the practical scope for laxer regulation may be quite limited. For instance, few industries depend more on cross border data flows than international finance. Large parts of the City would be out of business unless judged to have achieved &quot;adequacy&quot; of regulatory alignment on data protection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nor does there appear to be any political appetite for significant divergence. Britain has led from the front in shaping Europe's data protection laws, and even now is giving legal force to them through its own Data Protection Bill. The direction of travel internationally is also clear. Even Mark Zuckerberg has conceded that the US may have to follow Europe on data protection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like it or not, data is the future. In its totality, it is already responsible for a major part of our economy, and it is growing like topsy. Eventually, all else will become secondary. Forget manufacturing. There's no future for jobs in a business that will one day be almost wholly automated. Thus far, Western economies have led the world in the application of data and the development of new data-based industries. But others, notably China, are catching up fast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What's more, there's no such thing as data protection in China. To the contrary, personal data, and increasingly the related phenomenon of artificial intelligence, are quite openly used for the purposes of surveillance and political manipulation, with no questions asked. It's right that privacy is protected. The worry is that in so doing, we surrender our lead to less scrupulous imitators.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook's data privacy problems have had little impact on its profitability as the company posted record revenues for the first quarter of 2018.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company made $11.97bn in revenue in the first three months of the year, up 49% from the previous year, beating Wall Street estimates of $11.41bn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Despite facing important challenges, our community and business are off to a strong start in 2018,&quot; said Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's founder and CEO, in a statement. &quot;We are taking a broader view of our responsibility and investing to make sure our services are used for good. But we also need to keep building new tools to help people connect, strengthen our communities, and bring the world closer together.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Facebook releases content moderation guidelines - rules long kept secret</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook's approach to privacy has come under intense scrutiny over the last few weeks, following the revelation that the personal data of millions of Americans was harvested from Facebook and improperly shared with the political consultancy Cambridge Analytica. Stoked by fears that the data may have been used to try to influence elections in the US and Europe and the discovery that Facebook collects a lot more data than the average person realises (including web browsing history and, in some cases, text messages ), some users have started a #DeleteFacebook movement, including the co-founder of the Facebook-owned WhatsApp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook's user figures indicate that the movement had little effect, with daily active users rising to 1.45 billion (48 million more than the previous quarter) and monthly active users to 2.2bn. Both figures mark a 13% increase from the same quarter in 2017.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, much of the momentum behind the movement came in April, when Zuckerberg delivered eight hours of testimony before Congress, after the quarter was over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the last few weeks, the social network has announced a slew of changes to its privacy tools and to the way that it collects and shares user data. It has also introduced a verification process for political advertisers and page administrators and plans to comply with Europe's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). As if to demonstrate its continued commitment to transparency, this week the company published its content moderation guidelines - a year after the Guardian revealed the secret rules.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook's chief financial officer, Dave Wehner, warned that GDPR could lead to a fall in users and revenue in Europe, particularly as people start tightening up their accounts to prevent so much targeted advertising.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While we don't expect the changes will have a significant impact on ad revenue, any change in our ability for us and advertisers to use data can impact our optimisation potential at the margin,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite pledging to roll out GDPR-compliant settings to all Facebook users, the chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, said the settings &quot; would not be exactly the same format&quot;. Because of this, Facebook doesn't expect there to be any impact on ad revenue outside Europe, indicating that those settings would not make a difference to the way Facebook uses people's personal data, which is the whole point of GDPR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Is Facebook replaceable? Tech investor launches bid to 'start the process'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sandberg rejected any suggestion that Facebook should diversify its business model away from micro-targeted advertising.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are proud of the ad model we've built,&quot; she said. &quot;It ensures people see more useful ads, allows businesses to grow, and keeps the service free. Advertising-supported businesses like Facebook equalise access and improve opportunity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zuckerberg said that changes the company had made to the news feed to prioritise &quot;meaningful interaction&quot; rather than &quot;passive consumption&quot; were already having an effect - with a decline in people passively watching video.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People want [Facebook] to be more about friends and family and less about content consumption,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WhatsApp is raising the minimum user age from 13 to 16, potentially locking out large numbers of teenagers as the messaging app looks to comply with the EU's new data protection rules.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Facebook-owned messaging service that has more than 1.5 billion users will ask people in the 28 EU states to confirm they are 16 or older as part of a prompt to accept a new terms of service and an updated privacy policy in the next few weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How WhatsApp will confirm age and enforce the new limit is unclear. The service does not currently verify identity beyond requirements for a working mobile phone number.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WhatsApp said it is not asking for any new rights to collect personal information in the agreement it has created for the European Union. It said : &quot;Our goal is simply to explain how we use and protect the limited information we have about you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WhatsApp's minimum age will remain 13 years outside of Europe, in line with its parent company. In order to comply with the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which comes into force on 25 May, Facebook has taken a different approach for its primary social network. As part of its separate data policy, the company requires those aged between 13 and 15 years old to nominate a parent or guardian to give permission for them to share information with the social network, or otherwise limit the personalisation of the site.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WhatsApp also announced on Tuesday that it would begin allowing users to download a report detailing the data it holds on them, such as the make and model of the device they used, their contacts and groups and any blocked numbers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GDPR is the biggest overhaul of online privacy since the birth of the internet, giving Europeans the right to know what data is stored on them and the right to have it deleted. The new laws also give regulators the power to fine corporations up to 4% of their global turnover or (EURO)20m, whichever is larger, for failing to meet the tough new data protection requirements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WhatsApp, founded in 2009 and bought by Facebook for $19bn in 2014, has come under pressure from some European governments in recent years because of its use of end-to-end encryption and its plan to share user data with its parent company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2017 European regulators disrupted a move by WhatsApp to change its policies to allow it to share users' phone numbers and other information with Facebook for ad targeting and other uses. WhatsApp suspended the change in Europe after widespread regulatory scrutiny, and signed an undertaking in March with the UK Information Commissioner's Office to not share any EU citizen's data with Facebook until GDPR comes into force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But on Tuesday the messaging firm said it wanted to continue sharing data with Facebook at some point. It said: &quot;As we have said in the past, we want to work closer with other Facebook companies in the future and we will keep you updated as we develop our plans.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Breaking away from TSB briefly, UK housebuilder Persimmon is being given a bloody nose by shareholders. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Investors at its AGM are angry at &quot;totally and utterly unjustifiable&quot; multi-million bonuses paid to its chief executive and senior managers, including a &pound;75m award for CEO Jeff Fairburn. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Around 64% of shareholders refused to back the package - either by abstaining or voting against it. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Euan Stirling, head of stewardship at Aberdeen Standard Investments, one of Persimmon's biggest shareholders with a 2.3% stake, said the &quot;enormous sums&quot; due to Fairburn and other senior managers were &quot;grossly excessive&quot; and have &quot;tarnished&quot; the housebuilder's name. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stirling said that Fairburn's offer to reduce his bonus from his legally entitled &pound;110m to &pound;75m &quot;does not even get close to acceptable&quot;. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stirling declared:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The important point I referred to is that regardless of any moral or societal duties, company directors have a legal responsibility to act in the best long-term interests of the company that employs them</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today's remuneration results suggest that the executive directors at Persimmon have lost sight of that because the long-term success of the company is being endangered by the reputational damage associated with grossly excessive pay!&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I arrived on Saturday for a five night break and this has totally ruined my holiday. My card was declined in a restaurant I went to and I had to walk 50 mins back to my hotel as I didn't have enough money to pay for a taxi. I tried to contact TSB via email and on the phone but after waiting for 40 mins I couldn't wait any longer.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The whole thing is a fiasco. I knew that the site would be down as TSB said they were 'upgrading' the business banking and instead of the trusty card reader that I've been using for years they would be introducing a system which uses an app instead. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Although I'm a web designer and tech savvy I didn't want to install the app for various reasons (size, privacy, just don't want it on my phone!) but did so reluctantly. The amount of permissions the app wanted was outrageous so I emailed them to say that I wasn't happy and that from 25 May when GDPR comes into force I'd be contacting them every day to delete the unnecessary data that they were collecting via the app. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A very rapid response suggested that I order one of their basic devices instead, which I did. Credit where credit is due, it arrived promptly yesterday, just in time for the new system to be live. Except of course it's not live. The system is still down. Also the basic device seems incapable of doing anything at all. This is one of those 'upgrades' that seems completely futile and designed to annoy customers.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Penny was eventually forced to drive eight miles to her nearest branch, Gillingham in Dorset. Staff looked like they'd &quot;been in an earthquake&quot;, she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To take money out they have to use handwritten slips like the old credit cards. I wanted to know my balance which, after two or three attempts they were able to access.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My direct debits have been going out - what a pity Paul Pester couldn't have reassured customers that despite the problems, standing orders etc were being processed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WhatsApp</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has revealed that it's planning to raise the minimum age for users in Europe from 13 to 16, in order to comply with new EU rules around data protection. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TheGeneral Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which comes into force in May, will change the way businesses can use data, raising the bar consent-wise.One of the rules is that 16 will become the minimum age at which a person can join an online service without the consent of their parents or guardian. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, it's hard not to see this as another case of a tech company paying lip service to the law given that WhatsApp has not revealed how it will maintain the new age controls, which is clearly the most important aspect of its new rule. Facebook already bars under-13s from signing up (although founderMark Zuckerberghas in the past bemoaned this restriction), but it's well known that a large portion of Facebook users haven't quite reached their 13th birthday. They simply pretend that they have, because there are no immediate consequences for doing so, apart from maybe a slight twinge of guilt.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And it's not difficult to work out why this is happening - there is no major obstacle to simply ignoring the age limit. The social network requires no proof of age, so any kid who can access the internet and doesn't feel any qualms about lying to a website can jump right in to the fun of Facebook.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People may be leaving Facebook, but social media is here to stay</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is nothing to suggest that this won't happen with WhatsApp. The company, which is </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">owned by Facebook</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">, could of course demand proof of age. However, it's unlikely the service will embrace an onerous sign-up process that risks putting off prospective users before they've even downloaded the app. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If we've learned one thing from the ongoing </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cambridge Analytica</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> saga it's that the way to make a tech firm take action is to hit it where it hurts - in the financials. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook's market value was slashed by tens of billions in wake of the &quot;data breach&quot; revelations, with the stock suffering its biggest drop in four years as it struggled to contain the crisis. This is what prompted the group to bring out the big guns, namely Mark Zuckerberg himself making an unprecedented appearance before US politicians in spite of his traditionally extremely carefully managed public presence. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WhatsApp</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> goes down for global users</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If teenagers find a way to get around WhatsApp's age requirement, which they surely will because the messaging service doesn't seem to be putting up any actual barriers to this happening, will the company be forced to cough up? The flimsy nod to compliance that was announced this week is a sign that WhatsApp isn't taking the new rules seriously. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We may just have to wait for the financial implications of failing to live up to GDPR requirements to become clear to see what real action the company can take. According to the legislation, fines will go up to either (EURO)20m (&pound;17.5m), or 4 per cent of annual global turnover - for a company like Facebook, the sums would be astronomical. Hopefully it won't take too many costly crackdowns by the EU to encourage tech firms to set out a clear cut way in which they plan to take GDPR seriously.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This proliferation of politely worded emailsasking you to please accept or not miss out or continue to receive is the public face of a a gargantuan piece of European data protection legislation called GDPR(General Data Protection Regulation), which comes into force exactly a month from now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new laws, which the UK has promised to keep in place after Brexit, make it easier for people to find out what information companies hold about them, have tougher penalties for companies who don't keep data secure and require much clearer consent from individuals giving up their information - hence all those emails.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the Facebook scandal scared you, you should hear about smart cities</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a wonderful coincidence of course that a regulation that's been grinding through the system for years should be coming into force just as the question of information rights becomes the political subject of the day, following the revelation that people's information on Facebook was shared without their knowledge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There must be some happy civil servants in Brussels right now congratulating themselves on their foresight that the rise of the digital economy would turn data into a precious commodity which people should be able to control. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At Doteveryone, we conducted research which shows this data protection overhaul should be welcome. People care deeply about their personal information, 94 per cent say it's important to know how their data is used and 91 per cent say it's important to be able to choose how much data they share.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But our Digital Understanding report, released this week, shows people don't know what happens to their data-83 per cent don't realise that information about them is gathered from what other people share, 45 per cent aren't aware that what they put on social media is used to target adverts, 79 per cent don't know their information can be used to determine prices and almost two thirds don't realise tech companies make money from their data. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report shows where there are currently low levels of public understanding around digital technologies. But this can't be blamed on the public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Digital understanding is dependent on digital technologies being understandable. At present they are not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We know from speaking to users that many people don't read the long list of terms and conditions presented to them. In fact, 43 per cent say there's no point reading them as companies will do what they want anyway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GDPR should address exactly that problem-consent must be freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous. Companies who breach the legislation can face fines of 4 per cent of their turnover or &pound;17.5 million, whichever is greater.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook has reportedly deployed legions to address how to meet the new obligations and haspromised to go beyond mere compliance with the letter of the law. But the decision to move 1.5 billion of its users based outside Europe away from the auspices of its (GDPR covered) Irish headquarters to the more easy-going regime still available in the US suggests it may not be such a fan of the increased data protection requirements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And in the way it's introducing the new law to its European users, Facebook is playing tech's usual trick of making things easy to use but not as easy to understand. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In its email, Facebook tells me it's updated its terms to better explain its service and promises it's made it easier for me to control my data privacy and security settings. I'm then asked to review and accept.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But clicking through, it's clear most of us will accept but not review. At each stage there's a nice big button to say &quot;I agree&quot; - conveniently located just where your cursor still hovers from the previous screen. Want to do something else? You're sent on a meandering tour along a set of pages to dig through new settings.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook's brilliance at frictionless design - the seamless experience we've all come to expect from our simple-on-the-outside interfaces - risks making this milestone piece of data protection meaningless.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And it's not just Facebook - the email that told me I was &quot;in control&quot; was from online retail giant Asos, and had a nice big button to &quot;opt me in&quot; and a teeny hidden link if I wanted to tinker with anything.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's a design mantra in the government's digital service that good digital products&quot;do the hard work to make it simple&quot;. But tech has now become polluted with the deceptively simple.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Information rights will be meaningless unless the public is in a position to exercise them. We need new codes of practice for design and consent which mean that good digital products do the hard work to make themselves understandable. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the Information Commissioner considers who falls foul of the new rules next month, she should mark companies on whether they pass this test.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook recently found itself in the crosshairs of privacy advocates over theCambridge Analyticascandal that saw the personal information of 87 million accounts harvested for political gain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mark Zuckerberg appeared in front of US lawmakers to explain the company's approach to data processing and give assurances that it would safeguard people's privacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But far more important than Zuck being taken to task by the US Congress is the General Data Protection Regulation coming in to force in Europe on May 25th.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The regulation is the most sweeping piece of legislation when it comes to data privacy of the last 20 years. It affects any company or organisation that processes the data of any EU citizen - and it applies whether or not that company is based in the EU itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Facebook announces privacy changes for GDPR - and brings facial recognition to the UK                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Importantly, it also gives individuals more rights to their information in an effort to give consumers a bit of power in the face of gigantic companies and so-called &quot;big data&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What's more, the fact that Britain is leaving the EU doesn't matter - the UK government is implementing the Data Protection Bill which largely mirrors the GDPR with only a couple of small changes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     WhatsApp will BAN under-16s from using its app across Europe                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are 99 articles within the legislation, setting out the rights of individuals and the obligations of organisations that are classed as either &quot;controllers&quot; or &quot;processors&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Controllers direct the collection of information while processors actually carry out actions on the data. The two are not mutually exclusive - a company can be a controller and a processor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Article 3 of the GDPR states that the regulation applies to the processing of personal data &quot;in the context of the activities of an establishment of a controller or a processor in the Union, regardless of whether the processing takes place in the Union or not.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even if the company processing the data isn't based in the EU - if they are offering goods or services to EU citizens, they are still bound by the regulation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The regulation also lays out special categories of data - such as political or sexual orientation - that require explicit written consent. There are also more stringent rules in place for children under the age of 16.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Web searches to delete Facebook DOUBLED in the UK following Cambridge Analytica data breach                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For consumers, it brings new powers that require firms to get clear consent from users before processing their data, as well as grants users a right to easily access the data collected from them and transparency on how it is being used.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Therefore, you are able to request copies of your data from any company, free of charge and should (unless it requires disproportionate effort) have it supplied to you within a month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also requires companies to tidy up their privacy policies to make them clearer and more transparent for users - which is why you're likely seeing a spate of emails come through from services you use asking you to take a look at their revised privacy policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     First WhatsApp update since Facebook privacy scandal will make a MASSIVE change to your messaging                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Part of the reason companies are taking such a notice of GDPR is that the fines involved for noncompliance are gigantic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the most serious breaches, regulators will be able to issue penalties equivalent of up to 4% of annual global turnover or 20 million euros - whichever is greater.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Less serious breaches can still attract a 10 million fine or 2% of global turnover with all the proceeds of the fine being handed over to the Treasury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For giant companies, these fines could run into hundreds of millions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it's also a chance for companies to engage with their customers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;GDPR is a good opportunity to win consumer trust, examine closely how data is collected and stored, and prepare for a world where this data will become increasingly valuable,&quot; said Juerg Birri, the global head of legal service at KPMG.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Many of our clients see GDPR as an opportunity to build a picture of how their organisation manages data, which has recently become a key element for company reputation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Future File podcast: All about the apps                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It already appears to be. Many large technology and internet companies have begun the process of making their data practices more transparent with the threat of large fines hanging over them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BothFacebookand Twitter have been rolling out updates to their privacy policies, adding clearer language and description of data use, and offering more tools to users to share or remove their personal data from that platform, as it required by GDPR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The recent Cambridge Analytica scandal has also increased public scrutiny on data use, with Facebook acknowledging it has received more questions from users recently on how it gathers and shares personal data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Mark Zuckerberg says you can download EVERYTHING Facebook has on you - here's how                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Increasingly your personal data is the currency that fuels the online world and the more control you have over it, the better.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As part of the new laws, firms must give users greater access to controls around what data they share and what they want to keep private.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook for example is rolling out a tool that enables users to opt-in to facial recognition being used to scan their photos, but also the chance to switch it off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What's more, you are now able to reject or opt out of things like direct marketing at any point - so it's the perfect time to finally stop receiving all those spam messages you're sick of.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook has reported a 63pc increase in quarterly profits, with&nbsp;the under-pressure social network giving no evidence that the Cambridge Analytica row has halted its breakneck growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mark Zuckerberg's social network revealed that revenues in the first quarter of 2018 had risen to $12bn (&pound;8.6bn), a 49pc increase on the same period a year earlier.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The number of people using Facebook each month hit 2.2bn, surpassing analysts' expectations and suggesting the #deletefacebook campaign that followed the company's privacy row had done little to dent user numbers. Profits reached $5bn, up from $3.1bn a year ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The social media giant has been battling one of the biggest crises in its 14-year history since it emerged last month that millions of users had had their data compromised and obtained by Cambridge Analytica before 2015.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">87m users' private details such as likes, religious beliefs and relationship statuses are believed to have been collected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response Facebook has promised tighter controls and a thorough audit of the website, but shares have still fallen almost 15pc since the scandal first broke as it has faced growing calls for regulation and resentment from parts of its user base.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, they climbed more than 7pc in after-hours trading as investors breathed a sigh of relief at the company's apparent financial resilience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the results for the three months to the end of March cover only the first two weeks of the controversy, and so may not show its full effects, the company's chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg suggested there had been almost no impact on its advertising business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the immediate days [after the scandal broke] we heard from a handful of advertisers who paused spend, one of whom already came back,&quot; she said. &quot;We haven't seen a meaningful trend since then.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Sandberg mounted a staunch defence of the company's advertising-funded business, saying the company was &quot;proud&quot; of it, but admitted that Facebook had considered alternative revenue models such as subscriptions in the past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Technology intelligence - newsletter promo - EOA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recently, Facebook has promised to increase spending on securing users' data and stopped using information obtained from data brokers to target adverts, a move that analysts say could cost it billions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Despite facing important challenges, our community and business are off to a strong start in 2018,&quot; Mr Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief executive, said.&quot;We are taking a broader view of our responsibility and investing to make sure our services are used for good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were two blackspots on the company's results. Facebook's chief financial officer David Wehner admitted that new EU data protection laws known as the GDPR could lead to a fall in user numbers across Europe, and the company increased its forecasts for how much it would be spending on staff to address its recent criticism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook declined to say if recent changes to its central news feed, which relegated the influence of pages from businesses and publishers, had led to users spending less time on the social network.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The state could face fines of (EURO)1 million for breaching a forthcoming EU data protection law after it admitted to storing millions of images, a data compliance lawyer has warned.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Simon McGarr expressed concern that the Department of Social Protection was seeking the services of a company to move four million facial images from a &quot;legacy system database&quot;. He said this contradicted comments made by Regina Doherty, the social protection minister, that the state did not collect this data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Department of Social Protection has used facial recognition software to spot welfare fraudsters. Software has also used been for the public service card, which features a photograph.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokeswoman for the department said that the photographs were stored in a facial image-matching database in the department's secure data centres. This was consistent with data protection laws, she said, as no &quot;facial mapping&quot; tools were used.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr McGarr said that biometric data is defined as facial images by the EU legislation. Storing this data will become illegal under the general data protection regulation (GDPR), an EU law on hosting and processing data, which will come into force on May 25. The Data Protection Bill 2018 is the legal expression of the law in Ireland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The department would be open to fines of up to (EURO)1 million if it were found to be illegally storing images.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't have any confidence that they will be compliant with GDPR,&quot; Mr McGarr added.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GOOGLE'S parent company Alphabet saw profits soar 73pc in its first quarter, thanks to an increase in advertising income, with no sign that privacy concerns were starting to feed through to its bottom line.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alphabet said it generated $31bn (&pound;22.2bn) in revenue in the three months to March 31, pushing net income up 73pc to $9.4bn. Around 85pc of its revenue came from advertising in, equal to $26.6bn, while its 'Other Bets' unit, which includes its Waymo selfdriving business, posted revenue of $150m, up from $132m a year earlier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, although earnings beat analyst expectations, Alphabet's operating profit margin dipped to 22pc from 27pc a year earlier, causing shares to seesaw in extended trade last night, jumping 4pc before falling back down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The results come amid mounting concerns in the wider tech industry over user privacy, in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica data revelations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Technology companies are also facing the introduction of the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation next month, which will give users greater control over their data, and could affect how companies such as Google target adverts and use boughtin data from advertisers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Google chief executive Sundar Pichai said the group started working on GDPR compliance &quot;over 18 months ago&quot; and that it has been working &quot;very closely with advertisers and our partners&quot; on meeting requirements. Meanwhile, last week Google-owned YouTube faced renewed criticism from advertisers, after it emerged that it was running adverts from major brands alongside content prompting paedophilia and Nazism. YouTube said at the time that it had &quot;partnered with our advertisers to make significant changes to how we approach monetisation on You-Tube with stricter policies, better controls and greater transparency. &quot;When we find that ads mistakenly ran against content that doesn't comply with our policies, we immediately remove those ads.&quot; Last year, it was forced to refund advertisers after paid-forclips appeared alongside extremist content.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">YouTube earlier in the day had claimed that extremist videos on You-Tube are taken down quicker when machines intervene. It follows a pledge to get more humans reviewing harmful clips, with YouTube boss Susan Wojcicki promising that by the end of 2018, 10,000 people will be tasked with reducing the time it takes to remove offensive material.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Have you ever wondered what your boss or co-workers say about you behind your back? If you're located in Europe, it will soon be extremely easy to find out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the General Data Protection Regulation that comes into play on 25 May, any individual located in Europe can ask any company for the data it collects about them - and that includes their employer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If an employee files a &quot; subject access request &quot; - an email, fax or letter asking for their personal data - their employer will have 30 days to collate a cache of all the information stored about that person. This includes any email that refers to the worker, as well as performance reviews, job interviews, payroll records, absence records, disciplinary records, computer access logs, CCTV footage, and recordings of phone calls to, from or about the person.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This right has been available to individuals under existing European data protection rules, such as the UK's Data Protection Act, but GDPR makes it much easier to access by removing the cost (UK companies could charge &pound;10 for such a request before), reducing the turnaround time from 40 days to 30 days and introducing extremely harsh penalties for companies not complying. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It can cost the company tens of thousands of pounds because it's incredibly resource intensive,&quot; said Jack Carvel, general counsel at Qubit, which provides personalisation software to e-commerce sites.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In responding to a subject access request, the company must not include another employee's personal information. This means that each item must be painstakingly redacted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Imagine going through every email sent to you or about you,&quot; said Carvel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If a company deletes any of the data to prevent disclosure after the subject access request is made, it can be liable for criminal sanctions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At the moment it's a breach of data protection law [in the UK], but not an actual offence,&quot; said Rowenna Fielding, senior data protection lead at Protecture Limited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Subject access requests are typically made by employees in some kind of employment dispute with their employer - it's a free and quick way of getting &quot;predisclosure&quot; ahead of litigation. However, there's no reason why an employee, former employee or even someone who only had a job interview with the company can't make such a request just out of interest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because of how onerous such requests can be, some data privacy experts warn that they could be exploited by activists to punish a company. A group of unhappy former employees could all file requests at the same time, forcing the company to dedicate resources to respond within the 30-day timeframe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you look at it from that angle it seems unfair for companies. But think about the pensioner who was refused a mortgage and doesn't understand why,&quot; said Carvel, referring to a case for which the regulation was designed. &quot;It's not intended to be for malicious activists or disgruntled employees.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Subject access requests generally allow an individual to see a copy of the information an organisation holds about them, whether it's a mortgage lender, social media company or retailer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are some exceptions to the data that companies must hand over, including information relating to trade secrets, anything relating to current management issues such as restructuring or redundancies, any confidential communications with lawyers, health records, or personal data that is processed for purposes relating to criminal justice and taxation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instagram is taking some new steps to give users more control over their data on the app.&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Facebook-owned social media platform on Tuesday introduced a new Data Download &nbsp;feature that lets Instagram users download a copy of all the content they've uploaded on the platform.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That includes data such as photos, videos, Stories, profile info, comments and messages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scroll down for video&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An Instagram spokesperson told TechCrunch that the tool is 'currently accessible to everyone on the web, but access via iOS and Android is still rolling out'.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To access the Data Download feature, open the Instagram website on your desktop browser.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From there, navigate to your profile, then click on the gear icon and select 'Privacy and Security'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scroll down the Privacy and Security page until you get to the 'Data Download' section and click on 'Request Download'.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instagram them prompts you to enter an email address in order to access all your data.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The firm noted that it may take up to 48 hours for it to send a download link.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until now, Instagram has lacked a data portability tool and users don't have the option of saving their photos after they've already been posted to the app.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's despite Facebook introducing a similar feature, called the Download Your Information tool, in 2010.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instagram is likely launching the tool in order to comply with upcoming European privacy laws that require data portability.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) laws, which are set to roll out on May 25, also require companies to delete user data upon request.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Importantly, the tool lets users control the data they've uploaded to the platform, but not necessarily all the data Instagram has collected on them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thus far, users have been forced to use potentially unsecure or scammy third-party apps to download their data from Instagram, via apps like Instaport.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook's 'Download Your Information' tool allows users to download everything off their profile, including things like friends lists, events, messages, wall posts and photos, among other things.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's been a helpful tool for users who want to learn more about what information Facebook has collected on them.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also makes it easier for users to move off the platform should they decide to delete their account in favor of using a different social media service.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it's also been somewhat of a wake up call for users who were shocked to learn that the firm was scraping data like call logs and text messages.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the wake of Facebook's privacy scandal, many users and experts have criticized platforms like Instagram, Twitter and Google for being similarly tight-lipped about the amount of data they collect on their users.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some users have said that they would move to using only Instagram after being outraged by Facebook's data collection practices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, many were quick to point out that other top social media platforms, like Instagram and WhatsApp, are both owned by Facebook and, therefor, likely to be just as suspicious when it comes to user data privacy.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A recent study by internet search engine Duck Duck Go found that a majority of Americans don't know that Facebook actually owns Instagram.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A survey of 1,153 US adults showed that 56.9% of them didn't know the social media giant owns Instagram.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg was questioned about this when he testified on Capitol Hill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zuckerberg answered questions from lawmakers about the firm's massive privacy scandal, which resulted in 87 million users' data being harvested without their knowledge from the platform by Cambridge Analytica, a political consultancy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senators asked Zuckerberg to name some of Facebook's legitimate competitors, to which he said Google, Apple, Amazon and Microsoft.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added that internet users tend to use an upwards of eight different apps on a regular basis.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Critics pointed out, however, that Facebook owns many of those apps, including Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and the core Facebook app.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New EU data privacy regulations could make Facebook  and Google  even more powerful, according to some internet experts.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The laws require tech companies to ask for users' consent for their data, but are likely to strengthen Google and Facebook's dominance over smaller internet firms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's because cautious consumers are less likely to trust unfamiliar newcomers with their private information than recognised brands, researchers have claimed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The changes could also put off start-ups that lack the resources to comply with the regulations from competing with larger companies, they said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Together these factors may end up ballooning the monpolies that are already enjoyed by Silicon Valley giants like Facebook and Google.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scroll down for video</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Regulations help incumbents,' Professor Avi Goldfarb, a marketing expert at the University of Toronto in Canada who has studied the effect of privacy regulations on competition, told the New York Times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Research conducted by Mr Goldfarb in 2013 concluded that privacy regulation could be anti-competitive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is because getting permissions from users for their data was typically much more expensive for younger companies than for well-established firms.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) will enter force on May 25 and&nbsp;aims to&nbsp;strengthen and unify data protection for EU citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This means cracking down on how companies like Google and Facebook use and sell the data they collect on their users.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook and Google have recently come under scrunity for the way they handle their users' data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In March it was revealed that Facebook had allowed the political research firm Cambridge Analytica to syphen the data of nearly 87 million of its users, many without their permission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Google has grappled with question over its video-sharing website YouTube as lawmakers raise concerns that the search giant's data-collection system is as vigorous as Facebook's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The EU's GDPR rules will restrict how internet firms collect, store and use EU citizens' personal data, and will require these companies to explain how they use this information in plain, simple language.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tech giants can no longer employ convoluted user agreements that are often ignored as a way to gain access to people's personal information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But according to Nicolas Colin, co-founder and director at the Family, a French start-up accelerator, this could strengthen Google and Facebook's monopolies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'People tend to give that permission to companies they trust,' he told the New York Times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Stricter rules strengthen companies because they have that key asset that is trust.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One internet privacy expert suggests Facebook may be using the Cambridge Analytica data scandal&nbsp;for its own profit.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Bernie Hogan, a researcher at the University of Oxford, said Facebook is using the fallout as an excuse to cut its ties with third-party app developers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This allows the company to 'reign in' more services under the Facebook umbrella, opening the door to new lucrative industries that could see the company rival big platforms like Tinder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Hogan, a Senior Research Fellow at the Oxford Internet Institute, told MailOnline: 'Facebook are champions of invasive data collection. Collecting more data than they should has been a part of their corporate mission for years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'This is not changing, nor have they said it is. They have said they are restricting the sharing of this data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'If anything they are profitably using this scandal as an excuse to clamp down on sharing with third parties and reign in more under Facebook's umbrella.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Tinder using Facebook likes will be gone, but who knows, Facebook dating might appear instead.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Something big kicks off late next month, and I don't mean the hangover from Harry and Megan's wedding party. On&nbsp;May 25, the so-called General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the European Union's answer to public concern over misuse of private data, comes fully into force. The very term brings forth a yawn, so do bear with.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hardly anyone is going to be fully up to speed from day one. The new law requires companies to ensure compliance not just for themselves, but in all their suppliers too -&nbsp;&quot;contractual uplift&quot;, to use the legalese. Unilever alone has around 120,000 suppliers to whip into line. International telecoms operators will typically have nearly 20,000 apiece.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So challenging has the compliance effort become - and potentially crippling the costs of failure -&nbsp;that Google's weekly revenue meetings are said to have been converted into weekly GDPR meetings until the deadline is met. Regulatory compliance has come to eclipse all other priorities.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's not just the titans of the internet -&nbsp;Google, Facebook, Amazon and so on - who are affected. Data is these days core to virtually all business. No-one entirely escapes the long arm of the GDPR. Whole armies of data protection lawyers, consultants and self styled experts have been spawned to milk the beast for all it's worth. Not since the mass hysteria of Y2K has there been such a gravy train. Only this one isn't imaginary; four years in the drafting, GDPR is real and manmade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Its purpose is to define both the rights of individuals when it comes to personal data, and the obligations of organisations that handle it. The new law makes it easier for citizens to access the data companies hold about them, introduces a new and more hard hitting system of fines, and&nbsp;requires organisations to obtain the clear cut consent from people they collect information about. Particularly onerous is the requirement on companies to keep a detailed record of data usage so as to create an electronic trail for regulators when they come calling.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a glance | Your data rights</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Daunting stuff, described by one executive tasked with implementing the new rules as &quot;a vast multiplicity of issues to confront, some of them inadequately defined so that you have to err on the side of caution for fear of falling foul of case law at a later date&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Elizabeth Denham, the UK's Information Commissioner, it means &quot;data protection will be a boardroom issue in a way it hasn't in the past&quot;. You can say that again. Huge amounts of the CEO's time these days seems to be consumed by the dismal task of compliance of one form or another, and it is about to get a great deal worse. Whatever happened to the joys of business?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Data is the new oil, goes the now well used cliche, and European regulators have been chasing it hard. The Facebook scandal has further strengthened public support for their efforts. More hated than even the bankers, the tech giants have invited their own regulatory nemesis, pulling everyone else into the net at the same time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What you need to know about the privacy row engulfing Facebook and Cambridge Analytica</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With no data protection law as such, the US has pursued a somewhat different approach. Broadly summarised, anything goes, provided customers are aware of the use their data is being put to and give their consent. Is there a connection between this more tolerant approach to data usage and America's relative success in spawning new data based companies?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US's market driven approach has created its own remedies. In pursuit of best business practice, some US companies voluntarily offer their own privacy notices, thereby winning competitive advantage. But others, such as Facebook, have pushed the envelope to the limits and beyond, and are now scrambling to correct the damage. In any case, in staying ahead of the game, light touch regulation may have played some part.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the trade off between data protection and exploitation, is Europe getting the balance right? And more particularly, is there an opportunity for post Brexit Britain in regulatory divergence from the EU's apparently heavy handed approach?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a nice thought, but in practical terms somewhat unrealistic. Nothing flows cross border more easily than data, and in order to keep that movement as frictionless as possible, regulatory regimes have to be aligned. Under the GDPR, personal data cannot be transferred to countries outside the EU unless they guarantee a similar level of data protection. Effectively, then, anyone transacting data with the EU is bound by the same laws.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The constraints are very similar to those that hinder significant regulatory divergence for the City after Brexit. British access to European markets in financial services post Brexit depends vitally on at least maintaining regulatory equivalence in financial regulation, and possibly exact regulatory alignment.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

It is already responsible for a major part of our economy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The same goes for data, where the practical scope for laxer regulation may be quite limited. For instance, few industries depend more on cross border data flows than international finance. Large parts of the City would be out of business unless judged to have achieved &quot;adequacy&quot; of regulatory alignment on data protection.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nor does there appear to be any political appetite for significant divergence. Britain has led from the front in shaping Europe's data protection laws, and even now is giving legal force to them through its own Data Protection Bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The direction of travel internationally is also clear. Even Mark Zuckerberg has conceded that the US may have to follow Europe on data protection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like it or not, data is the future. In its totality, it is already responsible for a major part of our economy, and it is growing like topsy. Eventually, all else will become secondary. Forget manufacturing. There's no future for jobs in a business that will one day be almost wholly automated. The value added will mainly be in data, and the rest will piggyback off it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amount of data created worldwide each year is accelerating</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thus far, Western economies have led the world in the application of data to existing businesses and the development of new data based industries. But others, notably China, are catching up fast.&nbsp; What's more, there's no such thing as data protection in China. To the contrary, personal data, and increasingly the related phenomenon of artificial intelligence, are quite openly used for the purposes of surveillance and political manipulation, with no questions asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's right that privacy is protected. The worry is that in so doing, we surrender our lead to less scrupulous imitators.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mark Zuckerberg's 10 hours of questioning by US politicians, carried out over two marathon sessions in Washington this month, was striking for how little we learnt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of the senators and congressmen questioning Facebook's founder seemed to lack the most rudimentary understanding of how social media functions, and those who did dedicated much of their allotted time to grandstanding, rather than forensic scrutiny.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But we did at least learn one thing: Zuckerberg is not, on the face of it, opposed to the social media regulation that so many desire. He admitted that &quot;I think there are going to be... places where there needs to be more regulation&quot;, and said he was &quot;not the type of person that thinks all regulation is bad&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was a deft move because it appeared to defuse a charge levelled against Zuckerberg and many of his fellow Silicon Valley leaders: that they are fundamentally hostile to regulation, see new laws as hindering progress, and generally believe governments should get out of their way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like all caricatures, there is some truth in it.Regulation is often viewed with suspicion by the tech community. But not always.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook and Twitter, for example, have been open in their support for proposed US legislation that would force social media companies to disclose who has paid for political adverts. Zuckerberg, in his Washington hearings this month, had warm words for new European data laws known as the GDPR that will be applied from next month. &quot;I think they [the Europeans] get things right,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was striking because the GDPR is a potentially ominous new landscape for Silicon Valley's giants. It gives internet users much stricter controls over how their data is shared, stored and processed, and forces companies to be clearer about how they collect it. Failures can result in fines of up to 4pc of annual turnover, a sum that would add up to over $1.6bn (&pound;1.1bn) in Facebook's case. The company has admitted that the regulations could affect user numbers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So what explains the sudden support for it? Some Damascene conversion? Is Zuckerberg ready to cede power to legislation, and admit the limits of Facebook's ability to police its own domain? This seems unlikely. Such control is rarely given up willingly, especially in Europe, where politicians have proven more eager than their US counterparts to fine technology companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, we must consider the alternative. The reason Zuckerberg welcomes regulation is because it benefits him to do so. New rules on internet companies, rather than cutting Facebook down to size, could well do the opposite, entrenching their power and making it more difficult for competitors to spring up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Take Facebook's controversy, which centres on how the political consultants Cambridge Analytica exploited the social network to obtain private data of 87m users. Most of that data was exposed not through fault of the people affected, but because they were friends with someone who downloaded a particular app. The scandal is that Facebook data ended up in the wrong people's hands, not that it had it in the first place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company's response has been to lock down the social network; making changes that prevent other parties from accessing user data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Any regulations that stem from the controversy will be about stopping companies like Facebook from sharing the information they have on citizens. It is a laudable aim, but at the same time, it bolsters those who already have the most valuable warchests of personal data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook, in particular, seems to regard the new laws as an opportunity, rather than a threat. Last week it began asking users in Europe to give Facebook permission to apply facial recognition to their profiles. It has not used facial recognition in Europe for the past six years, but a GDPRinspired privacy overhaul has given it the chance to turn it back on, provided that users agree.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the company is shifting the responsibility for handling the data of 1.5bn users outside of Europe, currently governed at its international base in Dublin, to the US in order to exempt them from the new European rules. Only a company of Facebook's size and resources would be able to do this at the drop of a hat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the unintended consequence of new internet regulations: those with the biggest pockets are in the best position to comply, and those who have built up a dominant position are able to pull up the ladder behind them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the challenger that one day might dethrone Facebook is hobbled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Europe's new data laws attempt to address this, demanding that users can &quot;port&quot; their information from one service to another, but the social networks have not agreed how this might work in practice, making a mockery of the idea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is another reason Facebook may not oppose regulation: the alternative is worse. It owns three of the biggest social apps - Facebook itself, Instagram and WhatsApp - which will all have more than 1bn users by the end of the year. It would rather be contending with new laws than discussing monopolies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook did not replace MySpace because the latter was regulated, but because it created something better. Today's attempts to rein in Zuckerberg's company may present a challenge to Facebook, but they will also make it more difficult for any upstart to topple it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Facebook seems to see the new laws as an opportunity, rather than a threat'</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">UK NEWS; Version:6</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">984 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Home Office is to be given sweeping data protection exemptions that will prevent anyone seeking information about their immigration status in future, campaigners for the Windrush generation are warning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The changes due to be brought in by the data protection bill will deprive applicants of a reliable means of obtaining files about themselves from the department through what are known as subject access requests. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Challenging the Home Office's notoriously poor decision-making in immigration cases will become far more difficult and result in miscarriages of justice, civil rights groups, the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants (JCWI), lawyers and political opponents allege.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The legislation will also lower data protection standards for the Home Office, according to campaigners, so it no longer needs to handle data 'lawfully, fairly and in a transaparent way&quot;. It would not prevent the destruction of vital records such as Windrush-generation landing cards, for example. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Data will be able to be shared secretly between public services, such as the NHS, and the Home Office, more easily under the bill, it has been claimed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, said: &quot;[The] latest data protection bill shows that the Windrush scandal is not a mistake. The bill exempts immigration matters from data protection. This can be for anyone who is a migrant, or suspected of being one, as in the Windrush cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They should amend this bill. It is unacceptable that the government should be pressing ahead with legislation that allows agencies to breach data protection rights for anyone who is suspected of being a migrant. Otherwise they will show they have learned nothing, and are determined to maintain the hostile environment at whatever human cost.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Labour MP David Lammy added: &quot;The heart-breaking stories of people unjustly and unlawfully stripped of their right and held prisoner in their own country show that granting the Home Office these powers would be a significant mistake.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gracie Bradley, the advocacy officer for the human rights organisation Liberty, said:&quot;If the data protection bill's 'immigration exemption' becomes law, it will be near-impossible to challenge poor decision-making in immigration cases, or prevent the Home Office destroying evidence that could help people prove their right to be here. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And immigration enforcement teams will find it even easier to secretly access confidential information collected by trusted public services like schools and hospitals.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both main legal professional bodies, the Law Society, which represents solicitors across England and Wales, as well as the Bar Council, which represents barristers, have backed the warnings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joe Egan, the president of the Law Society, said: &quot;Recent events have shown how important it is to be able to scrutinise Home Office decision-making. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The [EU's General Data Protection Regulation] GDPR and data protection bill are based on accountability and transparency and the proposed [Home Office] exemption completely flies in the face of these principles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyone seeking their own personal data from the Home Office could be denied access without justification and with no avenue to appeal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;With serious flaws in the immigration system being exposed on a daily basis, there is deep concern about the potential for miscarriages of justice if the proposed exemptions were to be included in the final bill.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Andrew Walker QC, the chair of the Bar Council, said: &quot;It seems that the government is determined to press ahead with changes in the law that could make it even more difficult for people, including those of the Windrush generation, to demonstrate that they have the right to live in the UK. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If the new law is brought into force in the form the government wants, then those Commonwealth citizens - and many others - who are lawfully living and working in the UK will be denied the right to know what information the Home Office holds about them, which could make the difference between success and failure in a legal challenge to their wrongful detention or removal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Home Office has a notoriously bad track record for unlawful decision-making, which can have catastrophic consequences for people who are detained indefinitely in removal centres or wrongfully deported.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Law Society and Bar Council are calling for the Home Office's proposed exemptions to be removed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The JCWI has highlighted the case of Michael Braithwaite, a special needs teaching assistant who lost his job after being wrongly classified as an illegal immigrant. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only way his lawyer was able to prove his status was to ask for his case file to be handed over by the Home Office through a subject access request - a common practice in challenging immigration decisions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The3million group, which campaigns for EU citizens rights post Brexit, and the Open Rights Group have already threatened legal action, through the law firm Leigh Day, if the Home Office exemptions become law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If the department make a mistake in an application for settled status, the organisations say, individuals will be unable to obtain the data to see how the rejection decision was arrived at, leaving them unable to fight to have their legitimate right to be in the country reinstated. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Home Office has established a team to help obtain documentation for Windrush generation applicants seeking to prove their legal status.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Home Office spokesperson said: &quot;It is wrong to say that the proposed narrow exemption in the Data Protection bill is an attempt to deny people access to their data. People will still be able to request data as they can now and will be met in all cases except where we to do so could undermine our immigration control. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They will have the right to complain to the information commissioner if they disagree with any use of the immigration exemption and we would always want to assist those whose claims are in question.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A website that allows users to create, promote and sell tickets to events has apologised to users for a clause in its terms of service that allowed it to attend, film and use the footage for its own purposes. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eventbrite hosts more than 2m events a year, ranging from small free gatherings of friends to large paid-for conferences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Buried near the bottom of the website's 10,000-word merchant agreement was a section titled &quot;Permissions you grant us to film and record your events&quot;. It gave Eventbrite wide-ranging powers to use private events for its own purposes, including in adverts for the site.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The terms and conditions also allowed the company to film behind the scenes as an event was being set up or packed away, and required event hosts to obtain, at their own expense, all the &quot;permissions, clearances and licenses&quot; required to allow Eventbrite to do what it wanted, and left the question of whether it had to even credit performers or hosts &quot;in its discretion&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The clause, which affected the British version of the site as well as the American, was added to the merchant agreement at the beginning of April, but it took until Friday for user Barney Dellar to bring the rights grab to wider attention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eventbrite apologised for the clause on Sunday night, and removed it from its site. A spokeswoman told the Guardian: &quot;Earlier this month we made an update to our terms of service and merchant agreement that would allow us the option to work with individual organisers to secure video and photos at their events for marketing and promotional purposes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've heard some concerns from our customers and agree that the language of the terms went broader than necessary given our intention of the clause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have not recorded any footage at events since this clause was added, and upon further review, have removed it entirely from both our terms of service and merchant agreement. We sincerely apologise for any concern this caused.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many companies are rushing out large updates to their terms of service in the runup to 25 May, the enforcement date for Europe's general data protection regulation (GDPR), which strengthens individuals' data protection rights. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the last week, Facebook, Tumblr, and Airbnb have all notified users of their new terms of service.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How many mailing lists have you subscribed to?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chances are your email address will be on at least one or two - often the result of forgetting to untick that box when making a purchase, or a sacrifice you've made at some point for a freebie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, on 25 May, data protection rules are changing.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One this date, new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) comes into force, and will be the biggest shake-up to data privacy in 20 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It means that companies based in the EU won't be allowed to keep sending you emails based on a box you ticked 10 years ago, unless you specifically say you want to keep getting them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It comes after the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) - the UK's data watchdog - found 75% of adults don't trust businesses with their personal information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Not all contracts are legally binding - what happened when James' broadband bill went up 30% overnight                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the next few weeks, all websites - including fashion and travel firms - will be getting in touch with you to reconfirm your place on their mailing lists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You'll be asked to opt-in or opt-out, giving you the chance to rethink where your information is shared, and how.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you are no longer interested, they'll have to remove your details, if you don't act at all, you'll be removed permanently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The person responsible for all this in the UK will be ICO commissioner Elizabeth Denham.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;GDPR rebalances the relationship between individuals and organisations. It gives greater control to people over how their data is used, and compels organisations to be transparent and account for their actions,&quot; explained Denham.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Those that merely comply, that treat the GDPR as another box-ticking exercise, miss the point. And they miss a trick because this is about restoring trust and confidence. Only one in five people in the UK trust organisations to look after their data. That's not good enough,&quot; she added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new GDPR rules will change how businesses and public sector organisations handle your information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The legislation is designed to &quot;harmonise&quot; data privacy as well as give greater protection and rights to individuals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It follows a stream of high profile data breaches over the past few years that have ranged from Equifax to Tesco Bank, Yahoo, TalkTalk, Wonga and even KFC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More recently, political consultancyCambridge Analyticacame under fire for using data from millions ofFacebookpages without consent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Combined, these cases have raised huge questions over the use of our data, who's sharing it and where it's landing. It also comes afteridentity fraud hit a record high in the UK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From 25 May, all companies that have more than 250 employees, will need to have documentation of why people's information is being collected and processed, descriptions of the information that's held, how long it's being kept for and descriptions of technical security measures in place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Millions of people are on mailing lists they either a) can't remember joining or b) don't want to be on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new rules mean firms have until the deadline to give you a choice of whether you want to be in, or out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You'll be sent an email over the next few weeks from all companies that fall into this bracket asking you to update your choice. It means more freedom to you and an opportunity to rethink any data sharing you're not happy about.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also means fewer spam calls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you've ever received a PPI or car accident compensation call, the chances are your details will have been sourced from a mailing list or subscription of some sort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opting out of unwanted lists means you'll be chased less, reducing your risk of fraud.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lastly, the new rules also state firms will have to be transparent, informed and unambiguous about their terms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This means if you decide you do want to continue, you'll be able to see exactly what will happen with your data afterwards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guidelines around how to withdraw from the lists must also be clear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new data protection rules are hugely welcome and long overdue (they were last updated in 1998).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, opting out in haste could mean you lock yourself out of lots of deals, promotions and ways to save money, such as voucher codes websites and retailers, like Argos for instance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you receive an email asking you to act now, read the small print (remember, they have to be transparent about it) and consider where you stand. If you want in, make it clear; if you want out, opt-out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you choose to ignore the email, however, you'll be automatically removed from any mailing lists and therefore left completely out of the loop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So in short:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Submit it - don't ignore it</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Google's parent company Alphabet saw profits soar&nbsp;73pc in its first quarter, thanks to an increase in advertising income, with no sign that privacy concerns were starting to feed through to its bottom line.&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alphabet said it generated $31bn (&pound;22.2bn) in revenue in the three months to March 31, pushing net income up 73pc to $9.4bn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Around 85pc of its revenue came from advertising in the period, equal to&nbsp;$26.6bn, while its 'Other Bets' division, which includes businesses such as its Waymo self-driving firm, posted revenue of $150m, up from $132m a year earlier.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, although earnings&nbsp;beat analyst expectations, Alphabet's operating profit margin dipped to 22pc from 27pc a year earlier, causing shares&nbsp;to seesaw in extended trade, jumping as much as 4pc before falling back down to trade up 0.4pc. &nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The results come amid mounting concerns in the wider tech industry over user privacy, in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica data revelations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Technology companies are &nbsp;currently preparing for the introduction of the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation next month, which will give users greater control over their data, but could affect how businesses&nbsp;such as Google&nbsp;target adverts at users and use&nbsp;bought-in data from advertisers and publishers.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Google chief executive Sundar Pichai said the group started working on GDPR compliance &quot;over 18 months ago&quot; and that it has been working &quot;very closely with advertisers and our partners&quot; on meeting requirements when the law comes into force, on May 25. &nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a glance | Your data rights</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest results&nbsp;also come less than a week after Google-owned YouTube faced renewed criticism from advertisers, after it emerged that it was running adverts from major brands alongside content prompting paedophilia and Nazism.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">YouTube said at the time that it had &quot;partnered with our advertisers to make significant changes to how we approach monetisation on YouTube with stricter policies, better controls and greater transparency&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When we find that ads mistakenly ran against content that doesn't comply with our policies, we immediately remove those ads. We know that even when videos meet our advertiser friendly guidelines, not all videos will be appropriate for all brands.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year, it&nbsp;was forced to refund advertisers after paid-for-clips appeared alongside extremist content.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alphabet said paid clicks on Google properties rose 59pc year on year in the first quarter, while cost-per-click, meaning how much it can charge for its adverts, was down 19pc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ruth Porat, chief financial officer of Alphabet and Google, said: &quot;Our ongoing strong revenue growth reflects our momentum globally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have a clear set of exciting opportunities ahead, and our strong growth enables us to invest in them with confidence.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Publishers claim Google is going against the spirit of new data protection rules with a plan to shelter its third party data, used for targeted advertising, from European lawmakers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The technology giant is preparing for incoming General Data Protection Regulation, which will offer Europeans greater privacy by restricting how companies use people's data from May 25.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Companies typically use third party data to match up customer databases. For example, a retailer of shoes may match a database to one about clothing purchasing habits in order to target potential shoppers with products that are relevant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Google, which describes itself as a data controller, will be held accountable if its customers abuse data it sells on under the new rules.&nbsp;Investors and analysts are hoping its latest quarterly earnings, due to be published on Monday evening, will shed light on how GDPR will affect a company so dependent on personal data and uses bought-in data from advertisers and publishers, which is applied to 1bn users. The tech giant's third party&nbsp;data&nbsp;is reported to be worth around $20bn in advertising revenue.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Google and Facebook are both taking a strategy where they are trying to protect the status quo and doing what they've done historically,&quot; Jason Kint, chief executive officer of Digital Content Next, a US trade association for online publishers, told The Financial Times .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a glance | Your data rights</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Google is also expected to reveal more details about its Uber investment after adopting a new accounting standard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parent company Alphabet will reveal first-quarter earnings at 9pm local time, after market close in the US. It will include profits or losses from non marketable stock - such as investments in startups like Uber.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alphabet's venture capital arm, known as Google Ventures or GV, which invested $258million into the ride-sharing company in 2013.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook, which will also diclose its numbers this week, stands accused of similar tactics, after weakening&nbsp;data privacy protection for 1.5bn of its users by moving their&nbsp;data to a different location.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From next month users in Africa, Asia, Australia and Latin America will no longer have the same privacy rights as Europeans, when it switches the location of where their accounts are hosted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The change affects more than 70pc of Facebook's two billion-plus members. As of December, Facebook had 239m users in the US and Canada, 370m in Europe and 1.52bn elsewhere.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GOOGLE is spying on millions of its users and keeping detailed records of web browsing stretching back nearly ten years, The Mail on Sunday has found.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The investigation uncovered how the company harvests personal information for commercial gain on a vast scale.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Using what campaigners describe as sinister surveillance' techniques, it even stores the internet histories of people who believe they are protecting their privacy by using its supposedly incognito' mode.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our reporter discovered that the web giant logged every journey he has made in the past four years, registering what time he went to work, whether he walked, ran, cycled or used public transport, and which restaurants and bars he visited. It even kept a record of a hospital visit and a funeral that he attended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He found that his internet history over the past 12 months stored by Google was the equivalent of 569,555 pages of A4 paper. If printed and stacked, it would measure more than 189ft, which is taller than the Leaning Tower of Pisa. Even over the past fortnight Google has collected 23,731 pages that would reach 7ft 9in if stacked.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last month Facebook came under fire following revelations that up to 87 million users may have had their data harvested by political marketing firm Cambridge Analytica without their consent. But the way Google systematically monitors its users is even more disturbing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former Liberal Democrat leader Lord Ashdown described the MoS's revelations as horrifying' and urged Google to pay users an annual fee for plundering their data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company amasses billions of pieces of information from people using the services it owns, including its search engine, GPS system, maps, email and YouTube.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It then uses the information to build an advertisement portfolio of its users' interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Businesses pay millions to Google to show their adverts to people whose data has indicated they may be interested in their products.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While most realise adverts they receive are often based on their search history, few will be aware of the extent to which the company tracks their every online move.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Experts have warned that Google's huge cache of data may breach new data protection regulations which are due to be introduced next month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Web developer Dylan Curran, 24, requested all the information Google holds on him and was stunned by the results.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: I work in technology and had no idea Google was harvesting this amount of information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What was particularly shocking was it had a record of websites I looked at while I was in Google's private, incognito mode.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also had files I had deleted from Google's cloud service, including an old CV, as well as every photo I had taken on my phone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's wrong to trust any entity that big with so much information. They're just trying to make money, and at some point someone is going to make a mistake.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Mail on Sunday reporter discovered Google had an exhaustive and precise record of his activities for every day since December 2014. The information included times and details of visits to restaurants, shops and bars - and the mode of transport used to get there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reporter's movements were tracked with a blue line to indicate each location visited. Google searches he had made at each location were also included.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another reporter's visit to a cemetery in Macclesfield was archived after he searched on Google's Maps app for directions to a funeral. It also saved his search for directions to a hospital in Dublin when he visited A&amp;E, and later recorded when he was discharged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lord Ashdown said: I am shocked and horrified that the personal intrusion into our lives is so deep - if this was a communist state we would not be tracked so closely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm pretty tech-savvy and was not aware of this - it's unbelievable. This Mail on Sunday investigation has revealed, in an extremely powerful way, just how intrusive and personal this is.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the moment it is a Wild West and we've let it happen because we benefit from Google and don't mind it making a bit of money. We get a free service but it is massively invasive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My proposition is we tell Google you can have my data but, should you make money from it, I require a share of the profit you make from my property - it's the same with other property we own.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If we don't agree then Google could charge us for using their service instead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wouldn't it be nice - every person in Britain would get a cheque once a year for &pound;150 from Google.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We're a property-owning democracy and at the moment we give our data away free, without informed consent - Google is making millions and millions from this. They are the masters of the commercial universe.' One expert estimated that 2.8 per cent of the world's computer storage capacity is used to store the data of Google's three billion users.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Silkie Carlo, director of privacy campaign group Big Brother Watch, said: Google's fun branding veils its frankly sinister surveillance machinery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is most people's portal to the internet, their maps, emails and phones. But not many people know that the amount of information Google collects about them is just enormous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It would be entirely possible to provide great services while protecting people's privacy. But instead, Google harvests and centralises years of information on billions of people around the globe to exploit it for profit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Should any company have that much power? The risks to individuals and to society at large are incredibly daunting.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Google says it has gained consent to gather and keep this data by asking users to tick a box when they sign up for a Google account.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But data experts complain the terms and conditions are confusing and do not state for how long it will hold their data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gini Blake, of data consultancy business GDPR Associates, said: The problem is no one reads the small print - Google could say it will come into your bedroom and nick your underwear and people would still sign up to it. Google has an army of lawyers to make sure they are loosely adhering to the letter of the law but they are not adhering to the spirit of the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I think the vast majority of people will be shocked to learn it has ten years' worth of their data. Why would something they searched for a decade ago still be relevant?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Likewise, why does Google need to know your exact location on a certain date ten years ago?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new rules being introduced in May are more draconian than the current regulations and Google may be forced to delete all the data it is storing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the new rules, data can only be stored if a user made a &quot;clear, affirmative and unambiguous&quot; consented action to have their data harvested - ticking a box with tons of small print will not be enough. They will also be forced to inform users how long they will hold on to their data. At the moment they don't do that, so they could be made to delete any information they have that was not ascertained under these new rules.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Google spokesman said people should use its My Account facility to safeguard data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: The privacy and security of our users is of the utmost importance, which is why we have spent years making available tools like My Account so people can understand and control their Google data and make the privacy choices that are right for them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We encourage everyone to review My Account regularly, and 3.8 million people did in the UK in the last year. Your data makes things like Google Maps work better and more effectively, by helping to do things like recognising traffic patterns and help you find the quickest way home.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">staggering</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">looking at my data from December 23, 2014, I saw Google recorded that I left my street in South-East London, below, at 11.31am and, tracking me via GPS, it knew that it took me seven minutes to walk to Lee station. Google then noted that I boarded the 11.39 train to Charing Cross, arriving at 11.57. While on the train, at 11.47, Google recorded that I searched the term best whisky shop in London' to buy whisky for my father. And at 11.53, the search engine kept a record of the fact that I read a review of 2014 by Charlie Brooker, right, in the Guardian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Google kept a note that I made the four-minute walk to the Whisky Exchange in Bedford Street, Covent Garden. Still tracking my movements, the tech giant recorded the fact I was in the shop browsing between 12.01pm and 12.31. But it also knew that at 12.17 I searched reviews for Glen Garioch and Glen Moray before buying a bottle of the latter, left.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I WAS tracked again after this, making an 11-minute walk to Pret A Manger on The Strand where I arrived at 12.42. I was preparing for a job interview, so at 12.46 Google kept a note of the fact that I read several articles about what to expect from the interview and testimonies of previous applicants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Google registered that I then walked for eight minutes, arriving at Runners Need, above, on Waterloo Bridge. It noted that I was there between 12.58 and 13.16 and bought some socks. Google tracked me again after this on a five-minute walk, also registering that I arrived at the shop Aspinal of London in Long Acre, Covent Garden, right. Google kept a note of the fact I was there between 13.21 and 13.54.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MY movements were recorded again, noting that I walked to Costa on The Strand where I had a coffee between 14.08 and 14.26. It recorded I browsed the BBC News website at 14.14 and that I took the 14.26 train from Charing Cross to Lee, arriving home at 14.53.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1155 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Data security is a hot topic, as social media giants try to explain how the ultimate Big Brother has gained access to information many thought was available only to a few select friends. While Facebook and Cambridge Analytica still have some explaining to do, new EU rules come into operation on May 25 that will affect all of us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) gives consumers the right to access information stored about them, makes it mandatory for businesses to keep data securely and will impose financial punishment on anyone found to be breaking the rules. It will be effective in all areas of public life and will change the way in which we buy and sell houses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What information do estate agents have on me? Estate agents hold basic information about their clients and in some cases may store confidential data regarding a client's financial status, creditworthiness and ability to pay for a property. Homehunters may also leave a trail relating to properties they have viewed that could reveal aspects about their preferences.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coupled with personal details, this all adds up to a great deal of information and the new rules will mean that agents must be able to show clients how they plan to keep it securely, how long it will be on file and whether or not it will be used for future marketing purposes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gr&iacute;ana O'Kelly, of Lavelle Solicitors in Dublin, says transparency is a central principle of the regulation. &quot;There must be a lawful basis for processing data,&quot; she says. &quot;Apart from consent, estate agents will have contracts with individuals regarding a property, and the performance of these contracts will form the legal basis for processing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;However, agents still need to inform individuals in advance as to the 'why, how and when' of their processing. 'Why' means purpose, 'how' means how their data will be used and 'when' means how long their data will be retained - and agents should understand that personal data processing covers any information about a living individual that they store.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Estate agents and letting companies collect and retain a high level of data as part of their required records when they are buying, selling, renting, letting or managing a property. Under the Property Services Regulations, the information they acquire from clients is extensive and often sensitive, and under the new regulation this data must be protected to a high level or companies face hefty fines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What will agents have to pay? &quot;Property service providers are only now becoming aware of their obligations on the impending regulation and the impact it will have on their business,&quot; says Paul McCourtney, chief executive of the Data Protection Group, a company that helps businesses comply with the regulations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Companies that are not ready for the new regulations may face a fine of up to (EURO)20m or 4% of global turnover, whichever is greater. If a breach takes place and it does not inform the Data Protection Commission's office within 72 hours, it may face a fine of up to (EURO)10m or 2% of global turnover, whichever is greater, or it may be ordered to stop processing customer's data, which could be catastrophic for any business. Allied to this, the regulations give individuals an automatic right to legal recourse if their data is breached.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, the new ePrivacy regulations - which also affect marketing - are being drafted and are expected to accompany the new rules.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Will this change how agents carry out marketing? McCourtney says that, previously, marketers could use a &quot;soft opt-in&quot; or &quot;single opt-in&quot; approach to justify marketing and direct-mailing activities, but this is no longer the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Under both of the new regulations, consumers must actively choose to receive marketing materials,&quot; he says. &quot;It is no longer acceptable to rely on disclaimers or implied consent, and the marketer must be able to prove they acquired the recipient's permission to be contacted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is especially relevant to property service providers that collect information of purchasers looking to buy and tenants looking to rent, whether for residential, commercial or investment purposes. Clear understanding of the data collected and purposes and permission to contact/market must be obtained and be able to be demonstrated.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Information relating to consent must include the time and date that the recipient agreed to be contacted, as well as the method used to acquire their consent. Fines for failing to follow these new guidelines will also be imposed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What do agents need to do? Before the deadline next month, O'Kelly says property businesses should review the types of data they hold and what their legal basis is for holding it. &quot;They may have mailing lists containing personal data of individuals who may have instructed the firm many years ago and the legal basis for processing that information will be a key change under GDPR,&quot; she says. &quot;The consent for such processing is likely to require an update, as even if consent was obtained initially, it is unlikely to meet standards now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new ruling also states that while clients must give consent for their information to be stored, they can also ask for this to be overturned in the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Once consent is given it can also be withdrawn,&quot; says O'Kelly &quot;The agent must facilitate this and must communicate the data subject's right to withdraw consent at the outset. The easiest way of doing this is to provide all customers with a simple and accessible way to opt out of the mailing list.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Will the new rules really affect me? If you think the regulations will stop estate agents' leaflets clogging up your letterbox, think again. They don't need personal data to do mailshots. However, buyers and sellers will become more aware of their rights and O'Kelly says this is a welcome move.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It gives customers more control over their data, as they must be told in advance why it is being collected, how it will be used and how long for,&quot; she says. &quot;Information must be available to customers in clear language and be easily accessible. Additionally, their positive consent must be obtained for each specified purpose - so, if their data is provided initially to an agent for the purpose of selling their property, customers must give specific consent if that data will be processed for another purpose such as a mailing list.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is because the purpose of processing by the estate agent will be different in each case. Customers can contact an organisation that holds their data and ask for it to be deleted. They can also request that their personal data is amended if it is incorrect.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McCourtney echoes this positive note. &quot;All of this will affect companies working in the property sector that collect data on individuals, whether, they are buyers, sellers, landlords or tenants,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Times have changed and we all need to change with the times.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Companies that are not ready for the new regulations may face a fine of up to (EURO)20m</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">TECHNOLOGY INTELLIGENCE; Version:1</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">908 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mark Zuckerberg's 10 hours of questioning by US politicians, carried out over two marathon sessions in Washington this month, was striking for how little we learned. Many of the senators and congressmen questioning Facebook's founder seemed to lack the most rudimentary understanding of how social media functions, and those who did dedicated much of their allotted time to grandstanding, rather than forensic scrutiny.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But we did at least learn one thing: Zuckerberg is not, on the face of it, opposed to the social media regulation that so many desire. He admitted that &quot;I think there are going to be... places where there needs to be more regulation&quot;, and said he was &quot;not the type of person that thinks all regulation is bad&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was a deft move because it appeared to defuse a charge levelled against Zuckerberg and many of his fellow Silicon Valley leaders: that they are fundamentally hostile to regulation, see new laws as hindering progress, and generally believe governments should get out of their way. Like all caricatures, there is some truth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regulation is often viewed with suspicion by the tech community. But not always. Facebook and Twitter, for example, have been open in their support for proposed US legislation that would force social media companies to disclose who has paid for political adverts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zuckerberg, in his Washington hearings this month, had warm words for new European data laws known as the GDPR that will be applied from next month. &quot;I think they [the Europeans] get things right,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mark Zuckerburg faces Congress | The six questions that left us wincing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was striking because the GDPR is a potentially ominous new landscape for Silicon Valley's giants. It gives internet users much stricter controls over how their data is shared, stored and processed, and forces companies to be clearer about how they collect it. Failures can result in fines of up to 4pc of annual turnover, a sum of over $1.6bn (&pound;1.1bn) in Facebook's case. The company has even admitted that the regulations could affect user numbers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So what explains the sudden support for it? Some Damascene conversion? Is Zuckerberg ready to cede power to legislation, and admit the limits of Facebook's ability to police its own domain? This seems unlikely. Such control is rarely given up willingly, especially in Europe, where politicians have proven more eager than their US counterparts&nbsp;to fine technology companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, we must consider the alternative. The reason Zuckerberg welcomes regulation is because it benefits him to do so. New rules on internet companies, rather than cutting Facebook down to size, could well do the opposite, entrenching their power and making it more difficult for competitors to spring up. Take Facebook's controversy, which centres on how the political consultants Cambridge Analytica exploited the social network to obtain private data of 87m users .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of that data was exposed not through fault of the people affected, but because they were friends with someone who downloaded a particular app. The scandal is that Facebook data ended up in the wrong people's hands, not that it had it in the first place. The company's response has been to lock down the social network; making changes that prevent other parties from accessing user data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Any regulations that stem from the controversy will be about stopping companies like Facebook from sharing the information they have on citizens. It is a laudable aim, but at the same time, it bolsters those who already have the most valuable warchests of personal data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook | Mark Zuckerberg faces Congress</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook, in particular, seems to regard the new laws as an opportunity, rather than a threat. Last week it began asking users in Europe to give Facebook permission to apply facial recognition to their profiles. It has not used facial recognition in Europe for the past six years, but a GDPR-inspired privacy overhaul has given it the chance to turn it back on, provided that users consent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the company is shifting the responsibility for handling the data of 1.5bn users outside of Europe, currently governed at its international base in Dublin, to the US in order to exempt them from the new European rules. Only a company of Facebook's size and resources&nbsp;would be able to do this at the drop of a hat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the unintended consequence of new internet regulations: those with the biggest pockets are in the best position to comply, and those who have built&nbsp;up a dominant position are able to pull up the ladder behind them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the challenger that one day might dethrone Facebook is hobbled. Europe's new data laws attempt to address this, demanding that users can &quot;port&quot; their information from one service to another, but the social networks have not agreed how this might work in practice, making a mockery of the idea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Technology intelligence - newsletter promo - EOA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is another reason Facebook may not oppose regulation: the alternative is worse. It&nbsp;owns three of the biggest social apps - Facebook itself, Instagram and WhatsApp - which will all have more than 1bn users by the end of the year. It would rather be contending with new laws than discuss monopolies. Facebook did not replace MySpace because the latter was regulated, but because it created something better. Today's attempts to rein in Zuckerberg's company may present a challenge to Facebook, but they will also make it more difficult for any upstart to topple it.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Google is spying on millions of its users and keeping detailed records of web browsing stretching back nearly ten years, The Mail on Sunday has found.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The investigation uncovered how the company harvests personal information for commercial gain on a vast scale.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Using what campaigners describe as 'sinister surveillance' techniques, it even stores the internet histories of people who believe they are protecting their privacy by using its supposedly 'incognito' mode.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our reporter discovered that the web giant logged every journey he has made in the past four years, registering what time he went to work, whether he walked, ran, cycled or used public transport, and which restaurants and bars he visited.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It even kept a record of a hospital visit and a funeral that he attended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He found that his internet history over the past 12 months stored by Google was the equivalent of 569,555 pages of A4 paper.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If printed and stacked, it would measure more than 189ft, which is taller than the Leaning Tower of Pisa.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even over the past fortnight Google has collected 23,731 pages that would reach 7ft 9in if stacked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last month Facebook came under fire following revelations that up to 87 million users may have had their data harvested by political marketing firm Cambridge Analytica without their consent.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the way Google systematically monitors its users is even more disturbing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former Liberal Democrat leader Lord Ashdown described the MoS's revelations as 'horrifying' and urged Google to pay users an annual fee for plundering their data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company amasses billions of pieces of information from people using the services it owns, including its search engine, GPS system, maps, email and YouTube.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It then uses the information to build an advertisement portfolio of its users' interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Businesses pay millions to Google to show their adverts to people whose data has indicated they may be interested in their products.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While most realise adverts they receive are often based on their search history, few will be aware of the extent to which the company tracks their every online move.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Experts have warned that Google's huge cache of data may breach new data protection regulations which are due to be introduced next month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Web developer Dylan Curran, 24, requested all the information Google holds on him and was stunned by the results.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: 'I work in technology and had no idea Google was harvesting this amount of information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'What was particularly shocking was it had a record of websites I looked at while I was in Google's private, incognito mode.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'It also had files I had deleted from Google's cloud service, including an old CV, as well as every photo I had taken on my phone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'It's wrong to trust any entity that big with so much information. They're just trying to make money, and at some point someone is going to make a mistake.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Mail on Sunday reporter discovered Google had an exhaustive and precise record of his activities for every day since December 2014.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The information included times and details of visits to restaurants, shops and bars - and the mode of transport used to get there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reporter's movements were tracked with a blue line to indicate each location visited. Google searches he had made at each location were also included.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another reporter's visit to a cemetery in Macclesfield was archived after he searched on Google's Maps app for directions to a funeral.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also saved his search for directions to a hospital in Dublin when he visited A&amp;E, and later recorded when he was discharged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lord Ashdown said: 'I am shocked and horrified that the personal intrusion into our lives is so deep - if this was a communist state we would not be tracked so closely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I'm pretty tech-savvy and was not aware of this - it's unbelievable. This Mail on Sunday investigation has revealed, in an extremely powerful way, just how intrusive and personal this is.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'At the moment it is a Wild West and we've let it happen because we benefit from Google and don't mind it making a bit of money. We get a free service but it is massively invasive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'My proposition is we tell Google you can have my data but, should you make money from it, I require a share of the profit you make from my property - it's the same with other property we own.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'If we don't agree then Google could charge us for using their service instead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Wouldn't it be nice - every person in Britain would get a cheque once a year for &pound;150 from Google.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We're a property-owning democracy and at the moment we give our data away free, without informed consent - Google is making millions and millions from this.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'They are the masters of the commercial universe.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One expert estimated that 2.8 per cent of the world's computer storage capacity is used to store the data of Google's three billion users.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Silkie Carlo, director of privacy campaign group Big Brother Watch, said: 'Google's fun branding veils its frankly sinister surveillance machinery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'It is most people's portal to the internet, their maps, emails and phones. But not many people know that the amount of information Google collects about them is just enormous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'It would be entirely possible to provide great services while protecting people's privacy. But instead, Google harvests and centralises years of information on billions of people around the globe to exploit it for profit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Should any company have that much power? The risks to individuals and to society at large are incredibly daunting.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Google says it has gained consent to gather and keep this data by asking users to tick a box when they sign up for a Google account.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But data experts complain the terms and conditions are confusing and do not state for how long it will hold their data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gini Blake, of data consultancy business GDPR Associates, said: 'The problem is no one reads the small print - Google could say it will come into your bedroom and nick your underwear and people would still sign up to it.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Google has an army of lawyers to make sure they are loosely adhering to the letter of the law but they are not adhering to the spirit of the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I think the vast majority of people will be shocked to learn it has ten years' worth of their data. Why would something they searched for a decade ago still be relevant?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Likewise, why does Google need to know your exact location on a certain date ten years ago?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'The new rules being introduced in May are more draconian than the current regulations and Google may be forced to delete all the data it is storing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Under the new rules, data can only be stored if a user made a &quot;clear, affirmative and unambiguous&quot; consented action to have their data harvested - ticking a box with tons of small print will not be enough.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They will also be forced to inform users how long they will hold on to their data.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the moment they don't do that, so they could be made to delete any information they have that was not ascertained under these new rules.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Google spokesman said people should use its My Account facility to safeguard data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: 'The privacy and security of our users is of the utmost importance, which is why we have spent years making available tools like My Account so people can understand and control their Google data and make the privacy choices that are right for them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We encourage everyone to review My Account regularly, and 3.8 million people did in the UK in the last year.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Your data makes things like Google Maps work better and more effectively, by helping to do things like recognising traffic patterns and help you find the quickest way home.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     And look what they know about just three hours of our man's life... four years ago                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">11:31 - They know what you want and exactly where you go&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Looking at my data from December 23, 2014, I saw Google recorded that I left my street in South-East London at 11.31am and, tracking me via GPS, it knew that it took me seven minutes to walk to Lee station.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Google then noted that I boarded the 11.39 train to Charing Cross, arriving at 11.57.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While on the train, at 11.47, Google recorded that I searched the term 'best whisky shop in London' to buy whisky for my father.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And at 11.53, the search engine kept a record of the fact that I read a review of 2014 by Charlie Brooker in the Guardian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">11:57 - They know what you drink</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Google kept a note that I made the four-minute walk to the Whisky Exchange in Bedford Street, Covent Garden.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still tracking my movements, the tech giant recorded the fact I was in the shop browsing between 12.01pm and 12.31.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it also knew that at 12.17 I searched reviews for Glen Garioch and Glen Moray before buying a bottle of the latter, left.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">12:31 - They know what you eat&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I was tracked again after this, making an 11-minute walk to Pret A Manger on The Strand where I arrived at 12.42.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I was preparing for a job interview, so at 12.46 Google kept a note of the fact that I read several articles about what to expect from the interview and testimonies of previous applicants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">12:50 - They know where you shop and what you buy&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Google registered that I then walked for eight minutes, arriving at Runners Need, above, on Waterloo Bridge.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It noted that I was there between 12.58 and 13.16 and bought some socks.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Google tracked me again after this on a five-minute walk, also registering that I arrived at the shop Aspinal of London in Long Acre, Covent Garden.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Google kept a note of the fact I was there between 13.21 and 13.54.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">13:54 - They know what you read and where you live</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My movements were recorded again, noting that I walked to Costa on The Strand where I had a coffee between 14.08 and 14.26.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It recorded I browsed the BBC News website at 14.14 and that I took the 14.26 train from Charing Cross to Lee, arriving home at 14.53.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FACEBOOK is taking measures to shield 1.5bn of its users from incoming European data protection law, greatly reducing their privacy rights. From next month users in Africa, Asia, Australia and Latin America will no longer have the same privacy rights as Europeans, when it switches the site where their accounts are hosted.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The move appears to be an attempt to reduce its liability under the incoming General Data Protection Regulation, which restricts what companies can do with people's data. Facebook faces fines up to around $1.1bn (&pound;770m) if found to be in breach of the law, which comes into effect on May 25.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Services for all its users bar Americans and Canadians are stored in Ireland, its EU headquarters, but its plans would keep all those not based in Europe from the scrutiny of European officials, reducing the firm's exposure to huge fines, Reuters reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The change affects more than 70pc of Facebook's two billion-plus members. As of December, Facebook had 239m users in the US and Canada, 370m in Europe and 1.52bn elsewhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook told Reuters it plans to make the privacy controls and settings that Europe will get under GDPR available to the rest of the world. &quot;We apply the same privacy protections everywhere, regardless of whether your agreement is with Facebook Inc or Facebook Ireland,&quot; the company said. Meanwhile, continued fallout from the Cambridge Analytica data-sharing scandal continued with new research that claimed by logging into websites or apps using a Facebook account, millions may have been exposed to big data companies quietly mining their personal information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marketing companies embedded in websites that use the &quot;sign in with Facebook&quot; function, were able to collect names, email addresses and in some cases track people around the web, privacy engineer and Princeton PhD student Steven Englehardt has found. Mr Englehardt, along with researchers Gunes Acar, and Arvind Narayanan, found seven third-parties abusing websites' access to Facebook user data with one using its own Facebook &quot;application&quot; to track users around the web.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These included www.OnAudience.com, Lytics and Tealium, which offer companies' data sets to pad out their own customer information collection. If a company wants to know more about a customer, it can cross-examine its database to pad out any missing parts.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Tribute Money (1560-8) by Titian  This may be the clearest gesture ever painted. As the pharisees ask Christ if they should pay the Romans their tax, he points up at heaven. It is a perfect visual expression of the words the New Testament gives him: &quot;Render therefore unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's.&quot; Titian is an artist of such acute psychological realism that he makes this completely natural and human. Christ is coolly authoritative. The most subtle touch is that the pharisees are sympathetic - they look like they really need to know. One has glasses to show his lack of vision, the other is a long-bearded ascetic seeking knowledge.

Masterpiece of the week The Tribute Money (1560-8) by Titian This may be the clearest gesture ever painted. As the pharisees ask Christ if they should pay the Romans their tax, he points up at heaven. It is a perfect visual expression of the words the New Testament gives him: &quot;Render therefore unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's.&quot; Titian is an artist of such acute psychological realism that he makes this completely natural and human. Christ is coolly authoritative. The most subtle touch is that the pharisees are sympathetic - they look like they really need to know. One has glasses to show his lack of vision, the other is a long-bearded ascetic seeking knowledge. The young, good-looking Christ shows them the truth with one finger. &middot; National Gallery, London.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hello, it's Warren Murray with the round-up to round out your week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The people of Salisbury have been warned their city may still be contaminated with potentially lethal quantities of the novichok nerve agent used to poison the Skripals. &quot;The chemical does not degrade quickly. You can assume that it is not much different now from the day it was distributed,&quot; a government scientist has told a public meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ian Boyd, the chief scientific adviser at Defra, likened it to the spread of ink on someone's finger. &quot;If that ink doesn't dry and you go through your normal daily activities, you will find that ink in a lot of different places. Ink is OK - you can see it. We're dealing with a chemical that you cannot see.&quot; Answering criticism of the time the clean-up is taking, Boyd said: &quot;We have to make the assumption that there are still hotspots to find ... The deeper you look into this, the more complicated it is.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police and council officials are being moved out of offices at Bourne Hill in the city for eight weeks so that they can be decontaminated and deep-cleaned; a police evidence store also needs decontamination, along with ambulance stations at Salisbury and Amesbury, and the home of DS Nick Bailey, who fell ill after responding to the attack. Other locations include the Maltings park where the Skripals fell ill; and the Mill pub and Zizzi restaurant they visited. Investigations are still taking place at Sergei Skripal's home and any clean-up there remains some weeks away. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Windrush scandal -  Days after the government apologised to Caribbean-born British citizens, Albert Thompson is still waiting for a call to confirm he will get NHS radiotherapy for his cancer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The prime minister said I would get treatment, so I presume it is true, but I won't believe it until I get the go-ahead for the treatment,&quot; Thompson said. Other Caribbean-born Britons - some of whom arrived as far back as the 1950s - have told how holidays turned into exile when they travelled abroad and were denied re-entry to the UK. Meanwhile official accounts reveal that as home secretary, Theresa May agreed to a package of immigration measures including vans with &quot;Go home&quot; signs being driven around London boroughs - contradicting a former adviser who said she tried to stop it. Gary Younge writes this morning that rightful outrage about the exclusion of &quot;worthy immigrants&quot; must not obscure that &quot; outrageous immigration policies made such exclusion possible and will continue to exclude others deemed 'unworthy'&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Brexit's hidden figures -  The Brexit divorce bill could be billions more than the government thinks once a range of currently unknown liabilities come into play, the National Audit Office has warned. While it calls the Treasury's &pound;35bn-&pound;39bn guesstimate &quot;reasonable&quot;, the NAO says there might be at least another &pound;5.9bn in contributions to make before leaving. It warns that the European commission could &quot;skew future decisions&quot; to affect the amount Britain pays back. Meg Hillier, the Labour chair of the public accounts committee, said Brexiters had promised a &quot;bounty&quot; for public services but now &quot;I fear the cost of the UK leaving the EU could increase further&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     About-face on privacy -  Having told lawmakers it will respect the &quot;spirit&quot; of the new European data privacy regime globally, Facebook has moved 1.5bn users to its American servers, where the GDPR doesn't apply. Facebook has insisted to the Guardian that all users will still have the same protection, and the move is taking place because of &quot;specific wording&quot; required by the EU for privacy notices. Privacy researcher Lukasz Olejnik disagrees: &quot;Users will clearly lose some existing rights, as US standards are lower than those in Europe. Data protection authorities from the countries of the affected users, such as New Zealand and Australia, may want to reassess this situation.&quot; </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Worker rights 'burdensome' -  The World Bank has alarmed unions and the International Labour Organisation with a proposal for companies to be able to pay as little as they want and fire workers at will. A draft of its World Development Report chafes like a multinational CEO at &quot;burdensome regulations ... high minimum wages, undue restrictions on hiring and firing, and strict contract forms&quot;. The International Trade Union Confederation says the report almost completely ignores workers' rights and social protections - taking as a given unfair employment practices like zero-hours contracts and Uber-style &quot;contractor&quot; arrangements rather than challenging them. The World Bank says it is aimed at &quot;stimulating debate&quot;. The final report is due in the autumn. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     'She wore it well' -  There was a stir but no feathers were ruffled when the New Zealand prime minister wore a traditional Maori cloak to Buckingham Palace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Kahu huruhuru is bedecked with bird feathers and symbolises leadership, prestige and power - fitting for Jacinda Ardern, who has just been named by Time magazine as one of the top 100 influential people in the world. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   Lunchtime read: Communist Manifesto comes to life                    </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Was the Communist Manifesto right after all? It would be hard, argues Yanis Varoufakis, to read Marx and Engels' examination of the capitalism and its end-game, apply it to today's world and think otherwise. Society has indeed &quot;conjured up gigantic means of production and of exchange&quot;, becoming &quot;like the sorcerer who is no longer able to control the powers of the nether world whom he has called up by his spells&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Marx and Engels want us to realise that capitalism is insufficiently evolved to survive the technologies it spawns,&quot; writes Varoufakis. &quot;Capital's success at spreading its reach via accumulation for accumulation's sake is causing human workers to work like machines for a pittance, while the robots are programmed to produce stuff that the workers can no longer afford and the robots do not need.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The workers' states inspired by the manifesto are almost gone, and the communist parties disbanded or in disarray. Liberated from competition with regimes inspired by the manifesto, globalised capitalism is behaving as if it is determined to create a world best explained by the manifesto.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   Sport                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The British marathon record holder Steve Jones fears Mo Farah will always be tainted by his association with Alberto Salazar - and says he wishes he had left his former coach years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Victor Moses struck to give Chelsea a 2-1 win over Burnley in the Premier League last night, while a goalless stalemate at Leicester left Southampton's hopes of survival hanging by a thread. Lance Armstrong has reached a $5m settlement with the federal government in a whistleblower lawsuit that could have sought $100m in damages from the cyclist who was stripped of his record seven Tour de France victories. And the 50,000 fun runners taking part in the London Marathon on Sunday have been urged to go slower than planned and avoid fancy dress on what is expected to be the hottest day in the race's history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   Business                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shares were lower in Asia after a major supplier to Apple forecast continued weak demand for mobile devices. A warning by the head of the IMF over the potential for trade tensions to harm global growth also weighed on sentiment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amber Rudd, already under pressure over Windrush, now faces demands from leaver ministers to speed up the tabling of the Brexit immigration bill, the Times reports. The Telegraph says &quot;Ireland Brexit proposal in tatters&quot; as it reports that Theresa May's ideas to avoid a hard border have been subjected to a &quot;systematic and forensic annihilation&quot; by the EU. The Guardian leads on Windrush victim Albert Thompson still receiving &quot;no clarity, no urgency&quot; about his cancer treatment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Stop this injustice&quot; blasts the Express as it fumes that the cost of receiving social care has become a &quot;postcode lottery&quot;. The Mail 's got the story about the Save the Children chairman quitting over his handling of a sex scandal.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook has changed its terms of service to move more than 1.5 billion users outside the jurisdiction of European privacy laws before restrictions on data protection come into effect next month.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Responsibility for all users outside the US, Canada and the EU will now fall to Facebook's main offices in California, having previously been held by its international hub in Ireland. This means that data belonging to 1.5 billion of the site's 1.9 billion users will be on a site governed by US law, rather than Irish, or EU, law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The change in terms and conditions was made before the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe takes effect on May 25. The laws will allow European regulators to fine companies for collecting or using personal data without consent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook could be fined up to 4 per cent of its global turnover, which is an estimated $1.6 billion, if it breaks the terms of the regulation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FACEBOOK has made sweeping changes to its service in a bid to toe the line with incoming data protection law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These include asking permission to use facial recognition technology on a users' photos, and limiting what younger people can share under the General Data Protection Regulation, which will crack down on the way businesses collect and share information from May 25.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It will stop teenagers from sharing religious and sexual preferences without parental permission, and grant the option for people of all ages to review whether they want Facebook to use data collected from third parties to target them with advertising.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook faces a maximum fine of $1.1bn (&pound;777m) if found to be in breach of the GDPR by officials in Ireland, where it is based. It is applying the new privacy controls worldwide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under GDPR, people under 15 will need permission from a parent or guardian to allow some features on Facebook like seeing ads based on data from partners and including religious and political views or &quot;interested in&quot; on their profile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Teenagers can nominate someone to approve sharing these preferences by selecting someone from their friends list or by entering an email address. Facebook will not independently verify the nominee is their parent or guardian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook's chief privacy officer Erin Egan said: &quot;As soon as GDPR was finalised, we realised it was an opportunity to invest even more heavily in privacy. We not only want to comply with the law, but also go beyond our obligations to build new and improved privacy experiences for everyone on Facebook.&quot; Anne Longfield, Children's Commissioner, said she was pleased that Facebook was doing more to make the platform more suitable for teens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I still think they can do more to deal with those under 13 who use their sites, and despite moves to create spaces more suited to 13-15-year-olds, I have yet to see an online age verification system, or age related designs, that are not still open to being got around by a savvy digital native, which most teens are.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The changes follow tough questions from US lawmakers over how it allowed apps to mine the personal information of 87m unsuspecting users and later sell this to Cambridge Analytica.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The European Parliament yesterday condemned Mr Zuckerberg for declining an invitation to go to Brussels to explain himself. The billionaire appeared in Congress in the US, but despite having a larger audience in Europe, refused to catch a flight to testify. Instead, he invited a European data privacy chief to California.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Belgian politician Helga Stevens warned that &quot;Facebook has more users in Europe than the US, therefore it has responsibilities here&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">William Legge, the Earl of Dartmouth, condemned Mr Zuckerberg's role in the data debacle, claiming: &quot;Facebook has become like a virus that you cannot get rid of. Not only is it distasteful, it is entirely shocking. The problem is not Cambridge Analytica, the problem is Facebook, and the focus on Cambridge Analytica and political meddling is a distraction.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GETTY</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The EU's GDPR could cost British businesses &pound;23.6million                                            </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The General Data Protection Regulation comes into effect on May 25 2018 and British businesses breaching the rules could be fined &pound;23.6 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GDPR is essentially new rules for data protection replacing the 1998 Data Protection Act which UK law is currently based upon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And with Britain not leaving the EU until the transition period ends in 2021, the new rules require all businesses to protect and properly manage all customer privacy data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Szehofner, partner at Gordon Dadds financial markets, a London based law firm said: &quot;Larger organisations are more aware than small and medium-sized enterprises .</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think there is a lot of confusion for some firms and they are not sure what to do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Pleading ignorance on this matter will be very dimly viewed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Federation of Small Business recently launched a portal to help with the new GDPR rules to help prepare smaller businesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The European Commission has released advisories to help smaller businsess prepare for the new regulations which aim to protect basic identity information, web data, health and genetic data, biometric data, racial or ethnic data, political opinion and sexual orientation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tamzin Evershed, head of legal at Veritas Technologies, said while many businesses are aware of the regulations, they do not know the consequences of non-compliance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Evershed said: &quot;One of the key challenges that many companies are facing is the complexities around effectively managing their data regardless of where it sits in their organisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Companies need to have complete visibility into data, including what information is stored, how it is used, who owns it and who accesses it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The current fine for business private data breach is around &pound;500,000. From May the new regulations increase the fine to an astronomical &pound;23.6 million or 4 percent of the business's total worldwide annual turnover, whichever is higher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In order to help small business, their trade body the Federation of Small Businesses have provided a blog post that explains the potential pitfalls of GDPR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition the FSB has set up a helpline with the Information Commissioners Office for any small businesses that have concerns.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook has moved more than 1.5 billion users out of reach of European privacy law, despite a promise from Mark Zuckerberg to apply the &quot;spirit&quot; of the legislation globally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a tweak to its terms and conditions, Facebook is shifting the responsibility for all users outside the US, Canada and the EU from its international HQ in Ireland to its main offices in California. It means that those users will now be on a site governed by US law rather than Irish law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The move is due to come into effect shortly before General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) comes into force in Europe on 25 May. Facebook is liable under GDPR for fines of up to 4% of its global turnover - around $1.6bn - if it breaks the new data protection rules. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shift highlights the cautious phrasing Facebook has applied to its promises around GDPR. Earlier this month, when asked whether his company would promise GDPR protections to its users worldwide, Zuckerberg demurred. &quot;We're still nailing down details on this, but it should directionally be, in spirit, the whole thing,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A week later, during his hearings in front of the US Congress, Zuckerberg was again asked if he would promise that GDPR's protections would apply to all Facebook users. His answer was affirmative - but only referred to GDPR &quot;controls&quot;, rather than &quot;protections&quot;. Worldwide, Facebook has rolled out a suite of tools to let users exercise their rights under GDPR, such as downloading and deleting data, and the company's new consent-gathering controls are similarly universal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook told Reuters &quot;we apply the same privacy protections everywhere, regardless of whether your agreement is with Facebook Inc or Facebook Ireland&quot;. It said the change was only carried out &quot;because EU law requires specific language&quot; in mandated privacy notices, which US law does not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement to the Guardian, it added: &quot;We have been clear that we are offering everyone who uses Facebook the same privacy protections, controls and settings, no matter where they live. These updates do not change that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Privacy researcher Lukasz Olejnik disagreed, noting that the change carried large ramifications for the affected users. &quot;Moving around one and a half billion users into other jurisdictions is not a simple copy-and-paste exercise,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a major and unprecedented change in the data privacy landscape. The change will amount to the reduction of privacy guarantees and the rights of users, with a number of ramifications, notably for for consent requirements. Users will clearly lose some existing rights, as US standards are lower than those in Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Data protection authorities from the countries of the affected users, such as New Zealand and Australia, may want to reassess this situation and analyse the situation. Even if their data privacy regulators are less rapid than those in Europe, this event is giving them a chance to act. Although it is unclear how active they will choose to be, the global privacy regulation landscape is changing, with countries in the world refining their approach. Europe is clearly on the forefront of this competition, but we should expect other countries to eventually catch up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook also said the change did not carry tax implications. That means users will exist in a state of legal superposition: for tax purposes, Facebook will continue to book their revenue through Facebook's Irish office, but for privacy protections, they will deal with the company's headquarters in California. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company follows other US multinationals in the switch. LinkedIn, for instance, is to move its own non-EU users to its US branch on 8 May. &quot;We've simply streamlined the contract location to ensure all members understand the LinkedIn entity responsible for their personal data,&quot; it told Reuters.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the political theatre of Mark Zuckerberg's congressional interrogations last week, Facebook's business model isn't at any real risk from regulators in the US. In Europe, however, the looming General Data Protection Regulation will give people better privacy protections and force companies including Facebook to make sweeping changes to the way they collect data and consent from users - with huge fines for those who don't comply.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's changing the balance of power from the giant digital marketing companies to focus on the needs of individuals and democratic society,&quot; said Jeffrey Chester, founder of the Center for Digital Democracy. &quot;That's an incredible breakthrough.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's a simple guide to the new rules.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   What is GDPR?                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Facebook refuses to promise GDPR-style privacy protection for US users</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a regulation that requires companies to protect the personal data and privacy of residents of EU countries. It replaces an outdated data protection directive from 1995 and restricts the way businesses collect, store and export people's personal data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Consumers have been abused,&quot; said David Carroll, an associate professor at Parsons School of Design in New York. &quot;Marketers have succeeded in making people feel powerless and resigned to getting the short end of the bargain. GDPR gives consumers the chance to renegotiate that very unfair deal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   Does it only affect European companies?                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No. It applies to all companies that process the personal data of people residing in the European Union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   What counts as personal data?                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Any information related to a person that can be used to identify them, including their name, photo, email address, IP address, bank details, posts on a social networking site, medical information, biometric data and sexual orientation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   What new rights do people get?                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under GDPR, people get expanded rights to obtain the data that a company has collected about them for free through a &quot;data subject request&quot;. People will also have the &quot;right to be forgotten&quot;, which means companies must delete someone's data if they withdraw their consent for it to be held. Companies will only be able to collect data if there's a specific business purpose for it, rather than collecting extra information at the point of sign-up just in case. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It makes companies become much more thoughtful and rigorous about the data they collect and what they use it for,&quot; Carroll said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What makes this a potential game changer is the amount of power it places into the hands of the public</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Attorney Jason Straight    </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Companies will have to replace long terms and conditions filled with legalese with simple-to-digest consent requests. It must be as easy to withdraw consent as to give it. Finally, if a company has a data breach, it must inform users within 72 hours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What makes this a potential game changer is the amount of power it places into the hands of the public,&quot; said attorney Jason Straight, who is chief privacy officer at legal services company UnitedLex.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   What about people outside of Europe?                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although it only applies to people located in the EU, the new rules will probably put pressure on companies to offer further protections for the rest of their users. Facebook, for example, has pledged to offer GDPR privacy controls globally. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This will be good for everyone,&quot; said Kris Lahiri, co-founder at the cloud-sharing company Egnyte, pointing out that global customers will demand the same rights as their European counterparts. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   Which companies have the most work to do?                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The big data-hungry technology platforms like Amazon, Google and Facebook and advertising technology companies such as Criteo, whose technology powers those ads featuring products you've browsed online that follow you around the internet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   What is Facebook doing to comply?                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Facebook to start asking permission for facial recognition in GDPR push</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having said it would follow GDPR &quot;in spirit&quot;, Facebook's actions tell a different story. On Wednesday Reuters reported that the company would change its terms of service so that its 1.5 billion non-European users would no longer be covered by the privacy law. Until now, all users outside of the US and Canada have been governed by terms of service agreed with the company's international headquarters in Ireland. Since any user data processed in Ireland will soon fall under GDPR, Facebook is changing the agreement so users in Africa, Asia, Australia and Latin America are governed by more lenient US privacy laws. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Where it needs to comply with GDPR, Facebook seems to have focused its efforts on getting user consent for its data collection practices ( including facial biometric data ) rather than reducing the data it collects. It has developed a sequence of consent requests that explicitly outline how each type of data will be used. However, as TechCrunch highlighted, the company has designed these requests in a way that makes it harder to opt out than opt in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   What about startups who don't have the same resources?                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Complying with GDPR may be a little onerous for companies that don't have the engineering resources of Facebook or Google. According to a PwC survey, 68% of US companies expect to spend between $1m and $10m to comply with GDPR. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And there's another way they'll get stung: GDPR consultants charging enormous fees for patchy advice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   What are the penalties for companies that don't comply?                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Companies can be fined up to 4% of annual global revenue, but it will come down to how regulators in individual countries choose to enforce the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   When does it come into effect?                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The twenty-fifth of May 2018. That's too early for some: &quot;There's a panic mode setting in as everyone is getting closer to this deadline,&quot; said Lahiri.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook is changing its business so that its users will not be covered by new privacy protections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new GDPRprotections, which will roll out next month, would apply to some 1.9 billion Facebook users if they went into effect now. But the site is moving its businesses around to ensure that the real number will be far smaller.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook users who are not in the US or Canada are currently held under terms of service run by its international headquarters, which are in Ireland. That means that the those users should also be protected by the GDPR rules, too - since they apply to anyone whose data is being collected by a European company, even if they are not in Europe themselves.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But next month Facebook will argue that only its European users will be covered by the new protections, which force Facebook to give people more power over their own data. The 1.5 million users in Africa, Asia, Australia and Latin America won't benefit from the new protections, they will say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The previously unreported move, whichFacebookconfirmed to Reuters on Tuesday, shows the world's largest online social network is keen to reduce its exposure to GDPR, which allows European regulators to fine companies for collecting or using personal data without users' consent.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That removes a huge potential liability forFacebook, as the new EU law allows for fines of up to 4 percent of global annual revenue for infractions, which inFacebook's case could mean billions of dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The change comes asFacebookis under scrutiny from regulators and lawmakers around the world since disclosing last month that the personal information of millions of users wrongly ended up in the hands of political consultancy Cambridge Analytica, setting off wider concerns about how it handles user data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The change affects more than 70 percent ofFacebook's 2 billion-plus members. As of December,Facebookhad 239 million users in the United States and Canada, 370 million in Europe and 1.52 billion users elsewhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook, like many other U.S. technology companies, established an Irish subsidiary in 2008 and took advantage of the country's low corporate tax rates, routing through it revenue from some advertisers outside North America. The unit is subject to regulations applied by the 28-nation European Union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebooksaid the latest change does not have tax implications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement given to Reuters,Facebookplayed down the importance of the terms of service change, saying it plans to make the privacy controls and settings that Europe will get under GDPR available to the rest of the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We apply the same privacy protections everywhere, regardless of whether your agreement is withFacebookInc orFacebookIreland,&quot; the company said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier this month,FacebookChief Executive Mark Zuckerberg told Reuters in an interview that his company would apply the EU law globally &quot;in spirit,&quot; but stopped short of committing to it as the standard for the social network across the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In practice, the change means the 1.5 billion affected users will not be able to file complaints with Ireland's Data Protection Commissioner or in Irish courts. Instead they will be governed by more lenient U.S. privacy laws, said Michael Veale, a technology policy researcher at University College London.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebookwill have more leeway in how it handles data about those users, Veale said. Certain types of data such as browsing history, for instance, are considered personal data under EU law but are not as protected in the United States, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company said its rationale for the change was related to the European Union's mandated privacy notices, &quot;because EU law requires specific language.&quot; For example, the company said, the new EU law requires specific legal terminology about the legal basis for processing data which does not exist in U.S. law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ireland was unaware of the change. One Irish official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he did not know of any plans byFacebookto transfer responsibilities wholesale to the United States or to decreaseFacebook's presence in Ireland, where the social network is seeking to recruit more than 100 new staff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebookreleased a revised terms of service in draft form two weeks ago, and they are scheduled to take effect next month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other multinational companies are also planning changes. LinkedIn, a unit of Microsoft Corp, tells users in its existing terms of service that if they are outside the United States, they have a contract with LinkedIn Ireland. New terms that take effect May 8 move non-Europeans to contracts with U.S.-based LinkedIn Corp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LinkedIn said in a statement on Wednesday that all users are entitled to the same privacy protections. &quot;We've simply streamlined the contract location to ensure all members understand the LinkedIn entity responsible for their personal data,&quot; the company said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook has finally responded to suggestions it could be forced to stop tracking people for advertising purposes. The company won't, it said. Instead, it will ask all of its users to explicitly opt in to having themselves tracked if they want to keep using Facebook.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some had suggested that the site could have to make major changes once a new European Union privacy law comes into effect. Many parts of those new regulations seem in direct conflict with Facebook's business, including new rules about what information can be harvested about users. The company said that it will not have to let people opt out of targeted marketing, as some had hoped. Instead, they will just have to opt in explicitly if they want to continue on the site, a decision made so that Facebook can keep its business model intact.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The EU law known as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which takes effect next month, promises the biggest shakeup in online privacy since the birth of the internet. Companies face fines if they collect or use personal information without permission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook deputy chief privacy officer Rob Sherman said the social network would begin seeking Europeans' permission this week for a variety of ways Facebook uses their data, but he said that opting out of targeted marketing altogether would not be possible. &quot;Facebook is an advertising-supported service,&quot; Sherman said in a briefing with reporters at Facebook's headquarters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook users will be able to limit the kinds of data that advertisers use to target their pitches, he added, but &quot;all ads on Facebook are targeted to some extent, and that's true for offline advertising, as well&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook, the world's largest social media network, will use what are known as &quot;permission screens&quot; - pages filled with text that require pressing a button to advance - to notify and obtain approval. The screens will show up on the Facebook website and smartphone app in Europe this week and globally in the coming months, Sherman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The screens will not give Facebook users the option to hit &quot;decline.&quot; Instead, they will guide users to either &quot;accept and continue&quot; or &quot;manage data setting,&quot; according to copies the company showed reporters on Tuesday. &quot;People can choose to not be on Facebook if they want,&quot; Sherman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regulators, investors and privacy advocates are closely watching how Facebook plans to comply with the EU law, not only because Facebook has been embroiled in a privacy scandal but also because other companies may follow its lead in trying to limit the impact of opt-outs. Last month, Facebook disclosed that the personal information of millions of users, mostly in the United States, had wrongly ended up in the hands of political consultancy Cambridge Analytica, leading to US congressional hearings and worldwide scrutiny of Facebook's commitment to privacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook chief financial officer David Wehner warned in February the company could see a drop-off in usage due to the GDPR.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook has finally responded to suggestions it could be forced to stop tracking people for advertising purposes. The company won't, it said. Instead, it will ask all of its users to explicitly opt in to having themselves tracked if they want to keep using Facebook.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some had suggested that the site could have to make major changes once a new European Union privacy law comes into effect. Many parts of those new regulations seem in direct conflict with Facebook's business, including new rules about what information can be harvested about users. The company said that it will not have to let people opt out of targeted marketing, as some had hoped. Instead, they will just have to opt in explicitly if they want to continue on the site, a decision made so that Facebook can keep its business model intact.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The EU law known as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which takes effect next month, promises the biggest shakeup in online privacy since the birth of the internet. Companies face fines if they collect or use personal information without permission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook deputy chief privacy officer Rob Sherman said the social network would begin seeking Europeans' permission this week for a variety of ways Facebook uses their data, but he said that opting out of targeted marketing altogether would not be possible. &quot;Facebook is an advertising-supported service,&quot; Sherman said in a briefing with reporters at Facebook's headquarters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook users will be able to limit the kinds of data that advertisers use to target their pitches, he added, but &quot;all ads on Facebook are targeted to some extent, and that's true for offline advertising, as well&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook, the world's largest social media network, will use what are known as &quot;permission screens&quot; - pages filled with text that require pressing a button to advance - to notify and obtain approval. The screens will show up on the Facebook website and smartphone app in Europe this week and globally in the coming months, Sherman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The screens will not give Facebook users the option to hit &quot;decline.&quot; Instead, they will guide users to either &quot;accept and continue&quot; or &quot;manage data setting,&quot; according to copies the company showed reporters on Tuesday. &quot;People can choose to not be on Facebook if they want,&quot; Sherman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regulators, investors and privacy advocates are closely watching how Facebook plans to comply with the EU law, not only because Facebook has been embroiled in a privacy scandal but also because other companies may follow its lead in trying to limit the impact of opt-outs. Last month, Facebook disclosed that the personal information of millions of users, mostly in the United States, had wrongly ended up in the hands of political consultancy Cambridge Analytica, leading to US congressional hearings and worldwide scrutiny of Facebook's commitment to privacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook chief financial officer David Wehner warned in February the company could see a drop-off in usage due to the GDPR.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New terms of service at Facebook are designed to ensure the Menlo Park, California, firm complies with the forthcoming EU rules, with European residents seeing the measures first.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook is hoping to exclude 1.5 billion of its worldwide users from the new GDPR laws, arguing that only EU citizens should fall under its purview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Almost 1.9 billion non-EU international users, outside of the US and Canada, would be protected by the stricter law under current rules.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Members in Africa, Asia, Australia and Latin America would be excluded from the GDPR's protections if the move goes ahead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the new policy, Facebook users will be asked to review and make choices about ads they receive, including whether they want Facebook to use data from third parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook will begin to ask users if they want to opt in or out of its facial recognition feature, which is making a return under GDPR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They will also be asked to review and choose what to share about sensitive personal data. This will include their political and religious beliefs, as well as relationship status information on their profiles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook is also taking steps to comply with rules that limit advertising and public viewing of data for teens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This will mean no use of facial recognition for anyone under age 18 and limitations on who can see certain information teens have shared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To comply with GDPR, Facebook will also limit what it shows to users between the ages of 13 and 15 unless they get permission from a parent.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook is planning to exclude 1.5 billion of its worldwide users from new European laws protecting data privacy, it has emerged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">European Union (EU) regulations coming into force next month will crack down on how companies like Facebook use and sell the data they collect on users.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Almost 1.9 billion non-EU international users, outside of the US and Canada, would&nbsp;be protected by the stricter law under current rules.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a change in the site's terms of service - which comes&nbsp;as Facebook faces increasing scrutiny from lawmakers - seeks to ensure that the number will be much smaller.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The news comes as Facebook continues to battle a scandal in which user's profiles wrongly ended up in the hands of British firm Cambridge Analytica.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This has sparked wider concerns about how the world's most popular social network handles the information it stores about its more than two billion users.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scroll down for video </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of Facebook's global members, whether they know it or not, are currently governed by terms of service agreed with the company's international headquarters in Dublin.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook is planning to make that the case that only Europeans fall under the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which takes effect on May 25, according to Reuters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Menlo Park, California, firm released a revised terms of service in draft form two weeks ago, which is scheduled to take effect next month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Members in Africa, Asia, Australia and Latin America would be excluded from the GDPR's protections if the move goes ahead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The previously unreported strategy, which has since been confirmed by Facebook , shows the world's largest online social media site is keen to reduce its exposure to GDPR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It allows European regulators to fine companies for collecting or using personal data without users' consent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That removes a huge potential liability for Facebook, as the new EU law allows for fines of up to four per cent of global annual revenue for infractions, which in Facebook's case could cost billions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The change affects more than 70 per cent of members.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As of December, Facebook had 239 million users in the United States and Canada, 370 million in Europe and 1.52 billion users elsewhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook, like many other US technology companies, established an Irish subsidiary in 2008 and took advantage of the country's low corporate tax rates, routing through it revenue from some advertisers outside North America.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The unit is subject to regulations applied by the 28-nation European Union. Facebook said the latest change does not have tax implications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement given to Reuters, Facebook played down the importance of the terms of service change, saying it plans to make the privacy controls and settings that Europe will get under GDPR available to the rest of the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We apply the same privacy protections everywhere, regardless of whether your agreement is with Facebook Inc or Facebook Ireland,' the company said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier this month, Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg told the news agency in an interview that his company would apply the EU law globally 'in spirit,' but stopped short of committing to it as the standard for the social network across the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In practice, the change means the 1.5 billion affected users will not be able to file complaints with Ireland's Data Protection Commissioner or in Irish courts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead they will be governed by more lenient US privacy laws, said Michael Veale, a technology policy researcher at University College London.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook will have more leeway in how it handles data about those users, Dr Veale said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Certain types of data such as browsing history, for instance, are considered personal data under EU law but are not as protected in the United States, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company said its rationale for the change was related to the European Union's mandated privacy notices, 'because EU law requires specific language.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, the company said, the new EU law requires specific terminology about the legal basis for processing data which does not exist in U.S. law.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ireland's government has said it is unaware of the change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One Irish official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he did not know of any plans by Facebook to transfer responsibilities wholesale to the United States or to decrease Facebook's presence in Ireland, where the social network is seeking to recruit more than 100 new staff.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other multinational companies are also planning changes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LinkedIn, a unit of Microsoft, tells users in its existing terms of service that if they are outside the United States, they have a contract with LinkedIn Ireland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New terms that take effect May 8 move non-Europeans to contracts with U.S.-based LinkedIn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LinkedIn said in a statement on Wednesday that all users are entitled to the same privacy protections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We've simply streamlined the contract location to ensure all members understand the LinkedIn entity responsible for their personal data,' the company said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The revelations comes as news emerged about a&nbsp;controversial Facebook AI tool that could soon be making a return to Europe and Canada.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facial recognition, launched in 2010, suggests names for people it identifies in photos uploaded by users.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was suspended for users in Europe in 2012 over privacy concerns, but still lives on in the US and other regions worldwide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now the firm says it will make a comeback,&nbsp;using the new European data protection regulations as a chance to collect more information if users opt in.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook will begin to ask users if they want to opt in or out of the facial recognition feature under GDPR this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the new policy, Facebook users will also be asked to review and make choices about ads they receive, including whether they want Facebook to use data from third parties.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They will also be asked to review and choose what to share about the political, religious, and relationship information on their profiles.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These are designed to ensure the firm complies with the forthcoming EU rules, with European residents seeing the measures first.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Everyone - no matter where they live - will be asked to review important information about how Facebook uses data and make choices about their privacy on Facebook,' chief privacy officer Erin Egan and deputy general counsel Ashlie Beringer said in a written statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement also said users will be told that facial recognition is optional, but that it could offer some benefit, such as being notified when someone is using an unauthorised picture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We not only want to comply with the law, but also go beyond our obligations to build new and improved privacy experiences for everyone on Facebook,' Ms Egan and Ms Beringer wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GPDR aims to strengthen and unify data protection for all individuals within the European Union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The law will mark the biggest overhaul of personal data privacy rules since the birth of the internet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under GDPR, companies will be required to report data breaches within 72 hours, as well as to allow customers to export their data and delete it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The laws will be welcome news to anyone affected by the Cambridge Analytica scandal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg faced ten hours of questioning in two congressional panels last week, following revelations that personal data was harvested by the British consultancy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zuckerberg testified that Facebook intends to offer the same privacy protections embodied in GDPR for its worldwide users, but that there could be some differences in format.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Egan and Ms Beringer said Facebook users in the EU will start seeing the requests this week so they can make choices before May 25.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'As part of our phased approach, people in the rest of the world will be asked to make their choices on a slightly later schedule,' they said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They added that Facebook would take steps to comply with the EU rules that limit advertising and public viewing of data for teens.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This will mean no use of facial recognition for anyone under age 18 and limitations on who can see certain information teens have shared.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To comply with GDPR, Facebook will also limit what it shows to users between the ages of 13 and 15 unless they get permission from a parent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday it emerged a US federal judge has ruled Facebook will face a class action law suit in the wake of its privacy scandal.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Allegations of privacy violations emerged when it was revealed the app used a photo-scanning tool on users' images without their explicit consent.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under Illinois state law, the company could be fined $1,000 to $5,000 (&pound;700 to &pound;3,500) each time a person's image was used without consent.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is believed that the function runs afoul of Illinois state law on protecting biometric privacy.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judge James Donato ruled the claims by Illinois residents Nimesh Patel, Adam Pezen, and Carlo Licata were 'sufficiently cohesive to allow for a fair and efficient resolution on a class basis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Consequently, the case will proceed with a class consisting of Facebook users located in Illinois for whom Facebook created and stored a face template after June 7, 2011,' he said, according to the ruling.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook rolled out its 'tag suggestions' feature in June 2011.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The feature is not currently available to users in most countries, including the UK - and can be turned off in settings for US users.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook believe that the lawsuit should be pursued by individual as the total amount of damages could 'amount to billions of dollars,' U.S. District Judge James Donato wrote in the ruling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The judge has ruled that the Illinois law is clear: Facebook has collected a 'wealth of data on its users, including self-reported residency and IP addresses,' reports Bloomberg.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook has acknowledged that it can identify which users who live in Illinois have face templates, he wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A face template can be generated from ten or more photos and is used to generate a profile on Facebook's database.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Although many individuals may not have had enough tagged photos to generate a face template in Facebook's database, in January 2011 [when Facebook implemented tag suggestions for all users] the average user was tagged in 53 photos, far more than the 10 needed to generate a face template,' according to a December court filing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Facebook spokeswoman said the company was reviewing the decision, adding: 'We continue to believe the case has no merit and will defend ourselves vigorously.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook also contends it has been very open about the tool since its inception.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As well as allowing users to turn the feature off, the Zuckerberg-owned app lets users prevent themselves from being suggested in photo tags.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also emerged this week that secret surveillance software created by a former Israeli intelligence officer is harvesting Facebook photos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The firm behind it,&nbsp;Face-Int, is taking profile images from the social network, YouTube and other sites to build a huge facial recognition database.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Its creators say the software could lead to the identification of terror suspects, captured in promotional and other material posted online.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">European Union (EU) regulations coming into force next month will crack down on how companies like Facebook use and sell the data they collect on users.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Almost 1.9 billion non-EU international users, outside of the US and Canada, would&nbsp;be protected by the stricter law under current rules.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a change in the site's terms of service - which comes&nbsp;as Facebook faces increasing scrutiny from lawmakers - seeks to ensure that the number will be much smaller.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The news comes as Facebook continues to battle a scandal in which user's profiles wrongly ended up in the hands of British firm Cambridge Analytica.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This has sparked wider concerns about how the world's most popular social network handles the information it stores about its more than two billion users.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scroll down for video </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of Facebook's global members, whether they know it or not, are currently governed by terms of service agreed with the company's international headquarters in Dublin.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook is planning to make it the case that only Europeans fall under the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which takes effect on May 25, according to Reuters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Menlo Park, California, firm released a revised terms of service in draft form two weeks ago, which is scheduled to take effect next month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Members in Africa, Asia, Australia and Latin America would be excluded from the GDPR's protections if the move goes ahead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The previously unreported strategy, which has since been confirmed by Facebook , shows the world's largest online social media site is keen to reduce its exposure to GDPR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It allows European regulators to fine companies for collecting or using personal data without users' consent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That removes a huge potential liability for Facebook, as the new EU law allows for fines of up to four per cent of global annual revenue for infractions, which in Facebook's case could cost billions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The change affects more than 70 per cent of members.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As of December, Facebook had 239 million users in the United States and Canada, 370 million in Europe and 1.52 billion users elsewhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook, like many other US technology companies, established an Irish subsidiary in 2008 and took advantage of the country's low corporate tax rates, routing through it revenue from some advertisers outside North America.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The unit is subject to regulations applied by the 28-nation European Union. Facebook said the latest change does not have tax implications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement given to Reuters, Facebook played down the importance of the terms of service change, saying it plans to make the privacy controls and settings that Europe will get under GDPR available to the rest of the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We apply the same privacy protections everywhere, regardless of whether your agreement is with Facebook Inc or Facebook Ireland,' the company said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier this month, Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg told the news agency in an interview that his company would apply the EU law globally 'in spirit,' but stopped short of committing to it as the standard for the social network across the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In practice, the change means the 1.5 billion affected users will not be able to file complaints with Ireland's Data Protection Commissioner or in Irish courts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead they will be governed by more lenient US privacy laws, said Michael Veale, a technology policy researcher at University College London.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook will have more leeway in how it handles data about those users, Dr Veale said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Certain types of data such as browsing history, for instance, are considered personal data under EU law but are not as protected in the United States, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company said its rationale for the change was related to the European Union's mandated privacy notices, 'because EU law requires specific language.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, the company said, the new EU law requires specific terminology about the legal basis for processing data which does not exist in U.S. law.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ireland's government has said it is unaware of the change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One Irish official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he did not know of any plans by Facebook to transfer responsibilities wholesale to the United States or to decrease Facebook's presence in Ireland, where the social network is seeking to recruit more than 100 new staff.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other multinational companies are also planning changes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LinkedIn, a unit of Microsoft, tells users in its existing terms of service that if they are outside the United States, they have a contract with LinkedIn Ireland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New terms that take effect May 8 move non-Europeans to contracts with U.S.-based LinkedIn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LinkedIn said in a statement on Wednesday that all users are entitled to the same privacy protections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We've simply streamlined the contract location to ensure all members understand the LinkedIn entity responsible for their personal data,' the company said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The revelations comes as news emerged about a&nbsp;controversial Facebook AI tool that could soon be making a return to Europe and Canada.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facial recognition, launched in 2010, suggests names for people it identifies in photos uploaded by users.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was suspended for users in Europe in 2012 over privacy concerns, but still lives on in the US and other regions worldwide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now the firm says it will make a comeback,&nbsp;using the new European data protection regulations as a chance to collect more information if users opt in.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook will begin to ask users if they want to opt in or out of the facial recognition feature under GDPR this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the new policy, Facebook users will also be asked to review and make choices about ads they receive, including whether they want Facebook to use data from third parties.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They will also be asked to review and choose what to share about the political, religious, and relationship information on their profiles.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These are designed to ensure the firm complies with the forthcoming EU rules, with European residents seeing the measures first.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Everyone - no matter where they live - will be asked to review important information about how Facebook uses data and make choices about their privacy on Facebook,' chief privacy officer Erin Egan and deputy general counsel Ashlie Beringer said in a written statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement also said users will be told that facial recognition is optional, but that it could offer some benefit, such as being notified when someone is using an unauthorised picture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We not only want to comply with the law, but also go beyond our obligations to build new and improved privacy experiences for everyone on Facebook,' Ms Egan and Ms Beringer wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GPDR aims to strengthen and unify data protection for all individuals within the European Union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The law will mark the biggest overhaul of personal data privacy rules since the birth of the internet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under GDPR, companies will be required to report data breaches within 72 hours, as well as to allow customers to export their data and delete it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The laws will be welcome news to anyone affected by the Cambridge Analytica scandal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg faced ten hours of questioning in two congressional panels last week, following revelations that personal data was harvested by the British consultancy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zuckerberg testified that Facebook intends to offer the same privacy protections embodied in GDPR for its worldwide users, but that there could be some differences in format.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Egan and Ms Beringer said Facebook users in the EU will start seeing the requests this week so they can make choices before May 25.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'As part of our phased approach, people in the rest of the world will be asked to make their choices on a slightly later schedule,' they said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They added that Facebook would take steps to comply with the EU rules that limit advertising and public viewing of data for teens.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This will mean no use of facial recognition for anyone under age 18 and limitations on who can see certain information teens have shared.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To comply with GDPR, Facebook will also limit what it shows to users between the ages of 13 and 15 unless they get permission from a parent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday it emerged a US federal judge has ruled Facebook will face a class action law suit in the wake of its privacy scandal.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Allegations of privacy violations emerged when it was revealed the app used a photo-scanning tool on users' images without their explicit consent.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under Illinois state law, the company could be fined $1,000 to $5,000 (&pound;700 to &pound;3,500) each time a person's image was used without consent.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is believed that the function runs afoul of Illinois state law on protecting biometric privacy.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judge James Donato ruled the claims by Illinois residents Nimesh Patel, Adam Pezen, and Carlo Licata were 'sufficiently cohesive to allow for a fair and efficient resolution on a class basis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Consequently, the case will proceed with a class consisting of Facebook users located in Illinois for whom Facebook created and stored a face template after June 7, 2011,' he said, according to the ruling.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook rolled out its 'tag suggestions' feature in June 2011.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The feature is not currently available to users in most countries, including the UK - and can be turned off in settings for US users.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook believe that the lawsuit should be pursued by individual as the total amount of damages could 'amount to billions of dollars,' U.S. District Judge James Donato wrote in the ruling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The judge has ruled that the Illinois law is clear: Facebook has collected a 'wealth of data on its users, including self-reported residency and IP addresses,' reports Bloomberg.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook has acknowledged that it can identify which users who live in Illinois have face templates, he wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A face template can be generated from ten or more photos and is used to generate a profile on Facebook's database.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Although many individuals may not have had enough tagged photos to generate a face template in Facebook's database, in January 2011 [when Facebook implemented tag suggestions for all users] the average user was tagged in 53 photos, far more than the 10 needed to generate a face template,' according to a December court filing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Facebook spokeswoman said the company was reviewing the decision, adding: 'We continue to believe the case has no merit and will defend ourselves vigorously.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook also contends it has been very open about the tool since its inception.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As well as allowing users to turn the feature off, the Zuckerberg-owned app lets users prevent themselves from being suggested in photo tags.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also emerged this week that secret surveillance software created by a former Israeli intelligence officer is harvesting Facebook photos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The firm behind it,&nbsp;Face-Int, is taking profile images from the social network, YouTube and other sites to build a huge facial recognition database.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Its creators say the software could lead to the identification of terror suspects, captured in promotional and other material posted online.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The require companies to seek explicit opt-in consent before collecting data, and promptly disclose breaches to users.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Currently, the law would require Facebook to apply these changes to 1.9 billion users.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a draft change in Facebook's terms of service - which comes&nbsp;as the firm faces increasing scrutiny from lawmakers - would make that number much smaller.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scroll down for video </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The changes to the terms of service were uncovered by a Reuters investigation.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook users outside the US and Canada are currently subject to any regulations&nbsp;with the company's international headquarters in Dublin.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the company is planning to try and exempt all of those users outside the EU including members in Africa, Asia, Australia and Latin America, Reuters said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, it has yet to reveal how it will do this.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Menlo Park, California, firm released a revised terms of service in draft form two weeks ago, which is scheduled to take effect next month.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Exempting users outside of the EU that would normally have protection removes a huge potential liability for Facebook, as the new EU&nbsp;GDPR law allows for fines of up to four per cent of global annual revenue for infractions, which in Facebook's case could cost billions.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The current changes to the terms of service appear to be a U-turn for the company.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier this month, following the shocking revelation that the firm shared the data of up to 87 million users with the political consultancy firm Cambridge Analytica, Mark Zuckerberg said European-style privacy protection will be given to all users.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We're going to make all the same controls and settings available everywhere, not just in Europe, he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The European regulations, coming into force on May 25, aim to crack down on how companies like Facebook use and sell the data they collect on users.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The require companies to seek explicit opt-in consent before collecting data, and promptly disclose breaches to users.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Currently, the law would require Facebook to apply these changes to 1.9 billion users.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a draft change in Facebook's terms of service - which comes&nbsp;as the firm faces increasing scrutiny from lawmakers - would make that number much smaller.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scroll down for video </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The changes to the terms of service were uncovered by a Reuters investigation.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook users outside the US and Canada are currently subject to any regulations&nbsp;with the company's international headquarters in Dublin.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the company is planning to try and exempt all of those users outside the EU including members in Africa, Asia, Australia and Latin America, Reuters said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In practice, the change means the 1.5 billion affected users will not be able to file complaints with Ireland's Data Protection Commissioner or in Irish courts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead they will be governed by more lenient US privacy laws, said Michael Veale, a technology policy researcher at University College London.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook will have more leeway in how it handles data about those users, Dr Veale said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Certain types of data such as browsing history, for instance, are considered personal data under EU law but are not as protected in the United States, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company said its rationale for the change was related to the European Union's mandated privacy notices, 'because EU law requires specific language.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, the company said, the new EU law requires specific terminology about the legal basis for processing data which does not exist in US law.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement given to Reuters, Facebook says it plans to make similar privacy controls and settings that Europe will get under GDPR available to the rest of the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, it has yet to reveal how it will do this.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Menlo Park, California, firm released a revised terms of service in draft form two weeks ago, which is scheduled to take effect next month.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Exempting users outside of the EU that would normally have protection removes a huge potential liability for Facebook, as the new EU&nbsp;GDPR law allows for fines of up to four per cent of global annual revenue for infractions, which in Facebook's case could cost billions.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The current changes to the terms of service appear to be a U-turn for the company.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier this month, following the shocking revelation that the firm shared the data of up to 87 million users with the political consultancy firm Cambridge Analytica, Mark Zuckerberg said European-style privacy protection will be given to all users.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We're going to make all the same controls and settings available everywhere, not just in Europe, he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other multinational companies are also planning changes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LinkedIn, a unit of Microsoft, tells users in its existing terms of service that if they are outside the United States, they have a contract with LinkedIn Ireland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New terms that take effect May 8 move non-Europeans to contracts with U.S.-based LinkedIn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LinkedIn said in a statement on Wednesday that all users are entitled to the same privacy protections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We've simply streamlined the contract location to ensure all members understand the LinkedIn entity responsible for their personal data,' the company said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The revelations comes as news emerged about a&nbsp;controversial Facebook AI tool that could soon be making a return to Europe and Canada.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facial recognition, launched in 2010, suggests names for people it identifies in photos uploaded by users.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was suspended for users in Europe in 2012 over privacy concerns, but still lives on in the US and other regions worldwide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now the firm says it will make a comeback,&nbsp;using the new European data protection regulations as a chance to collect more information if users opt in.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook will begin to ask users if they want to opt in or out of the facial recognition feature under GDPR this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the new policy, Facebook users will also be asked to review and make choices about ads they receive, including whether they want Facebook to use data from third parties.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They will also be asked to review and choose what to share about the political, religious, and relationship information on their profiles.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These are designed to ensure the firm complies with the forthcoming EU rules, with European residents seeing the measures first.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Everyone - no matter where they live - will be asked to review important information about how Facebook uses data and make choices about their privacy on Facebook,' chief privacy officer Erin Egan and deputy general counsel Ashlie Beringer said in a written statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement also said users will be told that facial recognition is optional, but that it could offer some benefit, such as being notified when someone is using an unauthorised picture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We not only want to comply with the law, but also go beyond our obligations to build new and improved privacy experiences for everyone on Facebook,' Ms Egan and Ms Beringer wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GPDR aims to strengthen and unify data protection for all individuals within the European Union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The law will mark the biggest overhaul of personal data privacy rules since the birth of the internet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under GDPR, companies will be required to report data breaches within 72 hours, as well as to allow customers to export their data and delete it.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook is taking measures to shield 1.5billion of its users from incoming European data protection law, greatly reducing their privacy rights.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From next month users in Africa, Asia, Australia and Latin America will no longer have the same privacy rights as Europeans, when it switches the location of where their accounts are hosted.&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The move appears to be an attempt to reduce its liability under the incoming General Data Protection Regulation, which restricts what companies can do with people's data. Facebook faces fines up to around $1.1bn (&pound;770m) if found to be in breach of the law, which comes into effect on May 25.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Services for all its users bar Americans and Canadians are stored in Ireland, its European headquarters, but its plans would keep all those not based in Europe from the scrutiny of European lawmakers, reducing the company's exposure to huge fines, Reuters reported.&nbsp;The change affects more than 70pc of Facebook's two billion-plus members. As of December, Facebook had 239m users in the US and Canada, 370m in Europe and 1.52bn elsewhere.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook told Reuters it plans to make the privacy controls and settings that Europe will get under GDPR available to the rest of the world. &quot;We apply the same privacy protections everywhere, regardless of whether your agreement is with Facebook Inc or Facebook Ireland,&quot; the company said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, continued fallout from the Cambridge Analytica data-sharing scandal continued with new research that claimed by logging into websites or apps using a Facebook account, millions may have been exposed to big data companies quietly mining their personal information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marketing companies embedded in websites that use the &quot;sign in with Facebook&quot; function, were able to collect names, email addresses and in some cases track people around the web, privacy engineer and Princeton PhD student Steven Englehardt has found.&nbsp; Mr Englehardt, along with researchers&nbsp;Gunes Acar, and Arvind Narayanan found seven third parties abusing websites' access to Facebook user data with one third party uses its own Facebook &quot;application&quot; to track users around the web.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These included OnAudience.com, Lytics and Tealium, which offer companies datasets to pad out their own customer information collection. If a company wants to know more about a customer, it can cross-examine its database to pad out any missing parts. OnAudience.com proudly states that it owns more than 9 billion profiles on its website.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook has started to seek explicit consent from users for targeted advertising, storage of sensitive information, and - for the first time in the EU - application of facial recognition technology as the European general data protection regulation (GDPR) is due to come into force in just over a month.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company is only required to seek the new permissions in the European Union, but it plans to roll them out to all Facebook users, no matter where they live. The move follows Mark Zuckerberg's stated goal to apply the spirit of GDPR worldwide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Facebook admits tracking users and non-users off-site</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Facebook users log in during the coming weeks, they will be asked to agree to the company's updated terms of service, and to make specific choices in a number of areas defined by the new law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a blogpost, Facebook executives Erin Egan and Ashlie Beringer said users would be asked to review information about targeted advertising, and to choose whether or not they want the social network to use data from partners to show them ads; to explicitly confirm whether they're happy to share &quot;political, religious, and relationship information&quot;, which is defined as specially protected data under EU law; and to agree to the use of facial recognition technology, which Facebook says will be used to detect which pictures users are in and help protect them against strangers using their photos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some users, however,say Facebook is attempting to railroad them in to giving consent under the new laws, rather than making it easy to make a meaningful choice. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If users want to decline the new permissions, they are not able to simply click &quot;no&quot;. Instead, all of the options are presented with a blue button reading &quot;accept and continue&quot; and a white button labelled &quot;manage data settings&quot;. The &quot;manage data settings&quot; button takes them to a second page where Facebook gives more information pushing them into accepting the change, and then a third page where they are able to opt out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Overall, it seems like Facebook is complying with the letter of GDPR law, but with questionable spirit,&quot; wrote TechCrunch's Josh Constine. &quot;The subtly pushy designs seem intended to steer people away from changing their defaults in ways that could hamper Facebook's mission and business.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facial recognition is a particular watershed for Facebook. The company withdrew an earlier facial recognition feature called tag suggestions from the EU and Canada in 2012 over concerns that it was not compatible with data protection laws in those jurisdictions. Now, however, the company believes it can roll out the features worldwide if it secures active consent from users before applying facial recognition technology to their photos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A California judge allowed a class-action lawsuit against Facebook on Monday over tag suggestions. Users in Illinois are suing the company, arguing that the feature violated state law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If there's one thing the recent fallout from the Cambridge Analytica scandal has taught us, it's that any goodwill we held towards tech companies using - and abusing - our data has run out.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On top of the battering Facebook's reputation has taken after it emerged that the personal data of millions of users had been harvested to target political advertisements, the company is now being sued by a group of users in Illinois who object to the social network's use of facial recognition technology.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First filed in 2015, the case has finally been given the go-ahead by a San Francisco judge, who has allowed the plaintiffs to launch a class action lawsuit on the behalf of all users in the state &quot;for whom Facebook created and stored a face template after 7 June 2011&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Face templates were introduced when Facebook brought in a feature called Tag Suggestions, which uses facial recognition to try to guess who is in a photo. While Facebook doesn't directly keep a database of users' faces, the complainants allege it &quot;collects and stores their biometric data without prior notice or consent in the violation of their privacy rights.&quot; Facebook denies all wrongdoing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act of 2008, Facebook could be fined between $1,000 and $5,000 each time a person's image is used without their consent. Consent, incidentally, is also the key factor in the Cambridge Analytica scandal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tide appears to be turning on murky data collection practices, which may be buried somewhere in the terms and conditions but which require users to opt out rather than opt in. Cambridge Analytica coupled with the forthcoming GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation, centred around giving individuals control of their personal data, not organisations) is triggering a complete shift in how companies such as Facebook and Google handle your information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While privacy advocates and a handful of tech experts have been banging the data protection and privacy drum for years, real change only ever comes when the tech giants feel pressured into making it - through fear of losing money, users and public face. Perhaps now they'll make it their business to make sure users are informed about what they're signing up to.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company won't, it said. Instead, it will ask all of its users to explicitly opt in to having themselves tracked if they want to keep using Facebook.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some had suggested that the site could have to make major changes once a new European Union privacy law comes into effect. Many parts of those new regulations seem in direct conflict with Facebook's business, including new rules about what information can be harvested about users.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company said that it will not have to let people opt out of targeted marketing, as some had hoped. Instead, they will just have to opt in explicitly if they want to continue on the site, a decision made so that Facebook can keep its business model intact.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The EU law known as GDPR, which takes effect next month, promises the biggest shakeup in online privacy since the birth of the internet. Companies face fines if they collect or use personal information without permission.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook admits it tracks users around the internet for ads</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook Deputy Chief Privacy Officer Rob Sherman said the social network would begin seeking Europeans' permission this week for a variety of ways Facebook uses their data, but he said that opting out of targeted marketing altogether would not be possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Facebook is an advertising-supported service,&quot; Sherman said in a briefing with reporters at Facebook's headquarters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook users will be able to limit the kinds of data that advertisers use to target their pitches, he added, but &quot;all ads on Facebook are targeted to some extent, and that's true for offline advertising, as well.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook, the world's largest social media network, will use what are known as &quot;permission screens&quot; - pages filled with text that require pressing a button to advance - to notify and obtain approval.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The screens will show up on the Facebook website and smartphone app in Europe this week and globally in the coming months, Sherman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The screens will not give Facebook users the option to hit &quot;decline.&quot; Instead, they will guide users to either &quot;accept and continue&quot; or &quot;manage data setting,&quot; according to copies the company showed reporters on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People can choose to not be on Facebook if they want,&quot; Sherman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regulators, investors and privacy advocates are closely watching how Facebook plans to comply with the EU law, not only because Facebook has been embroiled in a privacy scandal but also because other companies may follow its lead in trying to limit the impact of opt-outs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last month, Facebook disclosed that the personal information of millions of users, mostly in the United States, had wrongly ended up in the hands of political consultancy Cambridge Analytica, leading to U.S. congressional hearings and worldwide scrutiny of Facebook's commitment to privacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook Chief Financial Officer David Wehner warned in February the company could see a drop-off in usage due to the EU law, known as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook has finally responded to suggestions it could be forced to stop tracking people for advertising purposes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company won't, it said. Instead, it will ask all of its users to explicitly opt in to having themselves tracked if they want to keep using Facebook.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some had suggested that the site could have to make major changes once a new European Union privacy law comes into effect. Many parts of those new regulations seem in direct conflict with Facebook's business, including new rules about what information can be harvested about users.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company said that it will not have to let people opt out of targeted marketing, as some had hoped. Instead, they will just have to opt in explicitly if they want to continue on the site, a decision made so that Facebook can keep its business model intact.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The EU law known as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which takes effect next month, promises the biggest shakeup in online privacy since the birth of the internet. Companies face fines if they collect or use personal information without permission.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook admits it tracks users around the internet for ads</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook deputy chief privacy officer Rob Sherman said the social network would begin seeking Europeans' permission this week for a variety of ways Facebook uses their data, but he said that opting out of targeted marketing altogether would not be possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Facebook is an advertising-supported service,&quot; Sherman said in a briefing with reporters at Facebook's headquarters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook users will be able to limit the kinds of data that advertisers use to target their pitches, he added, but &quot;all ads on Facebook are targeted to some extent, and that's true for offline advertising, as well&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook, the world's largest social media network, will use what are known as &quot;permission screens&quot; - pages filled with text that require pressing a button to advance - to notify and obtain approval.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The screens will show up on the Facebook website and smartphone app in Europe this week and globally in the coming months, Sherman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The screens will not give Facebook users the option to hit &quot;decline.&quot; Instead, they will guide users to either &quot;accept and continue&quot; or &quot;manage data setting,&quot; according to copies the company showed reporters on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People can choose to not be on Facebook if they want,&quot; Sherman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regulators, investors and privacy advocates are closely watching how Facebook plans to comply with the EU law, not only because Facebook has been embroiled in a privacy scandal but also because other companies may follow its lead in trying to limit the impact of opt-outs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last month, Facebook disclosed that the personal information of millions of users, mostly in the United States, had wrongly ended up in the hands of political consultancy Cambridge Analytica, leading to UScongressional hearings and worldwide scrutiny of Facebook's commitment to privacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook chief financial officer David Wehner warned in February the company could see a drop-off in usage due to the GDPR.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
</LI><LI CLASS="c10"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"><NOBR>&bull;</NOBR></SPAN></P>
<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GDPR will ensure that tech firms like Google and Facebook follow stricter rules&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
</LI><LI CLASS="c10"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"><NOBR>&bull;</NOBR></SPAN></P>
<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The directive came into force in May 2016 after the EU agreed to the final text&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GDPR compliance deadline for European Union member states is fast approaching, with many tech companies updating their data protection for the 21st century in order to effectively replace the Data Protection Act 1998.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The General Data Protection Regulation has been formulated to ensure that organisations like&nbsp; Google and Facebook &nbsp;follow stricter rules and regulations amid concerns over how private data is collected and shared.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This concern was exacerbated after the 2016 US Election which led to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg having to sit down before Congress to discuss the Cambridge Analytica scandal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With over 87 million users estimated to have had their data mined through the 'This Is Your Digital Life' quiz, it has also emerged that private Facebook Messenger conversations may have also fallen into the hands of Cambridge Analytica. But what is GDPR?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     What is GDPR?                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The General Data Protection Regulation has been created over the course of four years in order to strengthen data protection in an era in which people are continuously giving social media websites permissions to use their personal information in exchange for 'free' services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GDPR will be replacing the Data Protection Act 1998, which itself was brought into law so that the 1995 EU Data Protection Directive could be implemented and give people more control over how organisations use data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The regulation also introduced penalties for those who do not comply with the new rules and in turn, suffer from data breaches. It also standardised all data laws across the European Union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A significant change in the new regulation is that if companies fail to provide adequate security to protect data, they could be fined heavily under GDPR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Why do we need GDPR?&nbsp;&nbsp;                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The advent of the Internet and the emergence of the cloud led to organisations being able to use personal user data for their own purposes, which caused problems when individuals wanted to know how their information was being used.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GDPR was planned because of the EU's need to align data protection law with the 21st century, a time where people use free services like&nbsp; Amazon, Google, Twitter and Facebook and offer their information openly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alongside this, the EU wanted to align data protection law across all member states so that companies are clear about what they need to comply with.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     When will the GDPR be implemented?                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GDPR will apply from&nbsp;May 25, 2018 in all EU member states automatically, without the need for each country having to draw up their own legislation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While businesses have until May 25 to ensure they have applied the new rules, the directive came into force on May 24, 2016 after the EU agreed to the final text.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Who does the GDPR apply to?                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GDPR will apply to those who decide how and why personal data is processed, the controllers, as well as those who actively process the data, otherwise known as the processors. This means that GDPR could apply to anyone working in a company, charity, government or IT firm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It will also apply to controllers and processors that are based outside the EU, but deal with data that belongs to EU residents. Controllers are responsible for ensuring that processors abide by the new law and process data lawfully, who themselves are required to maintain records of their activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the GDPR is put in place, data must be processed with consent and transparently, for a purpose and once it is no longer needed, data should be deleted. Alongside this, consent must be granted in an active fashion by the user, not passively with pre-ticked boxes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     What is personal data?                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the GDPR, the European Union has expanded the definition of 'personal data' to include other online identifiers such as IP addresses, mental health, cultural and economic information about an individual.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Individuals already have the right to access information that a company has obtained and to know how and why their data is being processed, as well as who will see it. Data can also be rectified, changed or deleted at any time by the person it belongs to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     How much are GDPR fines?                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When a data breach occurs, the people who are at risk of being affected must be told within 72 hours of the company being aware of it. Those who do not meet this deadline could face a penalty of two per cent of their annual worldwide revenue, or (EURO)10 million (&pound;8.7m), whichever is higher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then, the data protection authority should be contacted and in the UK, this means the Information Commissioner's Office, or the ICO. The authority should be given information about the nature of data breach, how many people have been affected, what the consequences could be and what measures have been actioned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If people's rights are ignored, the fine could reach up to (EURO)20 million (&pound;17m) or four per cent of your global annual turnover, whichever is higher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Does Brexit affect GDPR?                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With Article 50 being triggered in March 2017, the UK has two years in which to leave the European Union, but this means that the GDPR will be implemented before this time.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In August 2017, the UK government put forward a new Data Protection Bill, which replicates the requirements of GDPR ahead of Brexit.&nbsp;The new bill allows the ICO to issue fines of up to &pound;17 million, or four per cent of global turnover, whichever is highest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A controversial Facebook AI tool could soon be making a return to Europe and Canada.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facial recognition, launched in 2010, suggests names for people it identifies in photos uploaded by users.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was suspended for users in Europe in 2012 over privacy concerns, but still lives on in the US and other regions worldwide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now the firm says it will make a comeback,&nbsp;using the new European data protection regulations as a chance to collect more information if users opt in.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The move to reintroduce the image scanning software is likely to ruffle feathers, coming in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica data handling debacle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Private information taken from 87 million users was supplied to the consultancy firm, which was working for Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scroll down for video&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook claims its facial recognition technology helps people manage their identity online.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It can also help the visually impaired know who is shown in a photo.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it also provide Facebook with a huge amount of data on an individual, such as who they are friends with and where their location.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook will begin to ask users if they want to opt in or out of the facial recognition feature under the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) this week, ahead of it coming into force on May 25.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the new policy, Facebook users will also be asked to review and make choices about ads they receive, including whether they want Facebook to use data from third parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They will also be asked to review and choose what to share about the political, religious, and relationship information on their profiles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These are designed to ensure the Menlo Park, California, firm complies with the forthcoming EU rules, with European residents seeing the measures first.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Everyone - no matter where they live - will be asked to review important information about how Facebook uses data and make choices about their privacy on Facebook,' chief privacy officer Erin Egan and deputy general counsel Ashlie Beringer said in a written statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement also said users will be told that facial recognition is optional, but that it could offer some benefit, such as being notified when someone is using an unauthorised picture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We not only want to comply with the law, but also go beyond our obligations to build new and improved privacy experiences for everyone on Facebook,' Ms Egan and Ms Beringer wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GPDR aims to strengthen and unify data protection for all individuals within the European Union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This means cracking down on how companies use and sell the data they collect on their users.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The law will mark the biggest overhaul of personal data privacy rules since the birth of the internet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under GDPR, companies will be required to report data breaches within 72 hours, as well as to allow customers to export their data and delete it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The laws will be welcome news to anyone affected by the Cambridge Analytica scandal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg faced ten hours of questioning in two congressional panels last week, following revelations that personal data was harvested by the British consultancy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zuckerberg testified that Facebook intends to offer the same privacy protections embodied in GDPR for its worldwide users, but that there could be some differences in format.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Egan and Ms Beringer said Facebook users in the EU will start seeing the requests this week so they can make choices before May 25.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'As part of our phased approach, people in the rest of the world will be asked to make their choices on a slightly later schedule,' they said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They added that Facebook would take steps to comply with the EU rules that limit advertising and public viewing of data for teens.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This will mean no use of facial recognition for anyone under age 18 and limitations on who can see certain information teens have shared.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To comply with GDPR, Facebook will also limit what it shows to users between the ages of 13 and 15 unless they get permission from a parent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday it emerged a US federal judge has ruled Facebook will face a class action law suit in the wake of its privacy scandal.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Allegations of privacy violations emerged when it was revealed the app used a photo-scanning tool on users' images without their explicit consent.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under Illinois state law, the company could be fined $1,000 to $5,000 (&pound;700 to &pound;3,500) each time a person's image was used without consent.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is believed that the function runs afoul of Illinois state law on protecting biometric privacy.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judge James Donato ruled the claims by Illinois residents Nimesh Patel, Adam Pezen, and Carlo Licata were 'sufficiently cohesive to allow for a fair and efficient resolution on a class basis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Consequently, the case will proceed with a class consisting of Facebook users located in Illinois for whom Facebook created and stored a face template after June 7, 2011,' he said, according to the ruling.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook rolled out its 'tag suggestions' feature in June 2011.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The feature is not currently available to users in most countries, including the UK - and can be turned off in settings for US users.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook believe that the lawsuit should be pursued by individual as the total amount of damages could 'amount to billions of dollars,' U.S. District Judge James Donato wrote in the ruling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The judge has ruled that the Illinois law is clear: Facebook has collected a 'wealth of data on its users, including self-reported residency and IP addresses,' reports Bloomberg.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook has acknowledged that it can identify which users who live in Illinois have face templates, he wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A face template can be generated from ten or more photos and is used to generate a profile on Facebook's database.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Although many individuals may not have had enough tagged photos to generate a face template in Facebook's database, in January 2011 [when Facebook implemented tag suggestions for all users] the average user was tagged in 53 photos, far more than the 10 needed to generate a face template,' according to a December court filing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Facebook spokeswoman said the company was reviewing the decision, adding: 'We continue to believe the case has no merit and will defend ourselves vigorously.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook also contends it has been very open about the tool since its inception.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As well as allowing users to turn the feature off, the Zuckerberg-owned app lets users prevent themselves from being suggested in photo tags.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also emerged this week that secret surveillance software created by a former Israeli intelligence officer is harvesting Facebook photos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The firm behind it,&nbsp;Face-Int i, is taking profile images from the social network, YouTube and other sites to build a huge facial recognition database.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Its creators say the software could lead to the identification of terror suspects, captured in promotional and other material posted online.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook is struggling to reassert a positive public image in the wake of theCambridge Analyticascandal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg has appeared in front of US lawmakers and pledged to do more to support privacy concerns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, it is the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), thatFacebookhas to worry about in the short term as it comes into force on May 25 and will impose strict fines for breaches of privacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The social network has today revealed the steps it is taking to comply with GDPR and some privacy experts are sceptical.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     How has technology changed? The biggest advancements in tech and how they've changed our lives                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ablog postfrom Erin Egan , Facebook's VP and Chief Privacy Officer for Policy and Ashlie Beringer VP and Deputy General Counsel explained what the company is doing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everyone - no matter where they live - will be asked to review important information about how Facebook uses data and make choices about their privacy on Facebook. We'll begin by rolling these choices out in Europe this week,&quot; they said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Web searches to delete Facebook DOUBLED in the UK following Cambridge Analytica data breach                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the changes are new options for people to review how Facebook uses their information with particular emphasis on special categories of data - such as political, religious or health-based information that draws the requirement of explicit consent under GDPR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you've chosen to share political, religious, and relationship information on your profile, we'll ask you to choose whether to continue sharing and letting us use this information,&quot; the blog post says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As always, including this information on your profile is completely optional. We're making it easier for people to delete it if they no longer want to share it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook doesn't sell adverts based on this information, but it also doesn't make it easy to opt out of having this data processed. Users will have to manually go into their settings to make sure collection of this information is disabled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Hackers have become so 'lazy' they're just using automated attacking tools, study finds                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The General Data Protection Regulation includes biometric data as a form of personal data for the first time in privacy law and Facebook tackles this with its new policy on facial recognition tech. So far, the face-scanning part of the network hasn't been available in the EU - but that's going to change if users want to have it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've offered products using face recognition in most of the world for more than six years. As part of this update, we're now giving people in the EU and Canada the choice to turn on face recognition,&quot; the blog post says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Again though, if you want to switch it off, you'll need to navigate through the settings to switch it off - rather than just hitting the big, blue &quot;Accept and Continue&quot; button.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a useful feature that can make sure people know about the photos of them floating around,&quot;wrote TechCrunch's Josh Constine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But here the lack of granularity is concerning. Users might want to see warnings about possible impersonators using their face in their profile pics, but not be suggested as someone to tag in their friends' photos. Unfortunately, it's all or nothing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FB GDPR 1</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Facebook is getting sued over its facial recognition system that suggests people to 'tag' in photos                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under GDPR, companies wanting to process the personal data of anyone below the age of 16 must have consent for a parent or guardian. Crucially, member states have the option to lower this if they choose. The UK has already indicated it will drop the age of consent to 13.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook says it has made a number of changes that will affect younger users.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For example, advertising categories for teens are more limited, and their default audience options for posts do not include &quot;public.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We also keep face recognition off for anyone under age 18 and limit who can see or search specific information teens have shared, like hometown or birthday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Under GDPR, people between the ages of 13 and 15 in some EU countries need permission from a parent or guardian to allow some features on Facebook - seeing ads based on data from partners and including religious and political views or &quot;interested in&quot; on your profile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These teens will see a less personalized version of Facebook with restricted sharing and less relevant ads until they get permission from a parent or guardian to use all aspects of Facebook.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Facebook seems to make it very easy for anyone to be a selected parent or guardian - all the teen has to do is enter an email address or select another friend designated as their guardian. That person (or alternate email address) can then give consent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Why you won't #DeleteFacebook even though everyone says you should                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mark Zuckerberg seemed to be pro-GDPR at his recent testimonials in front of Congress, but the social network has a vested interest in collecting as much personal data as possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With fines amounting to as much as 4% of global annual turnover for noncompliance, GDPR is one rule that Facebook has to pay attention to. And the principles laid out in the regulation are likely to become the new base level of privacy by design given it applies to any product or service that targets an EU national.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FB for GDPR 2</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GDPR does say that lawful processing criteria for personal data includes that which is manifestly made public by the data subject.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook is also within its rights to say processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So while the social network is bringing its compliance up to the minimum acceptable standard, privacy experts continue to be doubtful about how much it will really change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mark Weinstein, one of the world's foremost privacy advocates, told Mirror Tech: &quot;Even with GDPR, Facebook won't give up its way of doing business. Skin deep fixes yes, for compliance sake, but not an inch more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Facebook will make minimal changes not fundamental ones, no way. Even with full transparency, the company will never be fully transparent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And if the truth doesn't gibe with the company's bottom line, they'll find a way to bury it underneath the announcement of an amazing new feature.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook will stop teenagers from sharing religious and sexual preferences without parental permission, in a bid to toe the line with incoming data protection law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those who have created a profile and stated that they are aged between 13 and 15 will be prompted to remove these categories from their profile, or get a parent or guardian to consent to them sharing. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook is making the sweeping changes to stay compliant with European data protection law, the General Data Protection Regulation, which comes into force on May 25.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under GDPR, people under 15 will need permission from a parent or guardian to allow some features on Facebook like seeing ads based on data from partners and including religious and political views or &quot;interested in&quot; on their profile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Teenagers can nominate someone to approve sharing these preferences by selecting someone from their friends list or by entering an email address. Facebook will not independently verify the nominee is their parent or guardian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Accounts for this age group will have the default &quot;public&quot; post settings switched off and face recognition on photos will be turned off those those under 18.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook said it will ask every teenager if they want to see adverts based on information from third parties and remind them when they are including personal information in their profiles, a privacy control, even though the law does not require this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The changes follow revelations that Facebook had allowed a researcher to mine personal information of 87 million unsuspecting users, which was later sold to Cambridge Analytica, a company&nbsp;employed by Donald Trump and Ted Cruz during the run-up to the 2016 presidential election. Cambridge Analytica employee Brittany Kaiser said that she was certain that this was one of many colossal databases harvested from Facebook and later used by private companies to influence and snoop on people's online behaviours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Interactive: what does facebook know about you?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook's chief privacy officer Erin Egan said: &quot;As soon as GDPR was finalised, we realized it was an opportunity to invest even more heavily in privacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We not only want to comply with the law, but also go beyond our obligations to build new and improved privacy experiences for everyone on Facebook.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People of all ages will start to see changes on the social network, including pop-ups on their news feed alerting them of how facial recognition will work and improved Settings and Privacy shortcuts, where people can find details on how their information is being used to attract advertisers.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook is asking Britons to consent to the use of controversial facial-recognition technology while making it difficult to opt out, experts say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The social network uses the technology in the US to tag people in photos, but not in Europe because of concerns that it breaches EU privacy laws. However, the company said recently that it would introduce it under an opt-in system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The move comes as Facebook is placed under pressure from MPs and regulators after the Cambridge Analytica scandal over its failure to safeguard privacy. The UK consultancy, which is accused of electoral interference, obtained the data of tens of millions of Facebook users without their consent.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Britain Facebook users have started to see messages asking them to agree to facial recognition. Jennifer Cobbe, a researcher in technology law at Cambridge University, said that it was difficult to opt out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The message says that facial recognition is beneficial because it can alert users if someone impersonates them, and can tell people with visual impairments who is in a photo. There is no obvious &quot;No&quot; button; users who wish to opt-out need to go to a settings page.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Cobbe told Business Insider: &quot;By framing the request for consent to facial recognition as being about the user experience, about the user's security and about making Facebook more accessible for visually impaired people, rather than what it's actually about - which is Facebook's all-encompassing surveillance machine in which privacy is not an option - they're going about getting consent in a fundamentally dishonest and manipulative way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She believes that the technology would be illegal in Britain and the EU next month when the general data protection regulation (GDPR), comes into force, arguing that Facebook would have to scan the faces of people who opt out of facial recognition to check that they did not get treated as those who had given consent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said: &quot;So how does Facebook know that a face in a photo belongs to someone who hasn't consented to facial recognition? By using facial recognition. In practice Facebook won't just be using facial recognition for users who have consented - it is likely to be doing it for users who have explicitly said no as well as for people who appear in photos but don't even have Facebook accounts. You can't escape this by saying no. You can't even escape this by not having Facebook. Facebook will still scan your face.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jim Killock from the Open Rights Group, the privacy group, said: &quot;We agree that this agreement for facial recognition is unclear and will result in people agreeing to something they do not want. As such it is unlikely to be GDPR-compliant.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week Facebook was served with a class action lawsuit in the US from users who claim that facial recognition breaches state laws on privacy. In Illinois the district judge James Donato ruled that the social network must face the suit over allegations that it gathered biometric information without the explicit consent of users.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook's lawyers say that the case has no merit and they will defend the company vigorously.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Facebook spokeswoman said yesterday that the company was working to make sure that its services complied with GDPR: &quot;We recently began to preview some of the changes. These included the opportunity to opt in to facerecognition features. We also provided information about improved privacy controls and details of how our services work.&quot; ? Facebook enabled developers to access the data of friends of app users without their knowledge until two weeks ago, despite claiming to have closed the loophole in 2014. This enabled Cambridge Analytica to gather data on &quot;far more&quot; than 87 million people, a whistleblower has claimed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook is asking Britons to consent to the use of controversial facial-recognition technology while making it difficult to opt out, experts say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The social network uses the technology in the US to tag people in photos, but not in Europe because of concerns that it breaches EU privacy laws. However, the company said recently that it would introduce it under an opt-in system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The move comes as Facebook is placed under pressure from MPs and regulators after the Cambridge Analytica scandal over its failure to safeguard privacy. The UK consultancy, which is accused of electoral interference, obtained the data of tens of millions of Facebook users without their consent.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Britain Facebook users have started to see messages asking them to agree to facial recognition. Jennifer Cobbe, a researcher in technology law at Cambridge University, said that it was difficult to opt out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The message says that facial recognition is beneficial because it can alert users if someone impersonates them, and can tell people with visual impairments who is in a photo. There is no obvious &quot;No&quot; button; users who wish to opt-out need to go to a settings page.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Cobbe told Business Insider: &quot;By framing the request for consent to facial recognition as being about the user experience, about the user's security and about making Facebook more accessible for visually impaired people, rather than what it's actually about - which is Facebook's all-encompassing surveillance machine in which privacy is not an option - they're going about getting consent in a fundamentally dishonest and manipulative way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She believes that the technology would be illegal in Britain and the EU next month when the general data protection regulation (GDPR), comes into force, arguing that Facebook would have to scan the faces of people who opt out of facial recognition to check that they did not get treated as those who had given consent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said: &quot;So how does Facebook know that a face in a photo belongs to someone who hasn't consented to facial recognition? By using facial recognition. In practice Facebook won't just be using facial recognition for users who have consented - it is likely to be doing it for users who have explicitly said no as well as for people who appear in photos but don't even have Facebook accounts. You can't escape this by saying no. You can't even escape this by not having Facebook. Facebook will still scan your face.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jim Killock from the Open Rights Group, the privacy group, said: &quot;We agree that this agreement for facial recognition is unclear and will result in people agreeing to something they do not want. As such it is unlikely to be GDPR-compliant.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week Facebook was served with a class action lawsuit in the US from users who claim that facial recognition breaches state laws on privacy.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SIR - No wonder Germany declares it will take no military action over the chemical attack in Syria. The Gazprom scandal ( report, April 13 ) lays bare the hypocrisy of the EU and Germany.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the one hand Britain is told we can't have a bespoke trade deal, as the same rules apply to all 27 nations. On the other, Germany &quot;negotiates&quot; a deal with Russia's state-backed Gazprom to receive gas more cheaply than other EU nations. This goes against EU regulations, but, since it is Germany, a blind eye is turned, while poorer neighbours suffer far higher rates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To add insult to injury, Germany then pushes Gazprom's agenda with Brussels to undermine EU regulations further, yet no action is taken.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moral cowardice and an agenda that serves Germany's economy above all others in the EU are clear for all to see.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having served in the military, I lived in Germany for 12 years and loved the people and the country. They have clearly lost their way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Mike McKone                      Kirkby Stephen, Cumbria</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SIR - Watching the news and seeing the apparent willingness of France and Britain to side with President Donald Trump of the United States over the alleged chemical attack in Syria (foolish though that may seem), I wondered why Germany for all its size was not supporting the initiative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now I've read in The Daily Telegraph about the cosy arrangement that Germany has with Russia for its gas supplies, it has become clear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Germany spends less than Britain on overseas aid, and is not, it seems, paying its correct contribution to Nato. It clearly intends to prosper to the detriment of its EU partners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     George Gooden                      Woodbridge, Suffolk</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SIR - It is all very well for various politicians and commentators to encourage Theresa May to take action against the Syrian regime without recourse to Parliament, but they could establish a precedent that, heaven forfend, could enable a future prime minister, Jeremy Corbyn, to do likewise. And goodness knows whom he would have in his sights.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SIR - At this dangerous moment for Britain and the world, we should recall that a month ago the Government was considering scrapping key naval ships and a Royal Marine commando.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What happens next in Syria - could Britain be drawn into World War Three?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SIR &nbsp;- I expect an American President to be statesmanlike, dignified, measured and a model of integrity in times of international crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead we are treated to outbursts of a kind that one would expect from a precocious but immature sixth-former.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SIR - Your front-page report &quot;Police abandon two in three burglary victims as crime soars&quot; ( April 7 ) was no surprise to me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I provided the police with clear CCTV footage of two women coming into my driveway and going behind the garage to the back gate. The footage of them leaving clearly showed their car and registration number. All the police had to do was check the registration number with the DVLA, approach the owner of the vehicle and ask for an explanation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All they said was: &quot;The registration alone, on this occasion, does not allow us to identify these females.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is it any wonder that very few people can find a good word to say about the police?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SIR - It appears that all businesses, large or small, are to be bound by extremely onerous new rules under General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which come into force on May 25.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a glance | Your data rights                   Sore throat test                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SIR - Dr Tony McAllister ( Letters, April 11 ) asks why quick tests for diagnosing sore throats are not available at GPs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have recently returned from Austria where two of our daughters had sore throats tested in the local doctor's surgery. The doctor took a pin prick of blood, which was then analysed to detect whether they were suffering from a viral or bacterial infection. It took less than two minutes and on receipt of the results appropriate medication was administered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What concerned us was how amazed we were that such &quot;modern&quot; medicine existed. Clearly our NHS is something out of the third world.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SIR - The Longitude Committee decided to award a substantial amount of money to the person or team who devised a simple, fast and cheap test to distinguish between viral and bacterial infection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Has the prize been awarded?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Dr P E Pears                      Coleshill, Warwickshire</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   The risks from planes roaring over London                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SIR - Surely it is time to act when the Queen says that the aircraft noise over London is excessive ( report, April 10 ).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1955, while visiting London to watch the Boat Race, I could see that it was unsafe to have routine flights over Fulham football ground - which can contain 25,000 people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only thing that has changed is that there are more flights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Geoffrey Cullington                      Dorchester</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UK's busiest airports</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SIR - The Queen makes a very good point, having, as she does, a house at each end of Heathrow's runway. Here in mid-Sussex, fast becoming one of the more densely populated areas of the country, the intrusion into normal life and conversation is continual.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many moons ago, we were assured that there would be a ban on jets between 11 at night and six in the morning. We were also told that pilots, with the co-operation of air traffic control, would operate a continuous descent procedure, meaning less noise and less pollution. It would appear that both of these promises have been eroded to a farcical extent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the jet ban were in place, why would Gatwick's operations in the middle of the night be disrupted by <SPAN style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&#8232;</SPAN>a lack of controllers, as was recently reported?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why too is there a holding pattern in Sussex between Ditchling Beacon and Hickstead, now an area of housing development, when the procedure could be moved south and out to sea?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SIR&nbsp;- I read the article on Anne Craig, a &quot;personal development coach&quot; accused of encouraging her clients to sever all contact with their families ( Magazine, April 7 ), with my heart in my mouth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have a daughter who used to be very close to me, but&nbsp;after having cognitive therapy she has refused to have any contact with me for many years. Therefore, I have no contact with my grandchildren either. I am disabled and not in good health, which I know someone has told her, but still nothing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have been advised that the damage is done, and there is probably nothing I could do now to heal the situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is terrifying that vulnerable people seeking help through therapy should be turned against their families in this way. Clearly the law needs to be changed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SIR - I acquired my property deeds from my solicitor (Letters, April 13) and they make fascinating reading.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I particularly like the instructions that there must not be any trade or business as a publican, beerhouse keeper, broken-soap boiler, sugar baker, distiller, dyer, glass maker, tripe boiler or tallow-candle maker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Furthermore, there can be no tempering of saws, steel or cast iron and no steam or engine house. Finally, I cannot have a slaughter house but it must be a private dwelling house.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What a loss it would have been had this information disappeared because the deeds had been destroyed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SIR - Because the Earth circles the Sun in a strange ellipse (the analemmatic curve), clock time and Sun time are only in harmony four times a year. Tomorrow, Sunday April 15, is one of these days, Christmas Day being one of the others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mid-afternoon tomorrow,&nbsp;if the Sun shines, is an ideal time to synchronise your garden sundial to the correct clock time.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instagram has confirmed it will let users download their personal data, including previously shared photos, videos and messages, as it prepares for the European data regulation GDPR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While its parent company, Facebook, had announced a suite of GDPR controls, which Mark Zuckerberg emphasised during his testimony to Congress this week, Instagram had been quiet on the issue.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) brings with it a number of rights for individuals, including to demand deletion of data, to opt out of future data collection, and to view the personal data a company possesses and to download it in a format that can be moved over to competitors. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These were the requirements Instagram would fulfil shortly, the company confirmed to TechCrunch. &quot;We are building a new data portability tool,&quot; a spokesperson said. &quot;You'll soon be able to download a copy of what you've shared on Instagram, including your photos, videos and messages.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tool will be helpful for users who want to extract what they have uploaded to Instagram. Treasured photos and videos can sometimes get lost in their original form, but currently there are few ways to easily access the high-resolution originals if they have been posted on the social network. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is unclear whether the company will also include details of a user's advertising profiling in its data download. The wealth of information included in Facebook's equivalent service shocked some users, who were unhappy to discover that the company had tracked metadata of their text and phone conversations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GDPR comes into effect on 25 May, which means the coming month will probably include a flurry of announcements similar to Instagram's. Many large tech companies, including Google, have yet to confirm whether they are altering their products to comply with the regulation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A number of data breaches may also be made public next month as companies race to beat the GDPR deadline. When the regulation comes into effect, the maximum penalty for a breach multiplies vastly from &pound;600,000 to (EURO)20m (&pound;17m), or 4% of global turnover.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to EUObserver, the European commission intends to police that deadline according to the date of disclosure, not the date of the underlying breach. This means any company that has been withholding knowledge of a successful hack will need to disclose that fact sooner rather than later, or risk a hefty penalty.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pop-ups appearing in Facebook Messenger are asking European users to review their privacy settings to continue using the app.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The notification has been prompted by the strict new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) ahead of laws taking force on 25 May.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GDPR&nbsp;is designed to bring tech firms like Google and Facebook into line amid mounting concerns over the way they collect and share private user data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It comes as&nbsp;Mark Zuckerberg sat down before Congress to address issues surrounding the Cambridge Analytica scandal this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Latest estimates suggest more than 87 million users may have had their data mined by the firm through the 'This Is Your Digital Life' quiz.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In recent days, it also emerged that private conversations on&nbsp;Messenger may have fallen into the hands of the British consultancy firm - a claim the company denies.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scroll down for video&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Initial reports of the&nbsp;pop-up began appearing online yesterday via Business Insider, with the notification opening when the Messenger app was accessed via smartphones and tablets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It reads: 'Important Updates to Review. Please review your data settings by 25 May to continue using Messenger.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clicking on the 'Review Now' button redirects users to the settings section for the app, although some consumers claim that this didn't work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This could suggest that, much like the 'Protecting Your Information' app launched for Facebook itself in recent days, the firm may be testing it out with a limited release before a full global roll-out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GPDR aims to strengthen and unify data protection for all individuals within the European Union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This means cracking down on how companies use and sell the data they collect on their users.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The law will mark the biggest overhaul of personal data privacy rules since the birth of the internet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under GDPR, companies will be required to report data breaches within 72 hours, as well as to allow customers to export their data and delete it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The laws will be welcome news to anyone affected by the Cambridge Analytica scandal.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A previously unknown disclosure about Messenger messages was buried in the fine print of a&nbsp;Protecting Your Information' app,&nbsp;created to address user concerns about the data leak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It checks whether you or your friends logged into the 'This Is Your Digital Life' quiz responsible for the data grab.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the social network's  2.2 billion users have already begun to receive automatic notifications on their newsfeed&nbsp;as part of a gradual global rollout.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Privacy concerned Facebook users who have yet to receive&nbsp;the message can also access this information manually from&nbsp;a new section in its Help Centre site.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'This Is Your Digital Life' was designed by Cambridge University researcher Aleksandr Kogan's Global Science Research in 2014 to collect data on Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Users who gave permission for the quiz to run also granted it permission to mine their profile for additional information, including their page 'likes', their birthday and the city they live in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thanks to a quirk in the way Facebook worked at the time, the app was also able to harvest similar data on a user's friends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was then passed on to Cambridge Analytica through its parent firm&nbsp;Strategic Communication Laboratories (SCL).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Small print in the new 'Protecting Your Information' and related Help Centre page, which went largely unnoticed upon release, hinted at the inclusion of data from private messages in this process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Writing in it, a Facebook spokesman said: 'A small number of people who logged into &quot;This Is Your Digital Life&quot; also shared their own News Feed, timeline, posts and messages which may have included posts and messages from you.'&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Menlo Park firm Facebook has now confirmed to&nbsp; Wired &nbsp;that the quiz&nbsp;requested access to user's Messenger inboxes through a read_mailbox permission contained in its coding.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ability for apps to collect information on a user's friends was phased out in April 2015, unless both people had the same app installed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the read_mailbox permission didn't go out of operation until that October.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook estimates that a total of 1,500 people granted This Is Your Digital Life this permission in that time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anyone who messaged those people or received messages from them on Facebook may be caught up in the leak, so the true number could be far higher.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Cambridge Analytica denies having accessed this data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokesman added: 'GSR did not share the content of any private messages with Cambridge Analytica or SCL Elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Neither company has ever handled such data.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Affected users are now being automatically presented with a notice that says: 'We have banned the website 'This Is Your Digital Life,' which one of your friends used Facebook to log into.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We did this because the website may have misused some of your Facebook information by sharing it with a company called Cambridge Analytica.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For those not affected by the Cambridge Analytica incident the message reads: 'You can go to the Apps and Websites section of your settings anytime to see the apps and websites you've used Facebook to log into.'&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A separate webpage, 'How can I tell if my info was shared with Cambridge Analytica?', will also resolve the question for you.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To manually access this site, click the link&nbsp; here.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Users not believed to be affected will see the message 'Based on our available records, neither you nor your friends logged into &quot;This Is Your Digital Life&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'As a result, it doesn't appear your Facebook information was shared with Cambridge Analytica by &quot;This Is Your Digital Life&quot;.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Affected users will see a different message and they will be asked to to change their app settings, available here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is something that is still advisable for the security conscious, removing permissions for apps you no longer need or don't recognise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook is not notifying individual users of the identify of friends who may have used the 'This Is Your Digital Life' app.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook is still reeling from its worst privacy crisis in history, which saw Trump -affiliated company Cambridge Analytica use the data mined to try and influence the US presidential election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The whistleblower behind the revelations about the consultancy firm says the true number affected by the scandal could be far higher than estimated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new tools came a day later than expected, with many criticising Facebook for a lack of communication.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a written statement yesterday, Mike Schroepfer, chief technology officer at Facebook said: 'Starting on Monday, April 9, we'll show people a link at the top of their News Feed so they can see what apps they use - and the information they have shared with those apps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'People will also be able to remove apps that they no longer want. As part of this process we will also tell people if their information may have been improperly shared with Cambridge Analytica.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Overall, we believe these changes will better protect people's information while still enabling developers to create useful experiences. We know we have more work to do - and we'll keep you updated as we make more changes.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Experts say the revelations may trigger a wave of lawsuits.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A class action lawsuit filed against the firm is now seeking compensation for the roughly 70 million US users who were affected as 'Facebook stood idly by' while Cambridge Analytica 'sucked down' their data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook says most of the users caught up in the Cambridge Analytica scandal are in the US, with more than a million each in the Philippines, Indonesia and the UK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">US law firm Hagens Berman filed the class-action suit with the US District Court for the Northern District of California on April 9 to represent the millions of Americans whose data were shared improperly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Damages in this case include both the dissemination of personal information and the loss of its sales value.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's not yet clear how much money the affected users could be compensated, though lawyers in the UK have estimated it could be upwards of &pound;10,000 to &pound;12,500 ($14,000 to $17,000) for some.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The amounts, however, will ultimately be determined at trial, Hagens Berman says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In March, three users of the Facebook Messenger app sued Facebook, saying the social network violated their privacy by collecting logs of their phone calls and text messages, in the latest legal challenge facing the company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US lawsuit filed in federal court in the Northern District of California seeks status as a class action on behalf of all affected users and asks for unspecified damages.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's not clear yet if Facebook users in the US could claim similar compensation for having their data compromised as part of the Cambridge Analytica scandal.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, dispute resolution lawyer Jonathan Compton has said those affected in the UK could complain to the Information Commissioner's Office or make a claim through the civil courts on the grounds that losing their data had been 'distressing'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Compton, a partner at DMH Stallard, said: 'The start point for any award might be between &pound;10,000 and &pound;12,500. This will vary of course if the personal information is comparatively trivial or very serious and damaging.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cambridge Analytica whistleblower Christopher Wylie revealed in March that the political firm had improperly collected the data of millions of Facebook users without their consent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He previously estimated that more than 50 million people were compromised by a personality quiz that collected their data and that of their friends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Schroepfer last week upped this to around 87 million users.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And in an interview aired Sunday on NBC's 'Meet the Press,'&nbsp; Mr Wylie revised this number saying that it could actually be larger than 87 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I think that it could be higher, absolutely,' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The initial conservative estimate, Mr Wylie explained, was made based on evidence in his possession at the time, adding that The Guardian, who broke the story, published only what could be verified at the time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cambridge Analytica, run by former White House senior adviser Steve Bannon and billionaire campaign benefactor Robert Mercer, was hired by the Trump campaign during the 2016 election.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook is in full damage-control mode, with Mark Zuckerberg acknowledging he's made a 'huge mistake' in failing to take a broad enough view of what Facebook's responsibility is in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zuckerberg testified before Congress on Tuesday and Wednesday in two-high profile public hearings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A number of topics were discussed, from the firm's business model, user privacy and targeted ads to extremist content and hate speech.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During testimony before a joint hearing with the Senate judiciary and commerce committees, Zuckerberg was grilled on a range of subjects.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This included special counsel Robert Mueller's investigations, data privacy , Russian exploitation , political bias, the firm's business model and hate speech on the social network.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zuckerberg has said Facebook came up with the 87 million figure by calculating the maximum number of friends that users could have had while Kogan's app was collecting data.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company doesn't have logs going back that far, he said, so it can't know exactly how many people may have been affected.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cambridge Analytica previously said in a statement that it had data for only 30 million people.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zuckerberg took out full-page adverts in nine major US and British newspapers in late March to apologise for the Cambridge Analytica scandal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the ads, the Facebook founder vowed to clamp down on allowing third parties access to data which can be sold on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ads, done in simple black text against a plain white background, were headlined: 'We have a responsibility to protect your information. If we can't, we don't deserve it.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'You may have heard about a quiz app built by a university researcher that leaked Facebook data of millions of people in 2014,' the apology begins.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'This was a breach of trust, and I'm sorry we didn't do more at the time. We're now taking steps to make sure this doesn't happen again.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We've already stopped apps like this from getting so much information. Now we're limiting the data apps get when you sign in using Facebook.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We're also investigating every single app that had access to large amounts of data before we fixed this. We expect there are others. And when we find them, we will ban them and tell everyone affected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Finally, we'll remind you which apps you've given access to your information - so you can shut off the ones you don't want anymore.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Thank you for believing in this community. I promise to do better for you.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The apology was formally signed off by the Facebook chief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Facebook data scandal deepened after users found the social network had harvested information including call logs and text messages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some users discovered the firm had been storing complete logs of incoming and outgoing calls and text messages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others reported that data such as contacts in their address books, social events in their calendars and even friends' birthdays had been stored.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company says an opt-out for uploading contacts is available and users can delete all uploaded contacts by turning off the continuous uploading setting in Facebook's Messenger app.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All previously uploaded contacts are deleted when a user permanently removes their profile. Contacts will also no longer continue to be uploaded.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The backlash against Facebook has had some people hunting for the &quot;delete&quot; button on the social network, but even privacy conscious internet users&nbsp;most don't realise that even if you've tried to stay a stranger to Facebook&nbsp;the social network still knows&nbsp;a whole lot about you.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday in a hearing in the US Congress, Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg was pressed over the company's tracking of users outside of Facebook. Politicians questioned how Facebook gathers data from non-users, so-called &quot;shadow profiles&quot;, or data on people outside the social network.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zuckerberg has repeatedly said that Facebook users alone have control over what data they choose to share with Facebook. But US representative Ben Lujan of New Mexico, berated Zuckerberg over the lack of transparency over third-party tracking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You are collecting data on people who are not even Facebook users&quot;, Lujan said. &quot;Who have never signed a privacy agreement.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lujan said that even when users who don't have a Facebook account who want to find their data&nbsp; the site may hold on them, Facebook redirects them to a page where they have to log-in to their, non-existent, account to find out what Facebook knows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here is some of the data Facebook can scrape from you, even if you don't have a profile:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   Name, email and phone number from your friends                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When a user signs up for Facebook, the site prompts them to upload a list of contacts so Facebook can try and find friends for you. There is also a tab in the Facebook app for uploading contacts from your smartphone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When starting up the app, one of the first things Facebook suggests is syncing your contacts with the app - including data on names, email and phone numbers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While this may seem innocuous, as it allows&nbsp;Facebook to send out invites to other friends, importantly it means it has already started building up the first pieces of profile data about people who have never consented to have their data shared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook also uses this data to build up its People You May Know service, which tries to link you to people it thinks are friends. Again, this comes under Facebook's &quot;mission&quot; of connecting people, but not everybody will want that personal data to be accessed by the social network.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And, when you go to Facebook to try and check if it has collected this data, the site directs you to your Facebook profile, even if you have never created one in the first place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   Data from Like and Share buttons on other websites                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is another way that Facebook can pick up information about you, even if you don't sign up to the site. Have you seen those little Like and Share buttons on most websites? Those are Facebook buttons, installed on websites to make sharing of articles and links easier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, these buttons are hosted by Facebook itself. So if you visit a page with one of these buttons, the likelihood is Facebook can see data about where you have been browsing and what other Facebook linked sites you have visited. It won't give up any personally identifiable information, but it is your browsing data that Facebook is able to see.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   Data from Facebook Pixel and web trackers                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even more hidden than these sharing tools is Facebook Pixel, a web tracker that lives in many third-party Facebook pages. The Pixel is a tool for advertisers, designed to measure all kinds of analytics, and again is in common use by the industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the Pixel makes it possible to track Facebook users even if they are logged out of Facebook by monitoring data like their IP address. This can be used, for example, to follow a user and target an advert them if they have&nbsp;added an item to their shopping cart in an only store, but not decided to buy it yet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That said, lots of websites use similar tools and trackers, but for Zuckerberg to claim the user has significant control over this is not correct. Facebook has been engaged in a legal dispute against Belgium over the very use of these trackers, and it remains to be seen if GDPR will require changes in how this works.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It can't be denied that Facebook is an advertising giant and that data is its currency (despite one senator appearing confused and asking how Facebook makes money without subscriptions), but it will worry some not on&nbsp;Facebook that the site can build up a profile of them without their knowledge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Rep. Lujan put it: &quot;You've said everyone controls their data, but you're collecting data on people who are not even Facebook users who have never signed a consent, a privacy agreement.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                                        Mark Zuckerberg is just like us                                      </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His data was sold to a malicious third party as well, he confirmed, in an answer to a question from the Democratic representative Anna Eshoo. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook is refusing to explicitly confirm that this malicious third party is GSR, the company started by the Cambridge University researcher Alexsandr Kogan. But since - as Zuckerberg has also repeatedly said - the investigations into other companies are not yet complete, it is hard to think who else it might be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Mark Zuckerberg says his personal data was included in Cambridge Analytica breach -&nbsp;live</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zuckerberg's admission makes it harder than ever for Facebook to claim that its platform circa 2013 was fit for purpose: if even the CEO cannot lock down his privacy settings, who can? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                                        Facebook is declaring war on Cambridge University                                      </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zuckerberg implied that Facebook had only just discovered that the university has a large psychographics research team, and he is shocked. &quot;There's a whole programme associated with Cambridge,&quot; he said, &quot;with a number of researchers who were building similar apps&quot; to that constructed by Kogan. Cambridge was also implicated in the banning of a second data broker, Cubeyou, from Facebook on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zuckerberg said they needed to understand whether &quot;something bad&quot; was going on at Cambridge University, and implied that if Facebook discovers something amiss, it may consider suing the institution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                                        Regulation is very much on the table                                      </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But in the meantime, the EU's general data protection regulation (GDPR) is everyone's favourite. Time and again, senators and representatives suggested new regulations would be the only possible response to the scandal. &quot;This incident yet again shows that our laws aren't working,&quot; said Frank Pallone, the ranking member of the house committee on energy and commerce, in his opening remarks. &quot;I was happy to hear Mr Zuckerberg concede that his industry needed to be regulated. We need comprehensive privacy and data protection legislation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nature of that regulation, of course, is what the real fight will be. As representative Fred Upton noted, &quot;a more regulatory environment might stifle new platforms, might stifle competition&quot; - something, of course, that Facebook might not be too unhappy about. Of course, Upton's follow-up question - asking Zuckerberg what regulation he would like to see - does not seem like the best way to shackle Facebook.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in the meantime, European regulators are suddenly the heroes of the day. Multiple congressional representatives asked Zuckerberg whether or not he would enforce GDPR for Americans, a question he repeatedly dodged by promising GDPR &quot;controls&quot; rather than &quot;protections&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                                        Facebook's American roots are a strength                                      </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Your success story is an American success story, embodying values such as freedom of speech and freedom of enterprise,&quot; said the committee chairman, Greg Walden, in his opening remarks. As on the previous day, Zuckerberg had responded to a question about breaking up the firm by noting that doing so would weaken the US's competitive advantage against China.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it is a tricky line to walk. At other times, Zuckerberg played up the company's global audience: something between 85-90% of Facebook's users are based outside the US, creating a raft of unique problems. Behind closed doors, Facebook explicitly refers to itself as a global company, not an American one, and the company knows its future growth is reliant on new international users.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                                        There are some questions Zuckerberg can't - or won't - answer                                      </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By the end of the second hearing, we had learned the areas Facebook wanted to avoid. Questions about its profiling prowess, for instance, were generally answered through misdirection. Asked who owns &quot;the virtual you&quot;, Zuckerberg's favoured response was to note that you own all the &quot;content&quot; you upload, and can delete it at will. That does not answer the question, of course: the advertising profile that Facebook builds up about you cannot be deleted, and you have no control over it. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similarly, Zuckerberg repeatedly tried to dodge the question of how much data Facebook holds about users' browsing behaviour. Speaking to the Senate, he rebuffed the question for a full minute before conceding that Facebook tracks that information, but argued that most users understand that and desire it. Speaking to the house, he carefully phrased his answer to note that browsing information is not part of &quot;your content&quot; - true, since you do not upload that information, but perhaps beside the point.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Summary  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zuckerberg got rougher treatment from the House of Representatives than he did from the Senate. While yesterday Zuckerberg was largely able to stick to his script, some of the representatives today pressed hard for information on Facebook's extensive tracking of users across the internet. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zuckerberg continued his strategy of deflecting questions and downplaying what Facebook does, but his (hopefully? presumably?) feigned ignorance of the core technology that made Facebook into the business it is simply doesn't hold water. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The overall impression I got was that, for all Zuck's assurances that targeted advertising is &quot;aligned&quot; with Facebook's &quot;social mission&quot;, the company has no interest in the general public actually knowing and understanding the extent of its ability to track users and amass data profiles of them. Almost every time he mentioned the &quot;control&quot; Facebook gives users over their content, he was avoiding answering a question about information that Facebook collects about users without their knowledge. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But don't just take my word for it. Here is my colleague Alex Hern's analysis of the hearing. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kevin Cramer, a Republican from North Dakota, is the final representative to speak. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cramer says he was dissatisfied with answers on opioid ads: How quickly could you take down an illegal drug site if there was a million dollar fine attached? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zuck says he's committed to being more pro-active.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cramer suggests that Facebook build a new headquarters in North Dakota, where the talent pool won't be so tainted by the Bay Area's liberal bias. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">block-time published-time 7.51pm BST </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Duncan says that the two biggest issues are privacy and censorship. &quot;Why not have a standard for free speech that is simply a mirror of the first amendment?&quot; he asks. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zuck says terrorist speech could be protected by the first amendment, and that we don't want it to spread on the internet. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">block-time published-time 7.48pm BST </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our second to last questioner is Jeff Duncan, a Republican from South Carolina, who starts off by noting that Facebook is invaluable to him. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Buddy Carter, a Republican from Georgia, is asking Zuck what he knows about opioid addictions. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After a few minutes on that, he brings up trafficking of ivory in private groups and piracy of movies. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carter gets to his point which is: Hate speech is difficult to figure out, but opioids, ivory trafficking, and movie piracy are not. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ryan Costello, a Republican from Pennsylvania: What pieces of GDPR would be properly placed in American jurisprudence? Should we have right to erasure? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zuck says he agrees with controls, and raises concern about sensitive tech like facial recognition. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Costello: Should you be able to deploy AI for facial recognition for a non-Facebook user?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zuck: That's a good question. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Costello: Are you ever a publisher? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zuck: If we commission and fund it, yes. Otherwise, no. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">block-time published-time 7.38pm BST </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Debbie Dingell, a Democrat from Michigan, hits Zuck hard on his apparent ignorance of his company's basic functions: &quot;As CEO you didn't know some key facts. You didn't know about key court cases regarding privacy and your company. You didn't know that the FTC doesn't have fining. You didn't know what a shadow profile is. You don't know how many apps you need to audit. You don't know what other companies were sold the Kogan data, even though you were asked that yesterday. You don't even know how many kinds of information you're logging.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dingell is the first to raise Facebook Pixel, another way that Facebook can track browsers across the internet. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dingell asks how many &quot;like&quot; buttons exist in the wilds of the internet? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zuck says he doesn't know.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dingell asks how many chunks of Pixel code are out there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zuck doesn't know. She asks for a 72 hour response. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">block-time published-time 7.34pm BST </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mimi Walters, a Republican from California, is showing screenshots of Facebook's privacy settings for apps and photos. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She asks, which control governs? Is it the app permissions? Or the user's decisions? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zuck explains the difference between app permissions and in-line controls on content. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Walters suggests this is difficult to understand, and asks why the controls aren't all in the same place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zuck says Facebook both keeps the controls in settings and also shows them to people when they are relevant. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">block-time published-time 7.29pm BST </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tim Walberg, a Republican from Michigan, asks who the bad actors that inspired Facebook to cut down on API permissions actually were.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zuck says developers who were taking information that wasn't relevant to their apps. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Walberg: Can Facebook guarantee that there will be no bad actors on apps on its platform? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zuck: This is an arms race. Guarantees are difficult.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Walberg: Can you assure me that ads and content are not being denied based on specific views?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zuck: Yes, politically. When it comes to &quot;normal political speech&quot;, but not for things like terrorism. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">block-time published-time 7.24pm BST </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the tidbits were legitimately interesting; others merely titillating. We now know how Zuck was prepared to respond to attacks (&quot;Respectfully, I reject that&quot;), that he was prepared to respond to calls for his resignation, and that he needed a bold-faced reminder that Facebook is not already compliant with forthcoming European data privacy standards. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But what should we call what happened with the notes? Was this a breach of Zuckerberg's privacy? Or did he, by leaving the information unprotected in a public space, &quot;share&quot; that information with us?

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday, Mark Zuckerberg was in the hot seat. Cameras surrounded him. The energy in the room - and on Twitter - was electric. At last, the reluctant CEO is made to answer some questions !</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Except it failed. It was designed to fail. It was a show designed to get Zuckerberg off the hook after only a few hours in Washington DC. It was a show that gave the pretense of a hearing without a real hearing. It was designed to deflect and confuse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Each senator was given less than five minutes for questions. That meant that there was no room for follow-ups, no chance for big discoveries and many frustratingly half-developed ideas. Compare that to Bill Gates' hearing on Microsoft, where he faced lawyers and staff for several days, or the Kefauver hearings, which were over a year. By design, you can't do a hearing of this magnitude in just a couple of hours. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We shouldn't be begging for Facebook's endorsement of laws, or for Mark Zuckerberg's promises of self-regulation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The worst moments of the hearing for us, as citizens, were when senators asked if Zuckerberg would support legislation that would regulate Facebook. I don't care whether Zuckerberg supports Honest Ads or privacy laws or GDPR. By asking him if he would support legislation, the senators elevated him to a kind of co-equal philosopher king whose view on Facebook regulation carried special weight. It shouldn't.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook is a known behemoth corporate monopoly. It has exposed at least 87 million people's data, enabled foreign propaganda and perpetuated discrimination. We shouldn't be begging for Facebook's endorsement of laws, or for Mark Zuckerberg's promises of self-regulation. We should treat him as a danger to democracy and demand our senators get a real hearing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Zuckerberg got off lightly. Why are politicians so bad at asking questions? | Jonathan Freedland</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The best senators understood this was a show, and used it as such. &quot;Your user agreement sucks,&quot; said John Kennedy. &quot;Are you a monopoly?&quot; asked Lindsey Graham. (Zuckerberg &quot;comically&quot; responded: &quot;It certainly doesn't feel like that to me.&quot;) Richard Blumenthal said we needed laws, not promises or apologies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because each senator was limited to under five minutes, Zuckerberg tried to run the clock by talking about mission, philosophy or what he believed in. There were some good questions, but there was little chance for follow up. You could almost see him, well-trained to count the minutes, playing for time when things got a little hot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senators Mazie Hirono and Cory Booker, for instance, both pointed out the damning reporting by Julia Angwin at ProPublica, which showed that employers and landlords were using Facebook for discriminatory ads. Zuckerberg defended the company by saying they were hard to flag, and that they depend on community flagging to stop them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tools Facebook provides make discrimination easy. Facebook has monopoly profit margins, so it could easily provide real staffing to protect against discrimination, if it wanted to. It doesn't want to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hirono and Booker could have shown that, but, like the rest of the senators, they each had only a few minutes for a line of questioning. Zuckerberg replied with vague answers about how their comments were &quot;important&quot; or &quot;interesting&quot; or &quot;an important conversation to have&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the hearing seemed designed to figure out whether Zuckerberg is a good or bad man, or whether he has a good or bad - or bizarre - political philosophy. Zuckerberg strikes me as reliably self-serving. That doesn't make him that interesting as the CEO of a corporate monopoly; it makes him a run-of-the-mill robber baron. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asking Zuckerberg philosophical questions, such as how he thinks we should deal with questions of hate speech, treats him as a thought leader. Accepting his failures to catch discriminatory housing ads, for instance, treats him as a good-hearted actor with limited resources, instead of someone who is making monopoly margins and billions in profits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In my view, we need to break up Facebook from Instagram and the other potential competitors that Facebook bought up. We need to - at a minimum - move towards opt-in, we need to hold Facebook responsible for enabling discrimination, and we need to require interoperability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But that's not enough. There is so much we don't know about Facebook. We know we have a corporate monopoly that has repeated serious violations that are threatening our democracy. We don't know how their algorithm treats news organizations or content producers, how Facebook uses its own information about Facebook users or how tracking across platforms works, to just give a few examples.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now that the initial show trial is done, we need the real deal, one where no senator gets cut off after a few minutes. The real hearing would allow for unlimited questions from each of our senators, who represent millions of people. If it takes two months of sitting in Washington DC, let it take two months. This is our democracy. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mark Zuckerberg expected senators to ask him to resign, his private notes have revealed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Facebook boss would have made clear that he had made mistakes and that the company had faced &quot;big challenges&quot;, they show. But he would say that it had faced such challenges before and succeeded, and would do the same this time around.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During his grilling by congress, Mr Zuckerberg left open the notes that he or an aide had prepared for the questioning. And the notes, which show the variety of ways that Mr Zuckerberg prepared, reveal what he was expecting from the questioning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the end, the questions were far more easy to deal with than the ones that Mr Zuckerberg had prepared for. As well as preparing for the unasked question ofwhether he would step down, the notes concentrate on other big questions - such as whether the company should be fined for harvesting data - but the questioning was largely kept to explaining Facebook's business model.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Zuckerberg's notes were briefly visible to an Associated Press photographer during a hearing Tuesday in which he answered questions about privacy, election interference and other issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Read more</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zuckerberg claims Facebook doesn't have a monopoly</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bullet-pointed pages include sections on &quot;diversity,&quot; &quot;competition,&quot; and GDPR, the European data-privacy rules that go into effect next month. Zuckerberg's notes warn him, &quot;don't say we already do what GDPR requires.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The notes even refer to Tim Cook, the Apple CEO who recently criticized Facebook. One note says there are &quot;lots of stories about apps misusing Apple data, never seen Apple notify people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of the notes are written in such a style. Under the heading &quot;compensation&quot;, for instance, the notes read &quot;No credit card information or [Social Security numbers] shared&quot; - apparently suggesting that Mr Zuckerberg would reject the idea of paying users caught up in the scandal because they had not lost out monetarily.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another part of the notes reads &quot;breaking up&quot;, which was presumably prepared in casesenators brought up the often suggested move that Facebook should be split up into different companies to stop it being a monopoly. &quot;US tech companies key asset for America; break up strengthens Chinese companies,&quot; the notes read.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Zuckerberg had undergone intense preparation for the two sets of hearings and other meetings on Capitol Hill, which have been called partly in response to the Cambridge Analytica controversy. As well as the detailed notes, he also underwent mock hearings with Facebook staff role playing as the senators asking him questions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook's massive privacy scandal has highlighted the importance of user data protection and privacy.&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now it seems Instagram  is taking some new steps to give users more control over their data on the app.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Facebook -owned social media platform says it will soon allow users to download a copy of all the content they've uploaded on the platform.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That includes data like photos and videos, according to TechCrunch.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scroll down for videos&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until now, Instagram has lacked a data portability tool and users don't have the option of saving their photos after they've already been posted to the app.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's despite Facebook introducing a similar feature, called the Download Your Information tool, in 2010.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We are building a new data portability tool,' an Instagram spokesman said via email.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'You'll soon be able to download a copy of what you've shared on Instagram, including your photos, videos and messages'.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Importantly, the tool lets users control the data they've uploaded to the platform, but not necessarily all the data Instagram has collected on them.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's unclear whether the tool will also let users download lists of users they follow or who follow their account, likes, comments or Stories, TechCrunch said.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thus far, users have been forced to use potentially unsecure or scammy third-party apps to download their data from Instagram, via apps like Instaport.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the tool is launched before May 25, it will help Instagram comply with upcoming European privacy laws that require data portability, TechCrunch noted.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The soon-to-launch General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) laws also require companies to delete user data upon request.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instagram, which has some 800 million users worldwide, did not say when it expects to launch the tool.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook's 'Download Your Information' tool allows users to download everything off their profile, including things like friends lists, events, messages, wall posts and photos, among other things.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's been a helpful tool for users who want to learn more about what information Facebook has collected on them.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also makes it easier for users to move off the platform should they decide to delete their account in favor of using a different social media service.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it's also been somewhat of a wake up call for users who were shocked to learn that the firm was scraping data like call logs and text messages.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the wake of Facebook's privacy scandal, many users and experts have criticized platforms like Instagram, Twitter and Google for being similarly tight-lipped about the amount of data they collect on their users.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some users have said that they would move to using only Instagram after being outraged by Facebook's data collection practices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, many were quick to point out that other top social media platforms, like Instagram and WhatsApp, are both owned by Facebook and, therefor, likely to be just as suspicious when it comes to user data privacy.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A recent study by internet search engine Duck Duck Go found that a majority of Americans don't know that Facebook actually owns Instagram.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A survey of 1,153 US adults showed that 56.9% of them didn't know the social media giant owns Instagram.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg was questioned about this when he testified on Capitol Hill on Tuesday and Wednesday.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zuckerberg answered questions from lawmakers about the firm's massive privacy scandal, which resulted in 87 million users' data being harvested without their knowledge from the platform by Cambridge Analytica, a political consultancy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senators asked Zuckerberg to name some of Facebook's legitimate competitors, to which he said Google, Apple, Amazon and Microsoft.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added that internet users tend to use an upwards of eight different apps on a regular basis.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Critics pointed out, however, that Facebook owns many of those apps, including Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and the core Facebook app.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They may still want to do it on the scale that's taken place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But I feel with my conversations with my friends and with my children in their 20s that there is an awareness which is now settling in of what actually maybe happening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I also think that social media sites like Facebook and other major internet sites like Google have been taking many more steps then they have in the past about engaging with what needs to be done in terms of cleaning up their sites.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She added: &quot;I do think they are waking up to the fact that they do have much more of a responsibility to ensure that the sort of activity that we see, and we all agree is illegal offline, doesn't take place online.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Simon Migliano, head of research atTop10VPN.comtold us that the Cambridge Analytica data breach shows how freely available personal information has become.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As the scandal continues to rumble on, people are increasingly becoming aware of the fact that their own data could well be being used without their knowledge - or their explicit consent,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For those who aren't quite ready to completely delete their social media accounts and apps, there are ways that users can protect themselves without completely erasing their online profile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Taking more care on social media, for example, can reduce your visibility to these companies. Turn off location finding settings, delete any personal info you wouldn't want in the public domain - even if it tells you it's only visible to you - and be wary of using the likes of Facebook to log into third party sites.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's also worth doing a complete audit of app permissions on your mobile devices - does that app need access to the camera? If not, then revoke it. Also be wary of installing apps that ask seemingly unnecessary permissions.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mark Zuckerberg was last night grilled for five hours by US senators, although their questions failed to elicit many new revealing answers about the data controversy that has gripped the company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What did reveal some of Facebook's own thinking, however, was Mark Zuckerberg's crib sheet of notes prepared ahead of the hearing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two sheets of A4, photographed by the Associated Press,&nbsp;reveal some of the key issues Facebook has been responding to, the questions he was ready for, and the questions senators failed to capitalise on.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within the notes, underlined sections included comments that &quot;NO credit card/SSN [social security number] info&quot; was taken, as well as one note on whether Zuckerberg should &quot;Resign?&quot; or have Facebook broken up. One of the most extensive sections included a comeback to Apple chief executive Tim Cook, who has criticised the company's handling of the crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also included some pre-prepared lines and counter arguments that Zuckerberg should give. One comment reads: &quot;If attacked: Respectfully, I reject that&quot;;&nbsp;another says: &quot;Let's be clear: Facebook doesn't sell your data&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also prepared to responses on Facebook as a monopoly, including dropping hints about how China was developing major tech companies and it was important to protect US business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here are some of the key questions Zuckerberg prepared for:</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mark Zuckerberg would like you to know one thing - Facebook messed up. During a rare press conference last week, Zuckerberg was grilled by journalists over Facebook's privacy lapses. His message was consistent: mistakes were made, he takes responsibility and the company has made sweeping changes to better protect user data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We didn't take a broad enough view of what our responsibility is, and that was a huge mistake. It was my mistake,&quot; he said. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While some of the questions were tough, it was merely a dress rehearsal for a much more consequential grilling in Washington DC this week. On Tuesday, Zuckerberg will testify before a joint hearing of the Senate commerce and judiciary committees over data misuse, following revelations that Cambridge Analytica acquired millions of profiles of US citizens and used it to build a software program to predict and influence voters. The next day, Zuckerberg will testify on the same topic before the House energy and commerce committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taking the stand will be a major test for Zuckerberg's communication skills. Unlike when he deals with the media, his public relations team won't be there to cherry-pick questions from friendly parties. And Congress wants its pound of flesh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Congress is theatre. More than what they are going to want to learn [about the data lapses], they are going to want to inflict pain. They are going to want to be seen as being responsive to public disgruntlement with how Facebook handled the issue,&quot; said Ari Ratner, founder of communications consultancy Inside Revolution and former Obama administration official.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adam Hodge, a crisis communications veteran from SKDKnickerbocker, agrees. &quot;I expect members of Congress are going to grill him intensely and if they feel like they aren't getting straight answers they are going to lose their patience pretty quickly,&quot; he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zuckerberg will want to come across as authentic and apologetic, and will, according to his testimony published on Monday, highlight the sweeping changes that the company has announced already to its privacy tools and to the way third parties can access data on the platform as well as a verification process for political advertisers and page administrators. He will probably also want to talk about Facebook's global compliance with General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a broad set of privacy protections being introduced in the European Union in May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He clearly has to deeply, personally apologise and hope he will satisfy and blunt any attempt at US regulation,&quot; said Jeffrey Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy. &quot;He does not want to see strong regulatory oversight.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Zuckerberg will likely continue to blame &quot;bad actors&quot; misusing the platform, it will be difficult to deflect questions about Facebook's core business model of continually tracking and monetising individuals and their relationships.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a long-standing problem, not a bug in the Facebook system. It's a feature,&quot; said Robyn Caplan, a researcher at Data &amp; Society, pointing out that Facebook lured third-party developers by offering them access to user data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The main issue is not whether or not entities have individual data but how that data is being used. How are advertisers or political campaigns using that data to come back onto the Facebook system and seed content to particular users,&quot; she added. &quot;We know very little about how this targeting works.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chester agrees: &quot;People have no idea what is operating behind the Facebook curtain. They don't know about data mining, analytics and digital ad practices,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company is pouring money into its defence, hiring US law firm WilmerHale, led by Reginald Brown, previously a special adviser to President George W Bush, to coach Zuckerberg on the best strategies for handling the heat, according to the New York Times. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time Facebook is bolstering its lobbying capabilities. The company spent almost $12m on lobbying in 2017 and is currently on a &quot;hiring spree&quot; for policy communications specialists. In spite of this investment, Zuckerberg can't expect an easy ride - as the bosses of other companies in industries facing public and political ire have found.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One tactic policymakers might use is to fixate on tiny symbolic details that might tarnish Facebook rather than questions that go to the core of the problem. This happened in 2008 when the CEOs of Ford, Chrysler and General Motors took private jets to Washington to request taxpayer bailout money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They came to discuss the fate of a major industry and Congress hit them on 'why did you fly here?'&quot; said Ratner. &quot;He's going to have to be prepared for that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A few rounds of public humiliation might just be the price Zuckerberg has to pay to appease regulators, provided he is generous with his time and detailed and contrite in his responses. The only real imminent regulatory threat to his company is the Federal Trade Commission's investigation, which could lead to huge fines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Symbolically he's going to be taken to the political woodshed, but will probably be let off without any serious consequences at a federal level,&quot; said Chester.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The country's data watchdog has said that there was no conflict of interest in delivering the keynote speech at a cybersecurity conference organised by Independent News and Media (INM).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Helen Dixon, the data protection commissioner (DPC), spoke at the media company's Dublin Data Sec 2018 event yesterday on the issue of general data protection regulation (GDPR) - the European Union's effort to harmonise privacy laws across Europe. Ms Dixon is investigating an alleged data breach at INM. She said there were &quot;no issues whatsoever&quot; when asked about a possible conflict of interests. She said that she booked to attend the meeting months in advance and received no fee for her appearance because it was &quot;part of the job&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">INM is at the centre of an alleged data breach scandal after the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement (ODCE) applied to the High Court to appoint inspectors to look into the company's affairs. The ODCE has also filed an affidavit with the court that outlines claims relating to the alleged unauthorised access of past and present staff emails. The case will come before the High Court next Monday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In her speech Ms Dixon said it was essential to have clear policies in place for staff regarding the consequences of a breach of GDPR. She identified transparency as a key area in the new EU-wide regulation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Organisations need to know that there will be a way of holding them to account if they do not shoulder responsibility,&quot; Ms Dixon told delegates. &quot;Issues arise when organisations don't think before they act, and don't take the time to implement the legislation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When asked whether or not there was a conflict of interest in attending the INM event, Ms Dixon said: &quot;No issues whatsoever, it's just one of a series of events to promote compliance with GDPR.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new regulations will come into effect on May 25 and will introduce guidelines for the handling of personal data. The main changes centre around right to access, the right to be forgotten, breach notification and data portability. Citizens will be able to request the deletion of any personal data about themselves stored by a private company. Fines will also apply for businesses found not to be complying with GDPR, which can be up to 4 per cent of a company's turnover up to a limit of (EURO)20 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">INM allegedly failed to tell the commissioner last year that the copying of its computer servers under the direction of Leslie Buckley, the company's former chairman, involved the transfer of personal information. The publisher notified the data regulator's office of a potential data breach last August after it emerged that Mr Buckley had authorised a British firm to access the servers without informing the company's board or management. The DPC quickly decided that no data breach had occurred but has now revealed that INM only disclosed that the issue related to the British company not having a contract. The Sunday Times reported that the DPC has sent INM a list of questions that must be answered this week as part of a scoping exercise. This followed a second breach notification from the company on March 26. The DPC is expected to launch a targeted investigation into the newspaper group this month. Mr Buckley has denied any wrongdoing.</SPAN></P>

Aside from cases where it is essential that we know the identity of a holder of an Oyster card - such as when checking customers are entitled for free or discounted travel - there is no requirement for anyone to share their personal details with us.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For all cards, including those Oyster cards where proof of identity is required, we deliberately break the link in our systems between the card and the journeys made with it as soon as that link is no longer required for customer support, such as processing fare refunds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paying&nbsp;to&nbsp;top up an Oyster with a bank credit or debit card, or making a journey with a contactless payment card, does not result in us holding any personal data about that customer, in line with payment industry rules.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All customers have an option to register their personal details with us so that we can provide additional services, such as the ability to view their full personal journey history online. Such details are, of course, essential to ensure that we are only sharing that customer's information. Any personal data given to us is never shared with anyone else, except where disclosures are made under highly prescribed circumstances, largely to law enforcement agencies where it is permitted by law or when the individual has given their consent.</SPAN></P>

However, the GDPR, just like its predecessor, the 1995 European Data Protection Directive, expressly covers the collection of&nbsp;personal information&nbsp;about us. The&nbsp;history of Europe in the 20th century shows the chilling risks inherent in the collection of names - and ethnic identities - on lists. The&nbsp;scope of data&nbsp;protection law is very broad, and&nbsp;for&nbsp;good reason. Jon BainesData protection adviser, Mishcon de Reya LLP </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TESCO will unveil pre-tax profits of more than &pound;1 billion and say that its recovery is firmly on track at its annual results on Wednesday, according to City analysts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GETTY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tesco has generated pre-tax profits of &pound;1.1 billion, says CEO Dave Lewis</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chief executive Dave Lewis is expected to say that Tesco generated pre-tax profits of &pound;1.1 billion for the 12 months to the end of February, compared to just &pound;145 million for the year before, as it continues to put the troubles of the past behind it.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Profits are expected to leap more than six fold because of improved trading, lower debt repayment costs and a sharp reduction in the level of business write-offs that Tesco had to make during the year. Additionally, revenues are tipped to be 3.1 per cent higher at &pound;57.7 billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lewis is also set to bring cheer to the supermarket giant's long-suffering investors, by confirming that it will pay a final dividend of 2p per share, which will cost the firm approximately &pound;195.4 million. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Combined with the 1p interim dividend it declared last October, its first in three years, it brings the total payout to investors for the 2017/18 financial year to approximately &pound;293.1 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related articles  Cheapest supermarket UK: THIS is the best value chain to buy food from  Tesco launches scheme 'bags with barcodes' giving customers discounts </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shore Capital head of research Clive Black said: &quot;Dave Lewis can say confidently that Tesco has left the intensive care unit, it has left the medical ward and can leave the hospital, but it still has some recovering to do. &quot;We're looking for good, solid numbers from the UK business, where it has outperformed its peers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Phil Dorrell, partner at consultant Retail Remedy, said: &quot;Tesco has had a steep climb over the last three-and-a-half years since Lewis took over, but it is on track and it should be happy with its progress.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to data from market research group Kantar Worldpanel, Tesco's share of the grocery market stabilised over the course of the 2017/18 financial year, falling just 0.1 percentage points to 27.9 per cent, despite the ongoing price war waged by its traditional rivals and German discounters Aldi and Lidl.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lewis was parachuted in to Tesco in September 2014 to replace chief executive Philip Clarke, who was ousted after two profit warnings and the discovery of accounting errors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As part of his turnaround plan, Tesco has cut its prices and ranges, closed unprofitable stores, pared back its overseas empire and improved customer service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has also acquired Britain's biggest food wholesaler Booker and investors expect Lewis to update the market as to how the integration is going.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Investors will also be looking for Lewis to provide teasers as to how Tesco will grow its margins.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Dorrell warned that they will never get back to historic levels because of the impact of Aldi and Lidl.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elsewhere, online fashion retail powerhouse Asos is expected to say that its interim pre-tax profits have jumped 54 per cent to &pound;42.1 million on Wednesday, thanks to surging sales in the US, Europe and other overseas markets.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If a picture is worth a thousand words, then a good metaphor must be worth a million. In an insightful blog post published on 23 March, Doc Searls, one of the elder statesman of the web, managed to get both for the price of one. His post was headed by one of those illustrations of an iceberg showing that only the tip is the visible part, while the great bulk of the object lies underwater. In this case, the tip was adorned with the Facebook logo while the submerged mass represented &quot;Every other website making money from tracking-based advertising&quot;. The moral: &quot;Facebook's Cambridge Analytica problems are nothing compared to what's coming for all of online publishing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The proximate cause of Searls's essay was encountering a New York Times op-ed piece entitled Facebook's Surveillance Machine by Zeynep Tufekci. It wasn't the (unexceptional) content of the article that interested Searls, however, but what his ad-blocking software told him about the Times page in which the essay appeared. The software had detected no fewer than 13 hidden trackers on the page. (I've just checked and my Ghostery plug-in has detected 19.)</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In our current online world, only the paranoid thrive</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the point of this? The NYT is just doing what every other publication that lives off &quot;adtech&quot; does: tracker-based advertising. These publications, Searls wrote, &quot;don't just open the kimonos of their readers. They bring readers' bare digital necks to vampires ravenous for the blood of personal data, all for the purpose of aiming 'interest-based' advertising at those same&nbsp;readers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is what security guru Bruce Schneier meant when he observed that &quot;surveillance is the business model of the internet&quot;. (Pedantic columnists - like this one - might object that he meant the web rather than the internet, but since many people cannot distinguish between the two, we'll let that pass.) The fundamental truth highlighted by Schneier's aphorism is that the vast majority of internet users have entered into a Faustian bargain in which they exchange control of their personal data in return for &quot;free&quot; services (such as social networking and search) and/or easy access to the websites of online publications, YouTube and the like.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The big question for those of us who study this stuff is whether internet users really appreciate the nature of that pact. And if they don't, what would it take to alert them to it? At the moment, the omens don't look too promising. The huge fuss caused by the Cambridge Analytica revelations, for example, has generated a predictable #deletefacebook frenzy in liberal echo-chambers, but outside of those it's not clear that everyday Facebook users are much affected by the&nbsp;controversy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  A radical proposal to keep your personal data safe | Richard Stallman</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Granted, recent opinion polls cast doubt over the level of trust people have in Facebook over privacy, despite advertisements the firm ran in British and US newspapers apologising to users. But I doubt that that scepticism will translate into people actually boycotting Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram and Messenger. And although the company's share price has tumbled, investment analysts are still unsure about whether this is a temporary blip or a real crisis. It might just turn out to be like the VW &quot;Dieselgate&quot; fiasco, in which the share price plummeted but eventually stabilised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Big though Facebook is, however, it's only the tip of the web iceberg. And it's there that change will have to come if the data vampires are to be vanquished. The good news is that we already have some useful tools available - most of them free - to every internet user; and some potentially heavy artillery is arriving in May. On the tools front, there are browser plug-ins such as Disconnect Private Browsing, Privacy Badger and Ghostery. Installing any one of these tends to administer a salutary shock, because they instantly reveal (and enable you to block) the startling number of snoopers who are covertly tracking your online activity. And anyone who uses public wifi in cafes, airports and other places really ought to fork out for some VPN (Virtual Private Network) software to protect them from tracking and preserve their anonymity. In our current online world, only the paranoid thrive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The heavy weaponry is the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which becomes law in May. It says that people must be able to easily learn who has their personal data, and what they are doing with it. And it mandates that people must have confidence that no other parties receive these data. If it's rigorously enforced (which could be a big &quot;if&quot; unless data protection authorities are properly resourced) it could blow a massive hole in the covert ad-tracking racket - and oblige us to find less abusive and dysfunctional business models to support our online addiction. So let's resolve not to allow the&nbsp;coming&nbsp;crisis to go to&nbsp;waste.</SPAN></P>

The photons that hit Hubble's image sensor left Icarus 9bn years ago, which means we're looking at it as it was when the universe was a third of its current age. There's a wonderful account by Katyanna Quach in the Register of why we're able to see it now.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The messages are part of a new EU law on data protection and privacy, which comes into force on May 25.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What are the rules? The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) covers all organisations that handle data, from multinationals to small firms, schools, charities and NHS trusts. It applies in all EU states and will continue to be law in the UK after Brexit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Organisations will not be allowed to collect and use personal information without the individual's consent. Also, they must report data breaches to the authorities within 72 hours. If they break the rules, they face fines of up to 4% of global turnover or (EURO)20m (currently &pound;17.5m), whichever is higher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What does it mean for me? You will be able to ask an organisation for a copy of all the data it holds on you, which must be provided within 30 days. Also, you will be able to insist that Facebook delete your profile or Google erase information in its cloud.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If organisations have previously sought consent to collect your data, the records may not meet GDPR standards, and they will have to ask again.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cambridge Analytica and Facebook may have grabbed headlines over how our personal information is harvested and used, but a much bigger data revolution is coming soon, and it will affect us all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) takes effect on May 25. It gives all consumers new rights to access information held about them, makes it mandatory for businesses to manage data securely, and has stiff fines for those who don't fall into line.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Applying to all public and private firms - not just estate agents and developers - it means more rights for buyers, sellers, tenants and landlords.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The core principles are that personal data should be used only for the purpose intended, with exceptions only with explicit consent. So, for example, an estate agent sponsoring a school fete must not use details held by the organisers as the basis for a mailing list for advertising homes for sale - unless individuals have explicitly agreed their information may be used for marketing, too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At the rougher end of estate agency there's a lot of cold-calling, leaflets dropped through doors and wild behaviour - a bit like some 'no win, no fee' lawyers. Some of that will have to stop,&quot; says Alex Newall, managing director of Barnes Private Office, a property advisory service working with high networth individuals. Here's what the new data laws may mean for you.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What data is currently held? Estate agents have basic information on sellers and buyers such as phone numbers, email and home addresses, ages and communication preferences. As part of separate antimoney-laundering rules, some agents also hold proof of a buyer's ability to pay for high-value property. Letting agents have even more information, including bank details, proof of immigration status and creditworthiness, and referees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, like any other online activity, browsing property sites may leave a data trail. Some agents gather a wealth of &quot;under the radar&quot; information via cookies and other technology - for example, which types of houses you look at, how long you spend on a website and what links you click on. Under GDPR, online identifiers such as a computer IP address will now count as personal data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How safe is this data? &quot;Consumers should check the 'privacy policy' on agency websites, where they explain how they handle your data, and how you opt in or out of future communications,&quot; says Michael Day, who runs Integra Property Services, a consultancy that has been training agents on GDPR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, some agents are starting from a low level of data security. Two years ago the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) - the watchdog that will preside over the new regulation - rebuked agents in a report, accusing the industry of undertaking too little formal training in data protection. Customers were often not being told how information would be stored and used, it warned, and there was a lack of awareness about security systems such as encryption.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;More than 500,000 people work in real estate in the UK. That's a lot of people handling a lot of personal data. It's an important responsibility to get that right, and our report suggests there's room for improvement in a lot of sales and lettings agents,&quot; the ICO concluded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How long can agents keep my details? Article 5 of GDPR states data must be kept &quot;no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed&quot;. The vagueness of this may give rise to disputes - if you register as a buyer with an agent, how long can you legitimately continue to receive property details? Agents will vary in their approach to GDPR but it is likely that when you register to sell, buy, let or rent a home you will have separate paperwork setting out how your data will be stored and used, and asking you to opt in or out to allowing its use for future marketing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Can I get this data removed? Under Article 17 of GDPR individuals have the right to have personal data erased under &quot;the right to be forgotten&quot;. In most cases this has to be done by the agent without question, but there are exceptions. &quot;For example, if an agent has a legal obligation to keep financial records for a stipulated period in line with anti-moneylaundering law, such data is not going to be deleted before that legal obligation expires,&quot; Day says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Can agents still cold-call and send me mailshots? Mass leaflet drops across a whole neighbourhood or postcode are likely to continue - they don't use personal data. But highly specific mailshots - for example, communications trying to poach you away from an agency that you are already using to sell your home - may be against GDPR. More generally, if you've recently dealt with an agent and were given the chance to opt out of such marketing but chose not to, the business is entitled to continue sending material to you.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What's the penalty if the law is broken? The current ICO fine for a data breach cannot exceed &pound;500,000, but from May 25 organisations face penalties of up to 2% of their annual turnover or (EURO)10m, whichever is higher, if they breach the GDPR code of conduct. For infringements relating to an individual's personal data, that rises to 4% of turnover or (EURO)20m, whichever is higher. However, these penalties are only for the most extreme cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some agents gather a wealth of 'under the radar' data - the type of houses you look at and links you click on</SPAN></P>

All businesses must comply or risk the consequences. But will non-compliance with the new rulings spell DISASTER for Britain's businesses?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GDPR, or General Data Protection Regulation, requires all businesses to protect and properly manage all customer privacy data.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The EU regulations, coming into effect May 25, 2018, are designed to revolutionise the way public data is handled by big companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ruling states that businesses must make all efforts to protect and securely manage all private and personal data of any EU citizen or customer that they hold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rulings were put in place in response to a sustained spate of major hacks stealing millions of user data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In these cases, the businesses are at fault for not securely protecting data, putting every customer at risk of having their data stolen and used against them.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a bid to set a higher bar for consumer rights and security, businesses will now be required to comply with a strict set of rules by the cut-off date.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new rules will take over a dated EU regulation formed in 1995, to keep up with modern technology and data gathering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new rules will be consistent across all 28 EU states, but the bar is set to a very high standard, with businesses having to make significant investments&nbsp;into&nbsp;their business to comply.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Non-compliance could be fatal to most businesses, so getting clued up on rules is vital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Any breach of data from a company will immediately&nbsp;incurs&nbsp;fine of up to &pound;23.6 million or 4 percent of the total worldwide annual turnover,&nbsp;whichever&nbsp;is higher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No number to be sniffed at.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Businesses now need to keep customer data under lock and key</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's some debate about whether high fines will be levied, and in what circumstances, but it's possible that some data regulators will want to send a clear message by making an example of a company for non-compliance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apparently, the European Data Protection Board will offer guidance on fines, but that guidance is not yet available and the first few cases are liable to set a precedent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most UK businesses will have invested more than &pound;1million in making sure they are fully compliant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tamzin Evershed is head of legal at Veritas Technologies, understands that, while many businesses are aware of GDPR, they don't know the consequences of non-compliance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an exclusive interview with&nbsp;Express.co.uk, Tamzin said: &quot;One of the key challenges that many companies are facing is the complexities around effectively managing their data regardless of where it sits in their&nbsp;organisation. Companies need to have complete visibility into data, including what information is stored, how it is used, who owns it and who accesses it.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GETTY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GDPR comes into effect May 25</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They also need to have the ability to search through large volumes of digital data so that it can be accessed quickly to respond to requests from individuals to access, erase, or restrict personal data in a timely manner, in line with GDPR requirements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Aside from technology, businesses must also&nbsp;instill&nbsp;a culture of digital compliance and responsibility among employees. Our research found that many businesses are putting in place new processes and policies including training, rewards and updated contracts in support of GDPR compliance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As a result, employees will understand the role they play in protecting their&nbsp;organisation's&nbsp;data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If businesses focus on implementing the right technologies and processes to better manage their data, the potential business benefits are huge. Those that achieve GDPR compliance expect to benefit from improved customer relationships, a stronger reputation, and&nbsp;improved revenues.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     But what about Brexit?                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unfortunately, Brexit will not make any difference when it comes to GDPR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our membership in the EU, or soon to be exclusion, is not going to impact the rule changes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GETTY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consumers are now more aware of their own protection rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dave Rogers, security product specialist at King of Servers, Told the Express.co.uk: &quot;The UK government has supported the legislation since it was initially read in the European Parliament, and it has already indicated that when the Brexit process is complete it will essentially, 'copy and paste' any EU law the UK is subject to into UK law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some commentators have suggested that perhaps when parliament is able to legislate without interference from Brussels, GDPR will be repealed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;However, we think this is quite unlikely. As it stands, the EU is one of the UK's biggest trading partners, and in order to continue doing business with countries inside the EU, the UK will need to ensure its own data protection laws match GDPR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Failure to do so may impact Britain's ability to do business with countries in the EU.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Richard Potter, CEO of Data science and AI company, Peak, sees this as an opportunity for businesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Potter spoke to the Express.co.uk and said: &quot;GDPR presents businesses with a great opportunity to get organised and uncover some of the potential that is currently locked inside their data. Businesses will have to take the required measures to locate, identify and organise their data, keeping only the bits that are useful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So, if you're keeping it, why? And what can you do with it? Brands will be able to gain greater insights from a more streamlined and relevant database, allowing them to make better business decisions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In terms of risks involved, the hefty fines speak for themselves; up to (EURO)20 million or 4 percent of global revenue, whichever is greater.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Can I tell you about something that can get those dodgy pictures off the internet for you at the same time as wiping the self-satisfied smile off Mark Zuckerberg's face? That's a slightly dishonest way of introducing the topic of a vast piece of EU legislation, but I thought that if I kicked off with some of the more recondite clauses from the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) you would do what I would under the circumstances, which is to put the newspaper down and wander out into the garden with the dog, wondering vaguely whether spring is ever going to do its usual magic on the muddy battlefield over which the neighbourhood foxes have been waging gang warfare all winter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Give me a couple of minutes, though, for the GDPR deserves your attention: it may make the future a little less grim than it sometimes threatens to be.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new rules, which come into force next month, require companies to be much more careful and upfront about what they do with our data. They would have prevented Cambridge Analytica from gaining access to the data of 87million Facebook users without their www.consent.No longer will companies be able to rely on pre-ticked boxes to gain our permission to email us whenever they like, or sell on information about us. They will have to be much hotter on issues such as security breaches. They will be responsible for enforcing the &quot;right to be forgotten&quot; - deleting both the embarrassing stuff we have put out there at incautious moments and the mendacious stuff other people have put out there about us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fines for breaches of the new regulations are eye-watering. Right now, the maximum fine in Britain for breaking the existing law is &pound;500,000. Under the GDPR that will go up to (EURO)20 million (&pound;17.5 million) or 4 per cent of last year's revenues, whichever is higher. The Information Commissioner's Office, which implements data-protection rules, will get more powers. Under the existing rules, it had to wait four days for a warrant to search Cambridge Analytica's office, while employees reportedly carted plastic boxes off the premises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The risk of breaking the rules inadvertently seems high, for they are 88 pages long and of baffling complexity. All over the country, lawyers are toasting each other in magnums of Ch&acirc;teau d'Yquem paid for by the countless hours they have spent poring over this legislation with their clients. And it's not just big fat companies whose profit margins can absorb these costs that have to deal with this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A friend with a tiny art business has been warned that she may be in breach of the regulations if she doesn't contact everybody on her mailing list to check that they really want to be on it. If everybody's inboxes are overflowing with similar emails most of them will drop off, in which case she will not have a business. She's not sure what to do, so she's going to consult a lawyer. More foie gras, waiter!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The regulations will push up the cost of doing business, and companies will pass those costs on to consumers. When you think about how much we get on the internet free - videos, music, stories, maps, and all the knowledge in the world - that's not an insignificant issue. And regulations raise the cost of doing business and so make it harder for entrepreneurs to thrive, thus slowing the pace of innovation and entrenching the power of big companies, those whose misuse of our data is the reason we're all in a stew about the subject right now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And yet I think we probably need this great regulatory juggernaut, or something like it at least. If my behaviour is anything to go by, consumers are too feckless or ignorant to keep an eye on what the companies that live off their data are doing with it. I neither know nor care which of my secrets they are selling to whom until some scandal makes me pay attention. I agree to everything, and then get outraged when it's too late.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a society, we therefore have a choice: we can either allow companies to do pretty much whatever they want, and thus gain more and more knowledge about us and power over us, or we can assign to our government the duty to keep those companies in check.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">America, whose constitutional protection for freedom of speech limits the scope for data-protection laws, is taking the former route, Europe the latter. Hence the GDPR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In most spheres of life, I would be horrified by a piece of regulation bound to gum up the wheels of commerce as soundly as this one undoubtedly will. But in the tech sector, I'm not that bothered. Although I regret the fact that it will give big companies an advantage over small ones, I can deal with the idea that the pace of innovation may slow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Humankind is not built to cope with very rapid change and, at the risk of sounding as though I were 103, the rate at which technology has revolutionised our lives over the past couple of decades has been a little speedy for me. I could do with a bit of stasis before our next alarming lurch into whatever fresh hell artificial intelligence is planning for us.</SPAN></P>

<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It follows the shocking revelation Wednesday that&nbsp;Facebook's misuse of personal information was far worse than initially thought&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has backtracked on his company's position regarding strong European Union data privacy protections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a press call on Tuesday the 33-year-old refused to divulge whether Facebook would spread the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) privacy safeguards, which come into effect in Europe next month, to users worldwide.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But following the shocking revelation that&nbsp;the firm shared the data of up to 87 million users with the political consultancy firm Cambridge Analytica - a dramatic increase from initial media estimates of 50 million - Zuckerberg has changed his tune.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Overall I think regulations like this are very positive. We intend to make all the same controls available everywhere, not just in Europe,' he told reporters yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scroll down for video&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zuckerberg continued: 'Is it going to be exactly the same format? Probably not. We'll need to figure out what makes sense in different markets with different laws in different places.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'But let me repeat this, we're going to make all the same controls and settings available everywhere, not just in Europe.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The comments are in stark contrast to those the billionaire made to Reuters earlier this week, in which he said he agreed 'in spirit' with GDPR, but stopped short of&nbsp;committing to it as the standard for the social network across the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zuckerberg told Reuters &nbsp;in a phone interview that Facebook was working on a version of the law that would work globally, bringing some EU guarantees worldwide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the 33-year-old billionaire demurred when asked what parts of the law he would not extend worldwide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We're still nailing down details on this, but it should directionally be, in spirit, the whole thing,' Zuckerberg said. He did not elaborate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The European GDPR law aims to strengthen and unify data protection for all individuals within the European Union and will enter into force on May 25.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It will give Europeans the right to know what data is stored on them and the right to have it deleted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apple and some other tech firms have said they do plan to give people in the United States and elsewhere the same protections and rights that Europeans will gain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Facebook spokesperson said that legislation in some countries&nbsp;conflicts with GDPR's rules, meaning the changes cannot be extended everywhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The scandal-hit firm is still reeling over the Cambridge Analytica revelations, which led to allegations of mishandling of personal data belonging to millions of its users.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This information was used to target voters in the US, based on psychological profiling, with political adverts spreading disinformation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Wednesday, Facebook Chief Technology Office Mike Schroepfer revealed the firm shared data of up to 87 million users with Cambridge Analytica.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The number is a huge jump from initial media estimates of 50 million made when the news broke last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schroepfer shared the new figures in a blog post outlining nine changes the firm is making to the platform in light of the massive data scandal that unfolded last month.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the CTO, most of the affected users were in the United States.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the post, the Facebook exec also revealed the troubling ease with which 'malicious actors' could 'scrape' public information from most users' profiles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg addressed the growing scandal in a media call on Wednesday afternoon, admitting the firm 'didn't do enough' to protect user data or to prevent the spread of disinformation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a call with reporters, Zuckerberg admitted the firm made a 'huge mistake' in failing to take a broad enough view of what Facebook's responsibility is in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'It's my mistake,' the Facebook CEO added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Referring to the Cambridge Analytica scandal, he said that it isn't enough for Facebook to believe app developers when they say they follow the rules.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said Facebook has to ensure they do.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Life is learning from mistakes,' Zuckerberg told reporters, according  to CNET.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'At the end of the day, this is my responsibility. I started this place, I run it, I'm responsible.'&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We know now we didn't do enough to focus on preventing abuse and thinking through how people use these tools to do harm,' the Facebook CEO added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, as the company looks forward, Zuckerberg said the firm must address Facebook's role in democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'It's not enough to give people a voice, we have to make sure that people are not using that voice to spread disinformation,' Zuckerberg said, according to CNET.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Facebook grapples with the unfolding data scandal, more and more worrying details continue to emerge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest indicates the issue, which Zuckerberg himself called a 'breach of trust,' affected many more users than initially suspected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'In total, we believe the Facebook information of up to 87 million people - mostly in the US - may have been improperly shared with Cambridge Analytica,'&nbsp;Schroepfer said on Wednesday.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the blog post, Schroepfer shed light on additional ways 'malicious actors' could access users' data without their knowledge, by scraping public information from profiles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The site previously allowed users to enter someone's phone number or email address into the search bar to locate that person.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the tool was helpful for finding friends in some scenarios, for example, in languages which 'take more effort to type out a full name,' the firm says it was also regularly abused.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result, Facebook is now doing away with it entirely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Given the scale and sophistication of the activity we've seen, we believe most people on Facebook could have had their public profile scraped in this way,' Schroepfer wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'So we have now disabled this feature.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We're also making changes to account recovery to reduce the risk of scraping as well.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The troubling revelation came in the midst of new details on what Schroepfer says are the nine 'most important changes' the firm is making to the site.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And, the CTO notes, more are set to come over the next few months.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The current changes also include new guidelines for the controversial opt-in feature that allowed Facebook to collect call and text history from Android users.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We've reviewed this feature to confirm that Facebook does not collect the content of messages - and will delete all logs older than one year,' Schroepfer wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'In the future, the client will only upload to our servers the information needed to offer this feature - not broader data such as the time of calls.'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The firm is also rolling out a new tool to more prominently display the apps and websites you use.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A link for this will appear at the top of the News Feed starting Monday April 9. Clicking this link will reveal what information you share with these apps, and give the option to remove them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The changes also include new permissions requirements for Groups, Pages, and Events.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As of today, apps using these APIs will no longer be able to access guest or member lists. For events, apps will also be unable to access posts on the event wall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The firm also says it is rolling out strict requirements for apps seeking approval through the Events API, and will require approval for all apps seeking access to the Pages API.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For groups, Schroepfer wrote, 'we're also removing personal information, such as names and profile photos, attached to posts or comments that approved apps can access.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The firm also says it will no longer allow apps to ask for more detailed personal information, such as religious or political views, entertainment activity, relationship status, or news reading.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The changes follow several others that have rolled out in the last few weeks in light of the Cambridge Analytica scandal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Overall, we believe these changes will better protect people's information while still enabling developers to create useful experiences,' Schroepfer wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We know we have more work to do - and we'll keep you updated as we make more changes.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Privacy advocacy groups have been urging Facebook and its Silicon Valley competitors such as Alphabet Inc's Google to apply EU data laws worldwide, largely without success.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Google and Facebook are the global leaders in internet ad revenue. Both based in California, they possess enormous amounts of data on billions of people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Google has declined to comment on its plans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When GDPR takes effect on May 25, people in EU countries will gain the right to transfer their data to other social networks, for example.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook and its competitors will also need to be much more specific about how they plan to use people's data, and they will need to get explicit consent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GDPR is likely to hurt profit at Facebook because it could reduce the value of ads if the company cannot use personal information as freely and the added expense of hiring lawyers to ensure compliance with the new law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Data is central to Facebook's advertising business, and it has not yet sketched out a satisfying plan for how it plans to comply, said Pivotal Research analyst Brian Wieser.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I haven't heard any solutions from Facebook to get ahead of the problem yet,' Wieser said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Failure to comply with the law carries a maximum penalty of up to 4 percent of annual revenue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It should not be difficult for companies to extend EU practices and policies elsewhere because they already have systems in place, said Nicole Ozer, director of technology and civil liberties at the American Civil Liberties Union of California.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Companies' promises are less reassuring than laws, she said: 'If user privacy is going to be properly protected, the law has to require it.'</SPAN></P>

<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It follows the shocking revelation Wednesday that&nbsp;Facebook's misuse of personal information was far worse than initially thought&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has backtracked on his company's position regarding strong European Union data privacy protections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a press call on Tuesday the 33-year-old refused to divulge whether Facebook  would spread the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) privacy safeguards, which come into effect in Europe next month, to users worldwide.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But following the shocking revelation that&nbsp;the firm shared the data of up to 87 million users with the political consultancy firm Cambridge Analytica - a dramatic increase from initial media estimates of 50 million - Zuckerberg has changed his tune.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Overall I think regulations like this are very positive. We intend to make all the same controls available everywhere, not just in Europe,' he told reporters yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scroll down for video&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zuckerberg continued: 'Is it going to be exactly the same format? Probably not. We'll need to figure out what makes sense in different markets with different laws in different places.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'But let me repeat this, we're going to make all the same controls and settings available everywhere, not just in Europe.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The comments are in stark contrast to those the billionaire made to Reuters earlier this week, in which he said he agreed 'in spirit' with GDPR, but stopped short of&nbsp;committing to it as the standard for the social network across the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zuckerberg told Reuters &nbsp;in a phone interview that Facebook was working on a version of the law that would work globally, bringing some EU guarantees worldwide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the 33-year-old billionaire demurred when asked what parts of the law he would not extend worldwide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We're still nailing down details on this, but it should directionally be, in spirit, the whole thing,' Zuckerberg said. He did not elaborate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The European GDPR law aims to strengthen and unify data protection for all individuals within the European Union and will enter into force on May 25.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It will give Europeans the right to know what data is stored on them and the right to have it deleted.</SPAN></P>

<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It follows the shocking revelation Wednesday that&nbsp;Facebook's misuse of personal information was far worse than initially thought&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has backtracked on his company's position regarding strong European Union data privacy protections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a press call on Tuesday the 33-year-old refused to divulge whether Facebook  would spread the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) privacy safeguards, which come into effect in Europe next month, to users worldwide.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But following the shocking revelation that&nbsp;the firm shared the data of up to 87 million users with the political consultancy firm Cambridge Analytica - a dramatic increase from initial media estimates of 50 million - Zuckerberg has changed his tune.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Overall I think regulations like this are very positive. We intend to make all the same controls available everywhere, not just in Europe,' he told reporters yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scroll down for video&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zuckerberg continued: 'Is it going to be exactly the same format? Probably not. We'll need to figure out what makes sense in different markets with different laws in different places.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'But let me repeat this, we're going to make all the same controls and settings available everywhere, not just in Europe.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The comments are in stark contrast to those the billionaire made to Reuters earlier this week, in which he said he agreed 'in spirit' with GDPR, but stopped short of&nbsp;committing to it as the standard for the social network across the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zuckerberg told Reuters &nbsp;in a phone interview that Facebook was working on a version of the law that would work globally, bringing some EU guarantees worldwide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the 33-year-old billionaire demurred when asked what parts of the law he would not extend worldwide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We're still nailing down details on this, but it should directionally be, in spirit, the whole thing,' Zuckerberg said. He did not elaborate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The European GDPR law aims to strengthen and unify data protection for all individuals within the European Union and will enter into force on May 25.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It will give Europeans the right to know what data is stored on them and the right to have it deleted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apple and some other tech firms have said they do plan to give people in the United States and elsewhere the same protections and rights that Europeans will gain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Facebook spokesperson said that legislation in some countries&nbsp;conflicts with GDPR's rules, meaning the changes cannot be extended everywhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The scandal-hit firm is still reeling over the Cambridge Analytica revelations, which led to allegations of mishandling of personal data belonging to millions of its users.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This information was used to target voters in the US, based on psychological profiling, with political adverts spreading disinformation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Wednesday, Facebook Chief Technology Office Mike Schroepfer revealed the firm shared data of up to 87 million users with Cambridge Analytica.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The number is a huge jump from initial media estimates of 50 million made when the news broke last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schroepfer shared the new figures in a blog post outlining nine changes the firm is making to the platform in light of the massive data scandal that unfolded last month.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the CTO, most of the affected users were in the United States.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the post, the Facebook exec also revealed the troubling ease with which 'malicious actors' could 'scrape' public information from most users' profiles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg addressed the growing scandal in a media call on Wednesday afternoon, admitting the firm 'didn't do enough' to protect user data or to prevent the spread of disinformation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a call with reporters, Zuckerberg admitted the firm made a 'huge mistake' in failing to take a broad enough view of what Facebook's responsibility is in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'It's my mistake,' the Facebook CEO added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Referring to the Cambridge Analytica scandal, he said that it isn't enough for Facebook to believe app developers when they say they follow the rules.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said Facebook has to ensure they do.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Life is learning from mistakes,' Zuckerberg told reporters, according  to CNET.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'At the end of the day, this is my responsibility. I started this place, I run it, I'm responsible.'&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We know now we didn't do enough to focus on preventing abuse and thinking through how people use these tools to do harm,' the Facebook CEO added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, as the company looks forward, Zuckerberg said the firm must address Facebook's role in democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'It's not enough to give people a voice, we have to make sure that people are not using that voice to spread disinformation,' Zuckerberg said, according to CNET.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Facebook grapples with the unfolding data scandal, more and more worrying details continue to emerge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest indicates the issue, which Zuckerberg himself called a 'breach of trust,' affected many more users than initially suspected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'In total, we believe the Facebook information of up to 87 million people - mostly in the US - may have been improperly shared with Cambridge Analytica,'&nbsp;Schroepfer said on Wednesday.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the blog post, Schroepfer shed light on additional ways 'malicious actors' could access users' data without their knowledge, by scraping public information from profiles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The site previously allowed users to enter someone's phone number or email address into the search bar to locate that person.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the tool was helpful for finding friends in some scenarios, for example, in languages which 'take more effort to type out a full name,' the firm says it was also regularly abused.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result, Facebook is now doing away with it entirely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Given the scale and sophistication of the activity we've seen, we believe most people on Facebook could have had their public profile scraped in this way,' Schroepfer wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'So we have now disabled this feature.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We're also making changes to account recovery to reduce the risk of scraping as well.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The troubling revelation came in the midst of new details on what Schroepfer says are the nine 'most important changes' the firm is making to the site.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And, the CTO notes, more are set to come over the next few months.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The current changes also include new guidelines for the controversial opt-in feature that allowed Facebook to collect call and text history from Android users.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We've reviewed this feature to confirm that Facebook does not collect the content of messages - and will delete all logs older than one year,' Schroepfer wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'In the future, the client will only upload to our servers the information needed to offer this feature - not broader data such as the time of calls.'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The firm is also rolling out a new tool to more prominently display the apps and websites you use.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A link for this will appear at the top of the News Feed starting Monday April 9. Clicking this link will reveal what information you share with these apps, and give the option to remove them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The changes also include new permissions requirements for Groups, Pages, and Events.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As of today, apps using these APIs will no longer be able to access guest or member lists. For events, apps will also be unable to access posts on the event wall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The firm also says it is rolling out strict requirements for apps seeking approval through the Events API, and will require approval for all apps seeking access to the Pages API.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For groups, Schroepfer wrote, 'we're also removing personal information, such as names and profile photos, attached to posts or comments that approved apps can access.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The firm also says it will no longer allow apps to ask for more detailed personal information, such as religious or political views, entertainment activity, relationship status, or news reading.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The changes follow several others that have rolled out in the last few weeks in light of the Cambridge Analytica scandal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Overall, we believe these changes will better protect people's information while still enabling developers to create useful experiences,' Schroepfer wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We know we have more work to do - and we'll keep you updated as we make more changes.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Privacy advocacy groups have been urging Facebook and its Silicon Valley competitors such as Alphabet Inc's Google to apply EU data laws worldwide, largely without success.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Google and Facebook are the global leaders in internet ad revenue. Both based in California, they possess enormous amounts of data on billions of people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Google has declined to comment on its plans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When GDPR takes effect on May 25, people in EU countries will gain the right to transfer their data to other social networks, for example.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook and its competitors will also need to be much more specific about how they plan to use people's data, and they will need to get explicit consent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GDPR is likely to hurt profit at Facebook because it could reduce the value of ads if the company cannot use personal information as freely and the added expense of hiring lawyers to ensure compliance with the new law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Data is central to Facebook's advertising business, and it has not yet sketched out a satisfying plan for how it plans to comply, said Pivotal Research analyst Brian Wieser.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I haven't heard any solutions from Facebook to get ahead of the problem yet,' Wieser said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Failure to comply with the law carries a maximum penalty of up to 4 percent of annual revenue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It should not be difficult for companies to extend EU practices and policies elsewhere because they already have systems in place, said Nicole Ozer, director of technology and civil liberties at the American Civil Liberties Union of California.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Companies' promises are less reassuring than laws, she said: 'If user privacy is going to be properly protected, the law has to require it.'</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook is rolling out stronger privacy protections to users ahead of the introduction of Europe's General Data Protection Regulation  (GDPR), but Mark Zuckerberg will not promise all future changes will apply to the company's American users.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the initial tranche of changes, announced last week, will be available worldwide, Zuckerberg refused to commit to GDPR becoming the standard for the social network across the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told Reuters that Facebook was working on a version of the data protection law that would work globally, bringing some European privacy guarantees worldwide, but the 33-year-old billionaire demurred when asked what parts of the law he would not extend worldwide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're still nailing down details on this, but it should directionally be, in spirit, the whole thing,&quot; Zuckerberg said. He did not elaborate. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His comments suggest that in some ways, American users will continue to find themselves with weaker privacy protections than their European counterparts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Privacy advocacy groups have been urging Facebook and its Silicon Valley competitors such as Alphabet Inc's Google to apply EU data laws worldwide, largely without success. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We want Facebook and Google and all the other companies to immediately adopt in the United States and worldwide any new protections that they implement in Europe,&quot; said Jeff Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, in Washington. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zuckerberg has agreed to testify in front of Congress, the first of several such hearings he is expected to appear before, on Wednesday 11 April. Representatives Greg Walden and Frank Pallone, the ranking members of the House Energy and Commerce committee, said the hearing will focus on the Facebook's &quot;use and protection of user data&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even while Facebook introduces its long-planned tweaks to comply with GDPR, the social network is also rushing to introduce a second set of privacy tools following the Cambridge Analytica files, which revealed the company's historical lack of clarity over how and why user data was shared with third parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest post-scandal change offers users the ability to remove applications from the Facebook platform in bulk quantities. Integrations with external developers were responsible for the initial removal of data from Facebook's platform that eventually found its way into the hands of Cambridge Analytica, an election consultancy. But it has always been hard for users to manage the settings related to how much data gets shared with external providers, particularly if those users have been on the site for many years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, alongside a tool that was previously promised, which deactivates an app if the user hasn't accessed it in three months, Facebook allows users to remove apps in large numbers, making it easier to clean up their privacy settings. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new settings can be accessed by visiting the main settings, then clicking on &quot;apps&quot;, and checking multiple apps that should be removed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Europe's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) will force the social network to comply with strict rules about the privacyof its European users. ButMr Zuckerberg failed to commit to rolling out the protections globally.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're still nailing down details on this, but it should directionally be, in spirit, the whole thing,&quot; Mr Zuckerberg saidon Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With only 17 per cent of its 2.2 billion users residing within Europe, the vast majority of Facebook's users will not benefit from the new rules.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook has faced pressure in recent weeks to better protect its users' data following revelations that the data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica harvested personal information from more than 50 million Facebook accounts in the build up to the 2016 US elections.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday, New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer called for Mr Zuckerberg to resign from his role as chairman of Facebook, adding that data privacy issues represented &quot;a risk to our democracy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new data protection law -set to come into effect on May 25 - will give people more control over how companies store and use their personal data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Privacy advocates argue that Facebook is doing only what is legally required of them and needs to do more to address issues relating to the Cambridge Analytica scandal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It would be missing some of the larger picture to interpret this as a completely voluntary, privacy-protective measure taken wholly in response to Cambridge Analytica,&quot; Jamie Williams and Gennie Gebhart from the Electronic Frontier Foundation said in a blogpost on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If Facebook wants to demonstrate that it cares beyond legal compliance, it needs to make far broader changes.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Journalists have been asking me whether the revulsion against the abuse of Facebook data could be a turning point for the campaign to recover privacy. That could happen, if the public makes its campaign broader and deeper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Broader, meaning extending to all surveillance systems, not just Facebook. Deeper, meaning to advance from regulating the use of data to regulating the accumulation of data. Because surveillance is so pervasive, restoring privacy is necessarily a big change, and requires powerful measures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  After the Facebook scandal it's time to base the digital economy on public v private ownership of data</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The surveillance imposed on us today far exceeds that of the Soviet Union. For freedom and democracy's sake, we need to eliminate most of it. There are so many ways to use data to hurt people that the only safe database is the one that was never collected. Thus, instead of the EU's approach of mainly regulating how personal data may be used (in its General Data Protection Regulation or GDPR), I propose a law to stop systems from collecting personal data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The robust way to do that, the way that can't be set aside at the whim of a government, is to require systems to be built so as not to collect data about a person. The basic principle is that a system must be designed not to collect certain data, if its basic function can be carried out without that data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Data about who travels where is particularly sensitive, because it is an ideal basis for repressing any chosen target. We can take the London trains and buses as a case for study.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Transport for London digital payment card system centrally records the trips any given Oyster or bank card has paid for. When a passenger feeds the card digitally, the system associates the card with the passenger's identity. This adds up to complete surveillance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I expect the transport system can justify this practice under the GDPR's rules. My proposal, by contrast, would require the system to stop tracking who goes where. The card's basic function is to pay for transport. That can be done without centralising that data, so the transport system would have to stop doing so. When it accepts digital payments, it should do so through an anonymous payment system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Frills on the system, such as the feature of letting a passenger review the list of past journeys, are not part of the basic function, so they can't justify incorporating any additional surveillance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These additional services could be offered separately to users who request them. Even better, users could use their own personal systems to privately track their own journeys.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Black cabs demonstrate that a system for hiring cars with drivers does not need to identify passengers. Therefore such systems should not be allowed  to identify passengers; they should be required to accept privacy-respecting cash from passengers without ever trying to identify them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, convenient digital payment systems can also protect passengers' anonymity and privacy. We have already developed one: GNU Taler. It is designed to be anonymous for the payer, but payees are always identified. We designed it that way so as not to facilitate tax dodging. All digital payment systems should be required to defend anonymity using this or a similar method.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An unjust state is more dangerous than terrorism, and too much security encourages an unjust state</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What about security? Such systems in areas where the public are admitted must be designed so they cannot track people. Video cameras should make a local recording that can be checked for the next few weeks if a crime occurs, but should not allow remote viewing without physical collection of the recording. Biometric systems should be designed so they only recognise people on a court-ordered list of suspects, to respect the privacy of the rest of us. An unjust state is more dangerous than terrorism, and too much security encourages an unjust state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The EU's GDPR regulations are well-meaning, but do not go very far. It will not deliver much privacy, because its rules are too lax. They permit collecting any data if it is somehow useful to the system, and it is easy to come up with a way to make any particular data useful for something.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GDPR makes much of requiring users (in some cases) to give consent for the collection of their data, but that doesn't do much good. System designers have become expert at manufacturing consent (to repurpose Noam Chomsky's phrase). Most users consent to a site's terms without reading them; a company that required users to trade their first-born child got consent from plenty of users. Then again, when a system is crucial for modern life, like buses and trains, users ignore the terms because refusal of consent is too painful to consider.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To restore privacy, we must stop surveillance before it even asks for consent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, don't forget the software in your own computer. If it is the non-free software of Apple, Google or Microsoft, it spies on you regularly. That's because it is controlled by a company that won't hesitate to spy on you. Companies tend to lose their scruples when that is profitable. By contrast, free (libre) software is controlled by its users. That user community keeps the software honest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg says that Facebook will&nbsp;stop short of committing to a strict new European Union law on data privacy.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The scandal hit firm is still reeling over the Cambridge Analytica revelations, which led to allegations of mishandling of personal data belonging to millions of its users.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This information was used to target voters in the US, based on psychological profiling, with political adverts spreading disinformation.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zuckeberg said that he agreed 'in spirit' with the new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a&nbsp;landmark EU law scheduled to take effect next month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, his firm will not be adopt it as the standard for the way the social network operates across the world, including the US.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scroll down for video&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zuckerberg told Reuters in a phone interview that Facebook was working on a version of the law that would work globally, bringing some European privacy guarantees worldwide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the 33-year-old billionaire demurred when asked what parts of the law he would not extend worldwide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We're still nailing down details on this, but it should directionally be, in spirit, the whole thing,' Zuckerberg said. He did not elaborate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His comments signal that US Facebook users, many of them still angry over the company's admission that political consultancy Cambridge Analytica got hold of Facebook data on 50 million members, could find themselves in a worse position than Europeans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The European&nbsp;GDPR law is the biggest overhaul of online privacy since the birth of the internet, giving Europeans the right to know what data is stored on them and the right to have it deleted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apple Inc and some other tech firms have said they do plan to give people in the United States and elsewhere the same protections and rights that Europeans will gain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shares of Facebook closed up 0.5 percent on Tuesday at $156.11 (&pound;111). They are down more than 15 percent since March 16, when the scandal broke over Cambridge Analytica.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Privacy advocacy groups have been urging Facebook and its Silicon Valley competitors such as Alphabet Inc's Google to apply EU data laws worldwide, largely without success.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We want Facebook and Google and all the other companies to immediately adopt in the United States and worldwide any new protections that they implement in Europe,' said Jeff Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, in Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zuckerberg said many of the tools that are part of the law, such as the ability of users to delete all their data, are already available for people on Facebook.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We think that this is a good opportunity to take that moment across the rest of the world,' he said. 'The vast majority of what is required here are things that we've already had for years across the world for everyone.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Google and Facebook are the global leaders in internet ad revenue. Both based in California, they possess enormous amounts of data on billions of people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Google has declined to comment on its plans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When GDPR takes effect on May 25, people in EU countries will gain the right to transfer their data to other social networks, for example.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook and its competitors will also need to be much more specific about how they plan to use people's data, and they will need to get explicit consent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GDPR is likely to hurt profit at Facebook because it could reduce the value of ads if the company cannot use personal information as freely and the added expense of hiring lawyers to ensure compliance with the new law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Data is central to Facebook's advertising business, and it has not yet sketched out a satisfying plan for how it plans to comply, said Pivotal Research analyst Brian Wieser.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I haven't heard any solutions from Facebook to get ahead of the problem yet,' Wieser said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Failure to comply with the law carries a maximum penalty of up to 4 percent of annual revenue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It should not be difficult for companies to extend EU practices and policies elsewhere because they already have systems in place, said Nicole Ozer, director of technology and civil liberties at the American Civil Liberties Union of California.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Companies' promises are less reassuring than laws, she said: 'If user privacy is going to be properly protected, the law has to require it.'</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">G&ouml;ran Marby, the chief executive of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) said privacy laws that come into force in May could mean crucial databases of website ownership, used to identify and shut down attacks, could be closed or &quot;fragmented&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is expected to lead to restrictions around the roughly 2,500 &quot;Whois&quot; databases that list who owns which websites. ICANN, which oversees the Whois system, is negotiating with data protection authorities in Europe about what information will remain on the databases as well as which groups such as police forces and cybersecurity companies will have privileged access to extra information. Giving authorities access to the databases is seen as crucial because identifying the root of a cyber attack or spam outbreak can make it easier to shut down the domain that such attacks are coming from. &quot;There are genuine needs for getting access to information. Police forces around the world would have automatic access,&quot; said Mr Marby.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The information is used to take down DDOS (distributed denial of service) attacks and find bad actors.&quot; Companies that operate the Whois databases fear they may fall foul of the GDPR with no clear guidelines on how they will work less than two months before the law comes into effect. Companies risk fines of up to (EURO)20m (&pound;18m) or 4pc of their turnover - whatever is higher - under the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ICANN is currently negotiating with the EU's 28 data protection authorities, saying it wants the system to be maintained in its current form but fears that a solution will not be arranged by May 25, when the GDPR comes into force.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps you were late with your council tax.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps you absent-mindedly wandered across a road without waiting for the red light.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps a neighbour dobbed you into the local authority for putting coffee grounds in your shared recycling bin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whatever your misdeed - and it is possible that you will never know exactly what it was - one day things start to go wrong. It is hardly perceptible at first. You might go to pay at the till in John Lewis only to discover that your credit card has been blocked. When you walk into certain upmarket restaurants, an alarm goes off and you are discreetly bundled out by a couple of waiters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Your sullied past follows you around like a shadow. You are banned from flying or taking trains. When people call your phone, the ringtone is transmogrified into a blaring police siren followed by a synthesised voice identifying you as a &quot;discredited person&quot; to everyone in earshot. Eventually your face and your national insurance number begin to appear on 5m-tall television screens in the city centre.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the situation in which several million Chinese people are stuck today. By the end of 2020 Beijing intends to give each of the 1.3 billion citizens under its jurisdiction a &quot;social credit&quot; score that measures his or her trustworthiness and rectitude. Almost every aspect of an individual's life, from their career prospects to the speed of their internet connection, will in theory come to depend upon this single number.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some thinkers regard these plans as the perfection of the art of dictatorship, an &quot;authoritarian dreamworld&quot; whose ideology could spread around the world like a virus and whose legitimacy is secured by the most comprehensive and powerful state surveillance apparatus in history. &quot;It's so dystopian,&quot; Johan Lagerkvist, professor of Chinese language and culture at the University of Stockholm, says. &quot;They are going the full monty. The direction and the ambition are really draconian.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others draw uncomfortable parallels between the way Beijing is weaving together vast skeins of data on its citizens and the addiction of Facebook and Google to the personal information of their users. Yet much remains uncertain. Is the government truly prepared to embrace belt-and-braces cybertotalitarianism, with all the effort and expense that will entail? Is the technology up to the job? And surely it could never happen here - could it?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The social credit system has yet to assume its final form. At the moment it consists of about 30 experimental permutations in various cities and regions. Each has its own approach, but the idea is the same. You start with a rating of, say, 300 points. You can earn more points by paying your debts on time or making responsible-looking purchases, such as nappies or a hole-puncher. You also get points for good deeds with a moral or civic dimension, such as donating blood, taking public transport or snitching on a cousin with a secret stash of foreign currency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As your credit score rises above 500, the rewards get commensurately better. You might get a discount on your broadband, a fast-track visa to Europe or, if you live in Guangzhou, a free three-day test drive in the latest Ford, dispensed by a giant car-vending machine with cat ears. Some cities even promote the profiles of highly rated citizens on Baihe, a popular dating website.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You can also lose points, whether by frittering away your money on frivolous luxuries such as alcohol or computer games, through brushes with the law, or simply because you associate with politically unsavoury people. It might be that the location data on your phone shows you have been spending your evenings in a house of ill repute, or that your friend reacted to the abolition of the limits on Xi Jinping's term as president by posting an inadvisable Animal Farm meme on Weibo, the Chinese equivalent of Twitter. Then the punishments kick in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is not hard to see the dark side of the system. Like Peter Lilley and the Lord High Executioner in The Mikado, the Chinese authorities have got a little list. In fact the list is quite a lengthy one: by the end of 2015 it contained 3.1 million names. Among them is that of Liu Hu. Three years ago Mr Liu, an investigative reporter, lost a libel action after accusing a Communist Party official of extortion. He was a few months late in wiring a sum of money to the court to pay for an apology in a newspaper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Liu only discovered that he had been blacklisted when he was blocked from buying a plane ticket. After making two further apologies, he has had his travel ban lifted, but remains debarred from applying for credit cards, according to Human Rights Watch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Liu is among the early victims of the latest and most crushing phase of what his government likes to call &quot;sincerity construction&quot;. The social credit project is merely the apotheosis of a long-cherished ambition to &quot;allow the trustworthy to roam everywhere under heaven while making it hard for the discredited to take a single step&quot;. It is, in the words of the American writer Adam Greenfield, a &quot;marriage of database and truncheon&quot;. But it is not just a tool for suppressing dissent and dealing with uppity nationalist movements in Tibet, Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia. It is, at least in theory, a code for mechanising people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On June 25, 1945, weeks after the Red Army had rolled over Berlin, Stalin stood before a reception in the Kremlin and proposed a toast to the vintiki, the ordinary people who were the innumerable screws in the &quot;state machine&quot; of the USSR. In his grand vision, teachers and writers were the &quot;engineers of the human soul&quot;. Society was to be twisted, rewired, recalibrated and where necessary ground down until it operated like a vast production line composed of 170 million bodies moving in unison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stalin's screw metaphor became a clich&eacute; of the first rank in communist China. Mao loved it and trotted it out frequently in his speeches. &quot;A man's usefulness to the revolutionary cause is like a screw in a machine,&quot; a young soldier called Lei Feng is supposed to have written in a diary that has become a staple of Maoist propaganda. &quot;It is only by the many and interconnecting screws that the machine can move freely, increasing its enormous work power. Though a screw is small, its use is beyond estimation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is only in the 21st century, though, that the government has acquired the technological means to realise this dream. Some of these tools will be familiar to western readers. Nine years ago China had 2.7 million CCTV cameras, roughly half as many as Britain. By the end of the decade it is forecast to have more than 400 million. These include at least 700,000 in Beijing, which is said to have achieved &quot;100 per cent CCTV coverage&quot;, and a million across an urban corridor in the province of Guangdong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are also 700 million of the highly portable tracking and eavesdropping devices commonly known as smartphones. Communications are routed through app stores and cables controlled by the state, which shut down the internet for ten months during civil unrest in the province of Xinjiang a decade ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Xinjiang, where the authorities are struggling to suppress an occasionally violent Uighur separatist movement, is also the petri dish and justification for a new wave of authoritarian gadgets. The police brandish iris and body scanners at checkpoints. They have begun harvesting DNA and blood samples from every citizen between the ages of 12 and 65, even where there is no suspicion of a crime. Since last summer, all the vehicles in the province's Bayingol prefecture have been required by law to carry satellite tracking devices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Law enforcement officers wear Google Glass-like headsets equipped with facial recognition scanners to help them to identify criminals. In January Xinjiang started trialling a CCTV-based &quot;alert system&quot; that automatically raises the alarm if an individual of interest wanders more than 300m from his home or workplace. The systems are becoming eerily accurate. In a stunt carried out in Guiyang last year, it took the authorities all of seven minutes to find and arrest a BBC reporter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the most subtle and insidious of the technologies is invisible. At the heart of the social credit scheme is a nest of algorithms that suck information out of hundreds of different databases to create a meticulous profile of every individual in the country. The idea is not only to know the whereabouts and the doings of all the people, all the time. It is to be able to predict where they will go and what they will do in the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">China wants to be the world's leading artificial intelligence power by 2030. Its AIs already scurry around the web scrubbing out violent, pornographic or politically questionable material. Yet the sheer volume of personal data in the hands of the state should allow it to make a supercharged, 21st-century version of the dang'an, the old paper files in which citizens' &quot;performance and attitudes&quot; were logged by the party. Again in Xinjiang, the authorities have begun seizing suspected criminals on the strength of AI predictions about their activities. It is a high-tech incarnation of the pre-crime police force in the film Minority Report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The social credit system extends the reach of the state into the totality of its subjects' lives. It means to take the apparatus of the police state and install it in the minds of its citizens. And the remarkable thing is that it seems to work. Within months of the launch of one social credit programme, more than 100,000 people had boasted about their scores on Weibo. The silence from the losers is deafening. Self-censorship has to some extent been second nature in China for more than half a century but now it is being automated. The authorities appear largely to have succeeded at what the technology writer Rachel Botsman has neatly described as &quot;gamifying obedience&quot; to the state. Or, as Johan Lagerkvist puts it: &quot;This is the Huxley thing - people are happy-golucky about it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is often something a little defensive in our clich&eacute;s about foreign countries. Perhaps it is a way of disowning the awkward parts of our own identity. When we say that the Germans are addicted to rules, or the Russians are credulous nationalistic dupes, we are simply trying to reassure ourselves that we are none of these things.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The social credit project is a case in point. All of its ingredients are present in the West, albeit in a distributed form. Berlin is testing terroristspotting facial recognition cameras in an experiment one statistician memorably compared to a dice-throwing chimpanzee. Last year The Times revealed that a Chinese company called Hikvision had sold 1.2 million CCTV cameras, some of which can see in the dark, recognise numberplates and count the people entering and leaving buildings, to clients in the UK. The buyers included Stansted airport and two local authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of the tools, however, are in private hands. We live in a golden age of corporate mass surveillance. Credit-scoring firms are increasingly dealing in stuff that bears no relation to a bank statement, such as individuals' social networks. Insurance companies kit out cars with tracking transponders to keep tabs on their mileage. Vitality Health, a British medical insurer, gives discounts to some customers if it can see from their Fitbits that they have been exercising properly. Facebook, as it emerged this week, has been hoovering up records of its members' calls and texts, often without their knowing it. Cambridge Analytica notoriously claimed to have amassed more than 4,000 data points on every adult in America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is both the promise and the curse of big data. The more that is known about how people behave in aggregate, the more we will be judged on the traces that our choices and actions leave in cyberspace; and the more our future choices and actions will be shaped by these systems. The net effect is a ratchet of conformity that qualitatively, if not quantitatively, resembles the social credit programme. A cynic would say that Beijing is simply pursuing social capitalism with Chinese characteristics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some people see the Chinese system as moving towards digital totalitarianism,&quot; Hetan Shah, executive director of the Royal Statistical Society, says. &quot;Whether that's true or not, it does pose a thought experiment for us which we must guard against.&quot; Mr Shah sees hopeful signs that Britain will be well protected against abuses of the technology. The government is planning a data ethics centre that will address some of these problems. It is also in the middle of implementing the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a raft of European legislation intended to give citizens a greater measure of control over how their personal information is used by private companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others are less confident that the West's defences will hold. Gerd Gigerenzer, a psychologist at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development in Berlin, is leading a review of these intrusive practices for the German ministry of justice. It is not likely to be an uplifting read.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Professor Gigerenzer views the episode of the TV series Black Mirror in which a rating app has turned society into a state-sponsored popularity contest as more of a prophecy than a fantasy. If the Chinese social credit project works, he fears that the model of omnipresent, omnipotent government could prove an irresistible alternative to the unholy mess of democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Chinese officials think the age of democracy is coming to an end,&quot; Professor Gigerenzer says. &quot;We need to be very clear about what our values are. One can have an argument that as long as it's a benevolent dictatorship, you're better off than in a democracy that can elect someone like Trump.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It could never happen here. Until, perhaps, it does.</SPAN></P>

Cambridge Analytica notoriously claimed to have amassed more than 4,000 data points on every adult in America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is both the promise and the curse of big data. The more that is known about how people behave in aggregate, the more we will be judged on the traces that our choices and actions leave in cyberspace; and the more our future choices and actions will be shaped by these systems. The net effect is a ratchet of conformity that qualitatively, if not quantitatively, resembles the social credit programme. A cynic would say that Beijing is simply pursuing social capitalism with Chinese characteristics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some people see the Chinese system as moving towards digital totalitarianism,&quot; Hetan Shah, executive director of the Royal Statistical Society, says. &quot;Whether that's true or not, it does pose a thought experiment for us which we must guard against.&quot; Mr Shah sees hopeful signs that Britain will be well protected against abuses of the technology. The government is planning a data ethics centre that will address some of these problems. It is also in the middle of implementing the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a raft of European legislation intended to give citizens a greater measure of control over how their personal information is used by private companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others are less confident that the West's defences will hold. Gerd Gigerenzer, a psychologist at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development in Berlin, is leading a review of these intrusive practices for the German ministry of justice. It is not likely to be an uplifting read.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Professor Gigerenzer views the episode of the TV series Black Mirror in which a rating app has turned society into a state-sponsored popularity contest as more of a prophecy than a fantasy. If the Chinese social credit project works, he fears that the model of omnipresent, omnipotent government could prove an irresistible alternative to the unholy mess of democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Chinese officials think the age of democracy is coming to an end,&quot; Professor Gigerenzer says. &quot;We need to be very clear about what our values are. One can have an argument that as long as it's a benevolent dictatorship, you're better off than in a democracy that can elect someone like Trump.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It could never happen here. Until, perhaps, it does.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TECHNOLOGY firms are scrambling to update their privacy settings before the European Commission brings in new data laws in May. GDPR, or general data protection regulation, is an EU-wide set of rules around personal data.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It applies to data used by businesses and organisations, sets standards for how it is used, brings in rules for reporting data breaches, and requires that organisations gain consent, or an opt-in, for gathering data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The regulations come into force on May 25, meaning businesses will have to change their notifications for collecting data from users. Importantly for tech giants like Amazon, Facebook and Google, GDPR will apply to companies based outside the EU, and any company handling EU data will have to comply with the rules.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What are the requirements? Article 5 of GDPR sets out principles for collecting personal data. It states that: data must be collected for a specific purpose; it must be limited and relevant; it must be accurate and up to date; it must be kept for no longer than is necessary; and it must be secure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Individuals also get bulked up rights under GDPR. These include the right to be informed, so users get better and clearer information about the data they are giving up; the right to be forgotten; the right to see what data has been processed; and, importantly, that their data can only be gathered with active consent and not harvested indiscriminately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the event of a data breach, businesses must quickly inform users within a 72-hour deadline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What are the potential fines? GDPR has businesses worried due to the potential fines that can be imposed if they don't comply. The biggest impact will be on companies that suffer a data breach. Firstly, companies must inform users within 72 hours or face a (EURO)10m (&pound;8.7m) fine, or 2pc of their turnover, and those found not to have followed the rules around processing data could face fines of (EURO)20m, or 4pc of turnover.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These are far greater than fines currently meted out under current rules. TalkTalk was fined &pound;400,000 by the Information Commissioner's Office in 2016, a record, but this would have been &pound;59m under the new rules. That said, the ICO is supposed to enact &quot;proportionate&quot; fines, so they may not be so steep.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What impact will Brexit have? While Brexit will change plenty of UK laws, so far GDPR has not been affected. GDPR will come into effect before Brexit next year, and in the Queen's Speech last year the Government set out that GDPR would bring the rules into UK law post Brexit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Are businesses prepared? In short, no. Most businesses are still working out how they will be affected. According to a report from EY, only a third of businesses around the world said they had a plan for GDPR. A report in February from the Department of Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said that fewer than 50pc of UK firms had made changes to comply with GDPR. The general picture is that plenty of businesses don't realise they need to make changes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FACEBOOK has shut down a programme that allows advertisers to target individuals using information obtained from third-party data sellers after the UK's data watchdog raised concerns about the practice.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the latest privacy pledge from the social network, which has been fighting a torrent of criticism that it has failed to protect users' privacy, Facebook said it would stop using information from &quot;data brokers&quot; such as Experian, the credit checking agency. Facebook would access the information in exchange for sharing revenue from adverts with the data providers. It was able to use the data to target adverts at particular groups of people even when Facebook users had not given the social network the data themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The programme allowed businesses to direct adverts at groups such as home owners or with certain purchase histories. &quot;While this is common industry practice, we believe this step, winding down over the next six months, will help improve people's privacy on Facebook,&quot; Graham Mudd, of Facebook, said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is unclear why it took the decision to cut off ties with data brokers, which is likely to mean a significant amount of lost advertising revenue, but the UK's privacy regulator said it had been pushing the firm over the issue and would soon release more details.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elizabeth Denham, the information commissioner, who has been investigating how data was used for political purposes during the Brexit referendum and last year's election, said: &quot;I have been examining this service in the context of my wider investigation into the use of personal data for political purposes and had raised it with Facebook as a significant area of concern.&quot; Frederike Kaltheuner, of campaign group Privacy International, said: &quot;It is extremely hard to learn what data brokers hold on you as an individual. The only time users might be informed about their existence is in the privacy policies of data broker customers like Facebook.&quot; Shares in Acxiom, one of the data brokers Facebook used, fell by 20pc yesterday. Facebook, which has been buffeted by allegations it failed to protect users and allowed the data of 50m users to be harvested and retained for years by Cambridge Analytica, the election consultancy, has made a series of privacy pledges in recent days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier this week it overhauled its privacy settings to prepare for strict European data laws known as the GDPR that will come into force in May. Apple also unveiled a privacy overhaul in anticipation of the new laws. A software update released yesterday will mean users are shown extra information about how personal information is shared with Apple.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company will also let users delete their accounts, or &quot;deactivate&quot; them so that no personal data is processed by Apple. A new section of Apple's website in May will let users download all data held by the company. Apple says it takes a &quot;comprehensive approach to privacy&quot; and differs from other technology companies in selling hardware rather than online advertising.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The features mean users are shown more information about the ways in which their personal information is shared with Apple.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They will also allow users to delete or deactivate their accounts so that Apple is no longer able to process their personal data.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest software update also includes new Animoji characters, improved augmented reality features, and the ability to turn off processor throttling for iPhones with old batteries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scroll down for video&nbsp;iOS 11.3 and macOS 10.13.4 now have updated data and privacy information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Privacy features&nbsp;                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the biggest updates in iOS 11.3 and macOS 10.13.4 is improved data management.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Users will now see a new data privacy information page when they update the software.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This page will be used to explain a new icon which appears when an Apple feature collects personal information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The icon will not appear on features such as Apple's Maps or Siri, for example, because they do not collect user data, whereas it will appear on the App Store or iTunes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Apple believes privacy is a fundamental human right so every Apple product is designed to minimise the collection and use of your data, use on-device processing whenever possible, and provide transparency and control over your information,' the company said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From May the device-maker will also introduce new privacy management tools on the Apple ID website allowing users to get a copy of all their data held by Apple, request a correction, deactivate or delete their account.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest update is an attempt by Tim Cook to distance himself from the likes of Facebook.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook is currently embroiled in a major privacy scandal after millions of users' data were improperly accessed by a political consultancy.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also comes as technology companies strive to bring their services into line with a tough new EU data protection law.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) enters into force on May 25 and is the biggest shake-up of privacy rules since the birth of the internet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It introduces stiff fines of up to 4 percent of global turnover for companies found to be in breach of the new rules.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Battery performance                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">iOS 11.3 adds new features to show battery health of an iPhone and recommend if a battery needs to be serviced.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These can be found in Settings -&gt; Battery and are available for iPhone 6 and later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Users can now see if the power management feature that dynamically manages maximum performance to prevent unexpected shutdowns, first introduced in iOS 10.2.1, is on and can choose to turn it off.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This feature can be found in Settings -&gt; Battery and is available for iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone SE, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The update tool is the result of a barrage of criticism that Apple faced when it was revealed that iOS automatically slows down processor performance in some iPhones to prevent unexpected shutdowns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tech giant now faces some 60 lawsuits from users that claim Apple slowed down older iPhones to make them buy new ones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least 32 lawsuits had been filed against Apple in January and, since then, the number has continued to climb.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Health records&nbsp;                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The iOS Health app has gained a Health Records section.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new addition allow patients of almost participating 40 health care institutions in the US can view their health records.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apple says that this data is encrypted and protected by a passcode.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Augmented reality                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apple's ARKit augmented-reality apps had one major limitation; it could only recognize horizontal surfaces, such as floors and tables,&nbsp; when deciding where to place virtual objects.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With iOS 11.3, apps can now deliver AR experiences that use vertical surfaces like walls and doors, in addition to horizontal surfaces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They can also more accurately map to irregularly shaped surfaces like circular tables.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Using advanced computer vision techniques to find and recognize the position of 2D images such as signs, posters and artwork, ARKit can integrate these real world images into AR experiences such as filling a museum with interactive exhibits or bringing a movie poster to life,' Apple says.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The view of the real world through the camera now has 50 percent greater resolution and supports auto-focus for an even sharper perspective.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Animoji                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four new Animoji characters have been introduced for iPhone X users.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They will bring user expressions to life as a lion, bear, dragon or skull.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The A11 Bionic chip and TrueDepth camera give users the ability to record and send Animoji messages using their voice and more than 50 different facial muscle movements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Business chat                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Business Chat is a new way for users to communicate directly with businesses using the Messages app on iPhone and iPad.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From today, Business Chat will be available in beta in the US and business will begin rolling out this new messaging feature for customers.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When searching for a business in Maps, Safari, Search or Siri on iPhone and iPad, users will see the option to contact the business using Messages to ask a question about a product or service, or make a purchase using Apple Pay.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These conversations can be continued on Apple Watch or Mac. Users are always in control of whether they share any contact information with a business on Business Chat.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HomeKit software authentication provides a great new way for developers to add HomeKit support to existing accessories while protecting privacy and security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Support for Advanced Mobile Location (AML) to automatically send a user's current location when making a call to emergency services in countries where AML is supported.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the biggest updates in iOS 11.3 and macOS 10.13.4 is improved data management.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Users will now see a new data privacy information page when they update the software.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This page will be used to explain a new icon which appears when an Apple feature collects personal information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The icon will not appear on features such as Apple's Maps or Siri, for example, because they do not collect user data, whereas it will appear on the App Store or iTunes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Apple believes privacy is a fundamental human right so every Apple product is designed to minimise the collection and use of your data, use on-device processing whenever possible, and provide transparency and control over your information,' the company said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From May the device-maker will also introduce new privacy management tools on the Apple ID website allowing users to get a copy of all their data held by Apple, request a correction, deactivate or delete their account.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest update is an attempt by Tim Cook to distance himself from the likes of Facebook.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook is currently embroiled in a major privacy scandal after millions of users' data were improperly accessed by a political consultancy.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also comes as technology companies strive to bring their services into line with a tough new EU data protection law.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) enters into force on May 25 and is the biggest shake-up of privacy rules since the birth of the internet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It introduces stiff fines of up to 4 percent of global turnover for companies found to be in breach of the new rules.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Battery performance                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">iOS 11.3 adds new features to show battery health of an iPhone and recommend if a battery needs to be serviced.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These can be found in Settings -&gt; Battery and are available for iPhone 6 and later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Users can now see if the power management feature that dynamically manages maximum performance to prevent unexpected shutdowns, first introduced in iOS 10.2.1, is on and can choose to turn it off.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This feature can be found in Settings -&gt; Battery and is available for iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone SE, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The update tool is the result of a barrage of criticism that Apple faced when it was revealed that iOS automatically slows down processor performance in some iPhones to prevent unexpected shutdowns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tech giant now faces some 60 lawsuits from users that claim Apple slowed down older iPhones to make them buy new ones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least 32 lawsuits had been filed against Apple in January and, since then, the number has continued to climb.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Health records&nbsp;                   </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new addition allow patients of almost participating 40 health care institutions in the US can view their health records.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apple's ARKit augmented-reality apps had one major limitation; it could only recognize horizontal surfaces, such as floors and tables,&nbsp; when deciding where to place virtual objects.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With iOS 11.3, apps can now deliver AR experiences that use vertical surfaces like walls and doors, in addition to horizontal surfaces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They can also more accurately map to irregularly shaped surfaces like circular tables.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Using advanced computer vision techniques to find and recognize the position of 2D images such as signs, posters and artwork, ARKit can integrate these real world images into AR experiences such as filling a museum with interactive exhibits or bringing a movie poster to life,' Apple says.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FACEBOOK has pledged to overhaul the social network's privacy settings to allow people to easily delete data, amid a swirling privacy row over the information it collects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company said it would introduce tools that let users see all the information held by the website and download their own copy or destroy it. The feature will also allow users to port information to another social media site if they wish to leave Facebook.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The changes are designed to comply with strict new European privacy laws and were not introduced in response to a Facebook-user backlash over data following the Cambridge Analytica controversy, the company said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which comes into force in May, demands that companies give customers much greater control over their data and comes with heavy fines, of up to 4pc of global revenues, if they break the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook is likely to face heavy scrutiny when the law comes into effect due to the Cambridge Analytica controversy that has battered its share price. The firm has been fighting accusations that it failed to protect users' private data when the election consultancy obtained data from 50m accounts before 2015.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Current data laws allow a maximum fine of &pound;500,000 but under the GDPR this would increase to as much as (EURO)1.6bn (&pound;1.1bn). EU sources said a Facebook-style data breach would be likely to draw the most draconian penalty available.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This data breach would be a clear candidate for the maximum fine,&quot; one source told The Daily Telegraph.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook's chief privacy officer Erin Egan admitted that it is currently too difficult for users to stay on top of their privacy. &quot;The last week showed how much more work we need to do to enforce our policies, and to help people understand how Facebook works and the choices they have over their data,&quot; she said. &quot;We've heard loud and clear that privacy settings and other important tools are too hard to find.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook yesterday said it had completely redesigned the settings on its smartphone app to make it easier to control what information is being shared with other users and what adverts users see. The changes are designed to replace 20 different privacy pages with one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Damian Collins, the chairman of the Commons digital, culture, media and sport select committee, also asked Mark Zuckerberg yesterday to reconsider the Facebook boss's snub the day before.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Collins said he planned to question Facebook's chief product officer Chris Cox in April, but that he hoped Mr Zuckerberg would also appear. &quot;Given the seriousness of these issues we still believe that Mr Zuckerberg himself is the right person to give evidence,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FACEBOOK is in danger of stage-managing its own downfall after shedding a massive $80 billion from the social networking giant's market value. Mark Zuckerberg's personal net worth has fallen by $14billion as his firm struggles to respond to a crisis one expert warned could make Facebook a &quot;potentially toxic asset&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GETTY</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook share price: Facebook has shed $80billion in market value Related articles  Facebook data scandal: How much information does Facebook store?   Facebook shares LATEST: Facebook stock PLUMMETS as forecast is cut </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook shares actually finished the day half a percent in the green yesterday but the rebound failed to stem the bleeding that has seen the firm lose 18 percent in market value following the Cambridge Analytica data privacy revelations in the UK, and a pending government investigation in the US.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As tech stocks around the world got dragged in to the downturn, Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index said that traders are continuing to rotate out of tech stocks, preferring to sit on the side-lines with so many regulatory questions remaining unanswered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said: &quot;Traders will want to have more clarity over where the Facebook data mismanagement scandal is heading and what the resultant regulatory clampdown will look like, not just for Facebook, but for the sector as a whole before any serious buying interest is likely to pick up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook is no stranger to controversy and has been able to comfortably resist judicial or governmental scrutiny so far.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GETTY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook share price: Users are concerned over how data has been used </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paul MacKenzie-Cummins from Clearly told Express.co.uk that for the best part of a decade, &quot;Facebook has dominated the social media sphere and each crisis that has come its way has simply slid off its seemingly Teflon-esque profile&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, he adds this latest crisis is the firm's biggest and potentially most damaging and the way the company reacts over the coming weeks will, in his view, determine its ability to recover and regain the trust lost.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kerim Derhalli, CEO and founder of investment app Invstr, told Express.co.uk although Facebook has faced crises before, this is the internet giant's biggest yet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: &quot;There has been a tide of distrust and distaste in the huge tech platforms, predominantly since Donald Trump's election, and the ongoing Cambridge Analytica furore hits many tech cynics to their core.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This could be a watershed moment, as it comes at a time when Facebook sign-ups are slowing, active time on their platform is declining and, once you lose public trust, it can be incredibly hard to regain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Industry analysts are point towards the growing criticism levelled against Facebook's business model as the single largest cause for investor concern.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There remains a real fear, if Facebook's business model invites increased legal scrutiny, then Mr Zuckerberg's firm's ability to both generate revenue and defend itself from costly legal battles will lead to a massive withdrawal of investor confidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Kerim Derhalli said: &quot;Fundamentally, Facebook's model is unsustainable. Selling peoples' data when they were making a few billion dollars was acceptable. Making tens of billions of dollars implies that there is something fundamentally wrong with the social contract between Facebook and their users.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I doubt Facebook will ever recover both from the loss of trust and the upcoming competitive challenge.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Evgeny Chereshnev, CEO at Biolink.Tech told Express.co.uk yesterday that he worst-case scenario for the tech giant is bankruptcy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: &quot;If there is rock-hard proof and evidence that Facebook data has been used to influence Trump's election, the Brexit decision and many other political voting processes, Facebook could go bankrupt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Trust in Facebook has been broken, and investors are dumping stock primarily because of that. There is too much at stake as it's now a potentially toxic asset due the information revealed by whistleblowers and the potential investigation results.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The amount of legal cases and the dollar amounts of those, especially when GDPR law comes into effect, are potentially too high even for Facebook to handle.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apple is launching a major privacy push, with software updates across all its devices to introduce new data privacy information immediately, with an updated website offering new privacy management tools to follow in May.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thursday's updates (macOS 10.13.4, iOS11.3 and tvOS 11.3) are prompted by the enormous new European data protection regulation GDPR, and have been in the works since at least January. But they come at a good time for the company, whose head Tim Cook has been merrily capitalising on the Facebook/Cambridge Analytica scandal, publicly rebuking Mark Zuckerberg over the social network's business model.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For users of the company's devices, the biggest change will be the introduction of a unified data privacy iconography, which now shows up alongside detailed information about how Apple uses personal data for its various first-party services. &quot;Apple believes privacy is a fundamental human right,&quot; the company will tell every user the first time they turn on their devices after the update, &quot;so every Apple product is designed to minimise the collection and use of your data, use on-device processing whenever possible, and provide transparency and control over your information&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the new features are prompted by GDPR, they are rolling out to users worldwide, and the company proudly notes that it has not had to change any of its software to comply with the new regulations. Unlike competitors such as Google, who operate on the principle that large scale data collection bestows an advantage in areas such as machine learning and transport planning, Apple has repeatedly argued that it has a responsibility to minimise data collection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking on Wednesday, Cook said &quot;We could make a ton of money if we monetised our customers, if our customers were our product ... We've elected not to do that. We're not going to traffic in your personal life. Privacy to us is a human right, a civil liberty.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Facebook logged SMS texts and phone calls without explicitly notifying users</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In May, shortly before GDPR takes effect, Apple will also update its website to make it easier for users to exercise four key rights granted by the regulation: getting a copy of their data; requesting a correction to their data; deactivating their accounts; and deleting their accounts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company sees an opportunity to distinguish from competitors there too: deactivation, in particular, is a much stronger implementation than in other platforms. It removes the user's information from all aggregated data stores, isolating their accounts but stopping short of deleting them.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jack Schofield</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">TECHNOLOGY; Version:1</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1255 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As a freelance media professional, I am often asked by my various employers to send copies of my passport, completed visa forms and other sensitive data in the form of email attachments. I have recently questioned this and have not really got a satisfactory response. I have tried uploading these documents to my Google Drive account and giving them a link, though I don't really know whether this method is any safer. However, I am at a loss to see how companies should acquire such sensitive data in light of the new GDPR rules coming into force in May. Robert</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which comes into force on May 25, will govern the storage and processing of data rather than its collection. It also includes some very important consumer rights. The most important are the right to be informed, the right of access, the right to correct errors, the right to erase data, the right to restrict processing, and the right take it elsewhere (data portability). How useful these will be in practice remains to be seen. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Personal data&quot; includes names, addresses, phone numbers and IP addresses, as well as what GDPR calls &quot;factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person&quot;. That includes biometrics such as face, fingerprint and iris recognition, and genetic information. In other words, you may have personal data that identifies someone even if you don't know their name.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GDPR applies to companies and organisations, particularly those with more than 250 employees. Home and household users are exempt. However, as a freelancer, you store and process data, even if the &quot;processing&quot; just means entering a name in an address book and looking it up. You should therefore do an audit of the devices and software you use to make sure that other people's personal data is protected. This may require the use of data backups, passwords, encryption, malware protection, and a VPN when using public hotspots. The GDPR also obliges you to tell people if there are any security breaches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You should also audit your data to make sure that you are only holding data that is necessary for your jobs, or that you are legally required to hold, eg for tax purposes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UK's Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has a useful 12-step plan ( PDF ), though like most things GDPR-related, it's aimed at companies. IBM's Liz Henderson provides a good summary in two posts on LinkedIn, GDPR Plan - Do you have yours? and GDPR Initial Steps, What's Next...?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Note: the GDPR is being modified and implemented in the UK by the data protection bill, which is still going through parliament. It should include some exceptions for journalism similar to the ones in the previous DPA, so check whether these apply to you.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   Email problems                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You are right to be concerned about sending things by email. Emails are more like plain text postcards because they can, in theory, be read at any of the many servers through which they pass, or by someone tapping a line. Of course, &quot;read by&quot; is unlikely to mean &quot;read by a human being.&quot; However, software can look for things like passwords and credit card numbers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A more likely problem is sending emails to the wrong address, either because users have got their own email addresses wrong (this happens surprisingly often), or through human error. Pick the wrong address from a list of auto-complete suggestions and you could send personal data to the wrong recipient. This would be a data breach that might have to be reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It would obviously be good thing if all emails were encrypted by default so that only the intended recipient could read them. Three decades of history says this isn't going to happen soon, if at all. Public key encryption is too hard for people who just want to send normal emails.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some large organisations do have encrypted email services, such as the NHS, but that doesn't help the rest of us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some people do choose secure email services, such as ProtonMail in Switzerland and Tutanota in Germany. However, you also have to send external recipients a password - for example, in an SMS text message - to decrypt the email.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tutanota users get an email that says &quot;you have an encrypted email&quot; and you click a link to read it, and reply to it, in a browser. You have to export the email if you want to keep a copy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are also plug-ins for Gmail and the Microsoft Outlook email program that provide secure email services. If one of your employers is using a secure system, they might let you join in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If there's no other alternative, you should encrypt and password-protect your images and documents before sending them as email attachments. Again, you must send the password separately, either via a different messaging service or in the post.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   Online storage locations                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a good idea to upload attachments and then send people a link. However, bear in mind that you are uploading documents to the company that probably runs the biggest surveillance operation on the planet. Encrypt your documents before you upload them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Encryption protects data if an online storage service is compromised - it has happened - or if your email is hacked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unfortunately, using Google Drive brings up an extra complication. If you are using Gmail, then you can assume that your data is being held in, or passing through, or accessible from the USA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GDPR does not oblige users to store data on servers inside the EU. However, there are extra requirements if servers are outside the EU. First, you need to have a legitimate reason for transferring personal data outside the EU. Second, you must have the consent of the person whose data is being exported. Third, you must give that person the option to opt out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In another post, the aforementioned Liz Henderson explains how to create a GDPR Privacy Notice, and you could adapt her sample to cover Gmail storage outside the EU.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You could switch to using an email service that operates wholly within the EU (see above), if only for any people who opt out, or you could upgrade to Google's paid-for service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Google claims that its G Suite and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services are fully compliant with GDPR, because it offers to sign EU Model Contract Clauses and a Data Processing Amendment. The fine print notes that &quot;the parties acknowledge and agree that Non-European Data Protection Legislation may also apply to the processing of Customer Personal Data&quot; and that &quot;Google will not process Customer Personal Data for Advertising purposes or serve Advertising in the Services&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I don't think GDPR will actually stop advertising-driven personal data processing. Just look forward to clicking &quot;I agree&quot; to lots of terms and conditions you won't even bother to read.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   IANAL!                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bear in mind that GDPR is a legal matter and I am not a lawyer. I am also not an expert on GDPR. Companies who can be fined up to (EURO)20 million or 4% of their annual turnover should take this stuff seriously and follow the ICO's advice. Lots of consultancies are offering guides, training, software toolkits and other services, too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Freelancers like us are not the target, but we should work to comply as best we can. In particular, don't keep any personal data you don't need, and store and use it securely. Indeed, you should do those things even if the GDPR didn't exist.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook is shutting down a feature that allowed &quot;data brokers&quot; such as Experian and Oracle to use their own reams of consumer information to target social network users, the company has announced.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The feature, known as &quot;Partner Categories&quot;, will be &quot;winding down over the next six months&quot;, Facebook announced in a terse blogpost. The company says the move &quot;will help improve people's privacy on Facebook.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Previously, data brokers were able to target specific sets of Facebook users, letting them bring their wider ad-targeting metrics on to Facebook. Now, they will either have to use Facebook's own targeting tools, or a much more specific form of targeting known as &quot;custom audiences&quot;, which broadly requires companies to have a prior relationship with the users they're targeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook is also closing down a data flow in the opposite direction, preventing the same data brokers from receiving anonymised information about how their ad campaigns have been received.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The moves come after weeks of bad press for Facebook, sparked by reporting in the Observer and the Guardian that revealed Facebook's lax oversight of data received by third parties. Brian Wieser, senior research analyst at Pivotal Research Group, described the move as &quot;an attempt to generate positive press on the privacy front without directly causing a meaningful negative revenue impact.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On the margins,&quot; he said, Facebook's claim that the change would improve people's privacy &quot;is probably true, but if privacy in the use of data on the platform were the goal, the change has relatively limited impact&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, the move could be an attempt to outflank competitors like Google, Wieser speculated. &quot;We can imagine that Facebook may want to try to make Google and others look worse by comparison to the extent that the use of third party data for targeting is a widespread and highly conventional activity in digital advertising.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Information Commissioner, Elizabeth Denham, welcomed the news that the feature was shutting down. &quot;I have been examining this service in the context of my wider investigation into the use of personal data for political purposes and had raised it with Facebook as a significant area of concern,&quot; she said. &quot;The use of third party sources of data will be covered in more detail in the report my office will publish soon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Wednesday, Facebook announced a raft of changes to its platform that were aimed at making it easier for users to alter their privacy settings, and ensure compliance with the forthcoming European data protection regulation, GDPR. &quot;We've heard loud and clear that privacy settings and other important tools are too hard to find, and that we must do more to keep people informed,&quot; two Facebook executives wrote in a blogpost.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apple has released its latest iPhone update. And perhaps its biggest change isn't really a change at all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The update brings with it a whole range of features, including the power management tools that Apple has long promised to fix after its battery controversy. But probably the most noticeable change is new boxes that will pop up to everyone, giving information about privacy and data use - not highlighting new features but instead pointing out old ones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those pop-ups will first appear when people update the phone, as part of the usual setup process, and will give people general information about the way their phone collects and uses data. They will continue to appear as people navigate through using the phone: every Apple app that gathers information about its user will show one of the boxes, which will describe how that data is being processed.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apple has long been far more privacy conscious than other major tech companies - a point that has been made as increasing pressure is turned on Facebook over alleged abuse of user data. The new features are being added partly in response to the new GDPR regulations on data that will come into force in May, but are in keeping with the companies historical commitment to openness and responsible use of data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new pop-ups allow Apple to emphasise that fact, while ensuring that people know how their data is being used. Despite their relatively conservative approach to data collection, the company does still gather information on its users, such as what music they listen to and what news stories they read.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Read more</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apple to reveal future of iPhone and other software</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first time users boot up their phone, they will see a message that explains that there is new branding in iOS and that there will be more information available about how data is being used. Then, when they open an app that uses that data - such as the App Store - they'll see a message explaining how it is being done, which they can tap for a full rundown of all the ways data is being collected and analysed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similar pages will be available in macOS and tvOS, all of which have been newly updated. They will all use the same branding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apple's new privacy push will see further releases in May. Then, Apple will roll out a special page to allow people to take control of their data - and delete it, if they wish.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The page will be part of the Apple ID account settings. By navigating to it, people will be able to get a copy of their data, correct it, deactivate their account so that Apple can't use its data or delete the account entirely and permanently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time the new update rolls out, Apple will update its privacy page. That will include information about the ways that people can protect their personal data, and information on how that data is being collected and used by Apple.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That page makes clear that Apple for the most part avoids collecting data as much as it can - an approach that has occasionally led it to be criticised for not having some of the same data-powered features that are present in products made by competitors such as Google. Apple uses techniques like differential privacy, for instance, which allows it to see trends in how people are using products without them actually being able to see anything about how individual people are doing so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While many of the new updates are being rolled out as part of Apple's commitment to introducing GDPR, they are being made available everywhere, not just in Europe.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook will give people new ways of seeing and deleting the data it collects on its users, it has said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest development comes as the social network continues to try and stop the damage from the Cambridge Analytica scandal, through which it became clear that the site was collecting many of its users' most sensitive and personal information. Now it says it will add new features in the next few weeks that will change the site's terms of service and its data policy so that people can see how their data is being collected. It will also give people new ways of deleting what has been collected and stopping further information being harvested, it claimed.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those tools will allow people to delete data selectively, as well as removing their account entirely, Facebook's announcement appeared to suggest. &quot;Some people want to delete things they've shared in the past, while others are just curious about the information Facebook has,&quot; it wrote. &quot;So we're introducing Access Your Information - a secure way for people to access and manage their information, such as posts, reactions, comments, and things you've searched for. You can go here to delete anything from your timeline or profile that you no longer want on Facebook.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of those new features are required by GDPR, the new data regulation being introduced by the EU in May that could hit companies such as Facebook. More changes will be announced in the coming weeks, Facebook said in the blog post, which was titled It's Time to Make Our Privacy Tools Easier to Find. The company has faced a global outcry after a whistleblower said that data from millions of users was improperly harvested by consultancy Cambridge Analytica to target US and British voters in close-run elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook shares are down nearly 18 per cent since 16 March, when it first acknowledged that user data had been improperly channelled to Cambridge Analytica, eating away nearly $100bn (&pound;71bn) of the company's market value. &quot;We've heard loud and clear that privacy settings and other important tools are too hard to find, and that we must do more to keep people informed,&quot; Erin Egan, Facebook's chief privacy officer, and Ashlie Beringer, its deputy general counsel, said in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to redesigning its settings menu on mobile devices, Facebook said it is creating a new privacy shortcut menu where users would be able to better secure their accounts and control personal information. It would also allow users to review and delete data they have shared, including posts and search queries. Users would be able to download the data shared with Facebook, including uploaded photos, contacts added to their account and posts on timelines.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the revelations aboutCambridge AnalyticaandFacebookin recent weeks, an increasing number of people have chosen to download their Facebook data and investigate exactly what information has been collected on them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Android phone users who downloaded the app in particular have been distressed to find logs of phone activity not relevant to their account, times calls were made and to who.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While many people have shown concern, and some have acted to improve their privacy and security online, the majority have said it either doesn't bother them, or that having to be alert to the problems - to change their settings and to consider a different way of online engagement- is simply too much hassle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But how much do you know about what you share and who you share it with? Check your phone settings - do you have your location services switched on? If yes that means every app, every service you use on your phone knows where you are.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This weekend, rather than idly browsing the internet, take half an hour to familiarise yourself with your data and follow these simple steps to safeguard your data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You can do this on an Android phone by going to your settings app on your device:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Take the time to see if you have given permission to your contacts, your photo album, your diary, your location, your microphone. Some apps won't need to know this information about you, you have the power to control who sees what.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GooglePlay settings can be foundhere</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many apps want to know your location but it is rarely necessary for them to know where you are. Where possible turn access to your location off completely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For apps that need to know where you are such as maps or car sharing apps like Uber, iPhone allow you to only share your location when using the app.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To do this:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     9 explosive claims from Cambridge Analytica whistleblower's evidence to MPs                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest version ofiOS 11on the iPhone also lets you stop your data being tracked. To do this:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You can also clear history and website data at the bottom of that screen - this may mean you have to input logins again but it is worth doing on a regular basis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When it comes to Facebook, first consider deleting the app and making the choice to log into only when you want to look at it. Having the app running on your device all the time enables the app to access contacts, diary, location, photos, microphone. Think about if this is necessary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If not delete the app and login via the website.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Second, familiarise yourself with the settings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cambridge Analytica whistleblower tells MPs about his predecessor's mysterious death</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Security</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Make sure you use a completely unique password one you do not use anywhere else. Make it a phrase rather than a word, lyrics from a song or a poem. Or a handful of words joined together squirrelseatbrownnuts for example, long passwords with random words are much harder to break.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Using two factor authentication is good, but it means providing your mobile telephone number.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Timeline and tagging helps you decide which of your friends can see what. Choosing 'Review what other people see on your timeline' is well worth clicking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It can be surprising, even with strong privacy settings, what info can leak out. Your profile photo and cover photo will always be public, but you do not need to permit access to anything else - all your photos, personal info, friends etc can be hidden away so no one other than the friends you have can see it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Notifications are your chance to stop facebook messaging you all the time. Being notified may seem helpful but it keeps you addicted to facebook. It is good to be able to switch off and think about other things.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apps, websites and plugins - click edit and choose disabled</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apps others use - click and untick every option,</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Click on the different headings</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You can choose whether you want Facebook to keep these interests, advertisers and information. If not, tap on the box and say no, or delete.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Location data again is really important. The more you tell facebook the more they will follow you.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the mobile app (on iOS and Android) go to settings, account settings, location, turn off location tracking and disable location history too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you want to see what Facebook hold about you on the settings page you will see Manage Account, click edit and scroll down.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Google</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whenever you go to Google there is a box on the page saying A privacy reminder from Google. Most of the time you probably ignore it. Don't. Take a moment to review your privacy settings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tap Review Now and read the brief information they give you.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then log into your Google account and make some choices about what you want them to know.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Click at the bottom - sign into your account</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you are already signed in, think about whether always being signed into Google is a good idea. It is the equivalent of leaving your front door open to your home and letting Google just wander around and watch what you do all the time you are online. Whenever possible log in and log out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When you are signed in click the circle in the right hand corner of the screen which indicates your account.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cambridge Analytica offices searched by Commissioner's Office</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What you will see here is likely to freak you out - as the amount of data Google collect about you can be enormous. But you now have the power to stop it if you want.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You can Pause what data Google collect about you and Manage Activity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You can stop Google storing searches you have made, stop them gathering your location and delete your location history, stop data being shared between devices, stop them recording your voice</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And stop them logging everything you do and watch onYouTube.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is just the start, but if you can begin the process of educating yourself about these settings and think what choices will protect you rather than expose you.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In May the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) comes into force, it is worth familiarising yourself with the eight data protection rights which we can all use to protect ourselves, including restricting access to data and challenging automated decision making and profiling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the offline world we take responsibility over our physical wellbeing, in the online world we must do the same for our digital selves. We are our data, we must take control of it and look after it, because once it's gone, like our physical health, it's gone.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two weeks have passed since the revelations aboutFacebookandCambridge Analyticawere published. In that time story after story has shown the extent to which our data has been misused, shared, sold and treated with disrespect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Articles are being shared by panicked users on how to delete their account. Facebook themselves have announced improvedprivacysettings and companies such as Mozilla have launched tools to keep the social media giant's data hungry eyes off your internet activity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Increasing numbers of people have chosen to download their Facebook data and investigate exactly what information has been collected on them.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many have laid bare their shock, anger and fear by what they have found. Android phone users who had downloaded the app in particular have been truly distressed to find logs of phone activity not relevant to their account, times calls were made and to whom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Why do Facebook need to know this&quot; they have asked, &quot;I had no choice to download the app if I wanted to message my friends. &quot;I can't believe they have a list of calls and messages it's none of their business&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     How to keep your data safe online - the easy steps you can take to protect your information                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How to guides are now appearing all over the internet. The extent to which Google track us is becoming the next big conversation point. And all I can say is, finally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I, along with many others, have been campaigning for years to raise awareness about the extent to which social media companies, advertisers and online services track, monitor and harvest our data. While people have shown concern, and some have acted to improve their privacy andsecurity online, the majority have said it either doesn't bother them, or having to be alert to the problems, to change their settings, to consider a different way of online engagement is simply too much hassle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Shocking video reveals how easily police can download your phone data WITHOUT a warrant                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now you could argue that it's not for the individual to have to take responsibility for themselves. That this is the problem of the companies, that their approach has been disgusting and that they need to change their business model. And I would agree wholeheartedly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, it is not as simple as just pointing the finger at them. We live in a connected world. Never in history have products and people been so intertwined. For the first time we are as much the product as we are the consumer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because internet connected devices, services and platforms rely on data to function, every time we engage, every time we share a piece of information, we keep the blood running through their veins. Without our data the body of social media, of smart products, of online shops and advertisers would simply stop breathing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are digital citizens. We are digital by default. The internet is now an essential service not a choice. Anyone who connects daily or has a smart device which is always on, always listening and monitoring, is part of the internet eco-system, willingly handing over data to gain instant information, instant communication, the ability to buy with one click, track and monitor health, and demand information from a device in the corner of the room.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Brits could get up to &pound;12,500 EACH from Facebook as expert warns of &pound;625 billion lawsuit against social network                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We may have evolved to accept connectivity as a benefit of living in the modern world, but we have not evolved to develop the much needed sixth sense which makes us see the journey our personal data takes. We imagine every engagement with a device or service as we do a human interaction. One on one, not one to many.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If our online engagement were to be made visible, we would be followed around by hundreds of people noting down everything we do and say and watching everyone we know. Whatever piece of information we actively shared, or they surreptitiously gleaned from us they would write down and analyse. It would terrify us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until we realise our data is a tangible thing, that we are sharing it willy nilly with companies we barely know, to people we cannot see, who are using and abusing it for their gain not for ours, we will remain insecure and at sea when revelations about data misuse come to light.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Bestiality website hacked and private details of over 3,000 users are leaked                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This weekend, rather than idly browsing the internet, take half an hour to familiarise yourself with your data. Think about what you share and with whom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Look at the apps on your phone, the settings on your smart products and the privacy settings on your social media accounts. Educate yourself about these settings and think what choices will protect you rather than expose you. In May the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) comes into force, it is worth familiarising yourself with the eight data protection rights which we can all use to protect ourselves, including restricting access to data and challenging automated decision making and profiling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the offline world we take responsibility over our physical wellbeing, in the online world we must do the same for our digital selves. We are our data, we must take control of it and look after it, because once it's gone, it's gone.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apple has launched a new privacy push that will mean the company notifying users when they send any personal data to the tech company, an apparent attempt to draw a line between the iPhone maker and companies such as Google and Facebook.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A software update released on Thursday will mean users are shown extra information about how personal information is shared with Apple, such as the App Store and iTunes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company will also let users delete their accounts entirely, or &quot;deactivate&quot; them so that no personal data is processed by Apple. A new section of Apple's website in May will let users download all the data held by the company, such as photos and contacts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The changes, which will come in a software update to iOS as well as the Mac and Apple TV operating systems on Thursday evening, are designed to comply with strict new European data protection laws known as the GDPR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, they also provide an opportunity for Apple to press its privacy credentials, following two weeks of damaging headlines about Facebook and the company's Cambridge Analytica scandal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apple says it takes a &quot;comprehensive approach to privacy&quot; and differs from other technology companies in selling hardware rather than online advertising. Its chief executive Tim Cook said earlier this week : &quot;We could make a ton of money if we monetised our customer - if our customer was our product. We've elected not to do that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The software update, iOS 11.3, will see a mean iPhone users presented with a new icon and notice when they start up the phone and when using apps such as the App Store or Apple Music in which data is sent to the company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company says its services such as Siri do not collect as much personal data as rival assistants because it anonymises much of the information, and that information such as users' fingerprints are kept on a device and never sent to the company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   Technology intelligence - newsletter promo - EOA                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apple will introduce privacy tools on its website in May, ahead of the May 25 GDPR deadline, which allow users to delete all their user data. The process will take seven days, in order to stop malicious attempts to delete the information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deactivating accounts will mean users can pick up where they left off if they decide to come back to Apple, but that no data will be used in the meantime.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Data is the new oil&quot; gurgles the catchphrase of the moment. And, like any oil spillage, the cost of clearing up and compensation after Facebook leaked the personal details of 50 million of its users is likely to be costly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week a Houston businessman filed a class action lawsuit in a US federal court targeting Facebook and Cambridge Analytica seeking $50 billion in damages. Similar suits have been launched in other US states, and in the UK Hayes Connor Solicitors, the Liverpool law firm, said that it was preparing a group claim.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Europe has already seen this. Three years ago the Austrian law graduate Max Schrems filed a class action suit against Facebook in Vienna for breaches of privacy rights under EU law. The case ended up in the Court of Justice of the European Union, which decided in January that Schrems could litigate in Vienna against the company. How that case will conclude remains to be seen, but it is clear that the European courts are primed for such challenges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The tort of misuse of personal information has emerged as a means by which individuals may claim compensation from organisations that use their personal data in a manner that causes them distress,&quot; says James Castro-Edwards of Wedlake Bell. &quot;This right to compensation is likely to be pursued by lawyers bringing class actions against abusive organisations. They will not be subject to the same constraints on resources as government-funded data protection authorities, and are likely to be both effective and prolific.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ben Robson of Oury Clark Solicitors says that although civil damages have long been available it is only since 2015 that the courts have held that a person can be compensated for distress in situations where no financial loss has been suffered. &quot;The level of damages that could be payable will largely depend upon the nature of the breach and the personal situation of the affected individuals,&quot; he says. &quot;However, there is some judicial guidance from a 2016 case involving the Home Office to suggest that a base level of &pound;2,500 may be applicable to distress-only claims.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Against this background it is clear that the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) - which entered into force in May 2016, but becomes fully enforceable on May 25 this year - arrives with perfect timing. That's because underpinning GDPR is the key principle of &quot;use limitation&quot;, ie that &quot;personal data should not be used for purposes outside of the original intended and specified purpose, except with the consent of the data subject or the authority of the law&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The GDPR reaffirms that any person who has suffered material or non-material damage as a result of an infringement of this regulation shall have the right to receive compensation for the damage suffered, ie uncapped damages,&quot; Robson says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So there is certainly the potential for large-scale class actions of affected data subjects to become a growing phenomenon - albeit much will depend upon the attitude and interpreta-tion of the courts to this area over the coming years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jane Finlayson-Brown of Allen &amp; Overy points out that social media and search engine companies were at the forefront of legislators' thoughts when designing GDPR. &quot;Regulators have always been concerned about the use of data in a manner the individual would not expect - whether that is exploitation, disclosure, extended retention or manipulation by third parties for totally unconnected purposes,&quot; she says. &quot;GDPR contains mechanisms to allow cross-border co-operation and consistency of regulatory enforcement. It will be interesting to see how easy it is for a co-ordinated approach to be taken.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And that's not the only change arising from GDPR. Emma Gross of SA Law points out: &quot;There will be significant changes for data controllers, like Facebook, who will now be tasked with providing easily accessible and intelligible policies on data protection and subject rights outlining their legal basis for processing data and informing data subjects of their right to have data deleted or rectified.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Added to that are the fines that regulators can impose. &quot;Breaching data protection law carries a maximum fine of only &pound;500,000 in the UK,&quot; says Mark Weston of Hill Dickinson. &quot;Would Facebook really care about that level of fine? However, the advent of GDPR provides for fines up to a maximum of the greater of (EURO)20 million or 4 per cent of annual global group turnover. It certainly cares about that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The final sting for platforms such as Facebook is that their responsibilities extend to the actions of rogue employees. &quot;[As well as] direct liability to those whose personal data they process companies may also have vicarious liability for the accidental, negligent, or even wilfully malicious actions of staff members in the handling of personal data,&quot; says Piers Leigh-Pollitt at Doyle Clayton. Companies preparing for GDPR should take note, Leigh-Pollitt says, and ensure that their management and crisis plans can minimise risks to the organisation and pre-empt actions by staff who go against company policy and procedure. Failure to do so could be catastrophically expensive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Suddenly the dangers of running a social media platform are looking decidedly high.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Time to log off? Times Law will return on April 12</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FACEBOOK'S shares are responding to the social media giant's most severe crisis to date after Bank of America Merrill Lynch slashed its price forecast for the second time in five days, while an expert has warned of it becoming a, &quot;potentially toxic asset&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GETTY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook shares LATEST: Mark Zuckerberg is under pressure</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bank of America analyst Justin Post reduced his 12-month price target on the social media giant to $210 from $230, in light of the Cambridge Analytica data privacy revelations in the UK, and a pending government investigation that Mr Post says &quot;raises the risk of civil penalties on data privacy violations&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shares in Facebook fell 4.9 percent Tuesday and the stock is down 9.4 percent so far this week and 16.1 percent this month, wiping around $60bn from the tech firm's value.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Federal Trade Commission confirmed on Monday that a non-public investigation has been opened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fiona Cincotta, Senior Market Analyst at City Index, told Express.co.uk that the &quot;Facebook contagion&quot; has infected all tech stocks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said: &quot;Facebook continued to fall dropping a further 4.9 percent and taking losses to 20 percent from its February peak as the fallout from the data mismanagement scandal continues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The overriding concern is that lawmakers and regulators will start to clamp on the use and management of data by the tech giants. Increased regulation could hit advertisers, Facebook's main income source, who could have reduced access to user data and therefore no longer be able to focus advertising in the way that they can at the moment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A hit to this revenue stream could be catastrophic to Facebook.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Paul MacKenzie-Cummins from Clearly told Express.co.uk that the fall-out from these revelations goes beyond the $60bn that has been wiped off Facebook's market value, the impact on its reputation could be far greater.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: &quot;Each time a new case arises, Facebook's response is the same: delay and hope the story simply goes away - which it never does - followed by denial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When that doesn't hold water, remorse sets in coupled with an unswerving pledge to 'fix Facebook' and 'prevent bad actors from accessing people's information'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is topped off by the admission that 'there's more we need to do'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For the best part of a decade, Facebook has dominated the social media sphere and each crisis that has come its way has simply slid off its seemingly Teflon-esque profile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This latest crisis, however, is its biggest and potentially most damaging and the way it reacts over the coming weeks will, in my view, determine its ability to recover and regain the trust it has lost.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook has fallen foul of users and investors for its handling of personal data following revelations in the UK that political research firm Cambridge Analytica wrongly gained access to personal data of more than 50 million people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A global campaign to &quot;delete Facebook&quot; has begun and Marie Page one of the UK's leading Facebook marketing authorities told Express.co.uk the social network has lost trust with its end users.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said: &quot;Despite terms and conditions to the contrary users assumed their data would be kept safe so in return for seeing the results of a gimmicky personality test or online quiz, they happily agreed to the Terms and Conditions not realising that their own data and that of their friends would be mined too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The perception is that Facebook should have been more protective of users' data. Zuckerberg's apology has recognised the erosion of trust that resulted and they are scrabbling to regain that and &quot;fix&quot; the various problems Facebook faces as a priority.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bank of America Bank of America analyst Justin Post said: &quot;The #deletefacebook campaign persists, though Google Trends suggest fervour peaked on March 23, and it remains unclear as to how many users actually are walking away. We see the second quarter of 2018 as the first real test of user trends.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However Mrs Page does not believe that the crisis is terminal, she said: &quot;Facebook's shares have taken a hit but they will bounce back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Facebook is the drug we can't do without. Users have short memories and their fear of missing out by deleting Facebook will soon overcome their concerns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Those looking to move to other platforms could well face similar issues there. Facebook owns two of the major alternatives: WhatsApp and Instagram - something many users do not realise.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Updates below throughout the day....</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook HQ: Zuckerberg has apologised in print</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.27pm - UPDATE - 'It's not great for Zuck'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Matt Donegan, CEO of Social Circle told Express.co.uk that Facebook's&nbsp;history has been mired in conflict since its inception.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr&nbsp;Donegan says that &quot;Zuck&quot; is the heavyweight champion of Silicon Valley and he knows how to throw some punches - and to deflect heavy blows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: &quot;Facebook's shares have plummeted by 16 percent, wiping $36bn off its market value. It's not great for Zuck, and while he may have &quot;lost&quot; a few $billion - my heart bleeds - the share price is likely to recover.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CEO says that Facebook should be caring about most is losing users, because the platform is seen to take more than it gives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He adds: &quot;The lynch mob is in force, and the #DeleteFacebook tag is trending, but time will tell how many people follow through the threats, and actually hit the delete button.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This news has brought home to people this tough truth and some don't like what they see. If this isn't addressed users will at best view Facebook ads with disdain, and at worst turn away from Facebook.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;An investor cares about one thing: Is my investment going to grow or decline. A drop in engaged users will immediately turn off advertisers - cue unhappy investors.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr&nbsp;Donegan believes that&nbsp;Facebook itself isn't dead as an idea but the platform has to focus on putting people and content at its centre, then build privacy conscious ways for contextual advertising to appear around that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: &quot;Cambridge Analytica has shed light on the less savoury practices of this social media goliath. Now will Joe Public be the David that fells Goliath?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.35pm - UPDATE - Facebook to go bankrupt?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Evgeny Chereshnev, CEO at Biolink.Tech told Express.co.uk that the worst could be yet to come for Facebook.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr&nbsp;Chereshnev said: &quot;If those find more evidence on potential data use for tampering with presidential elections, Brexit and other cases of basically brainwashing people, we would potentially see the new low.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CEO says that on March 16, Facebook stock was worth $185.02, today, March 28, it's 152.22.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He adds, &quot;they've lost $32.8 in share prices, which is huge. They were $537.69 billion in capitalisation. Today it's $442.2 - which means they've lost $95.48 billion dollars in 2 weeks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The worst-case scenario for the tech giant Mr&nbsp;Chereshnev warns is bankruptcy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: &quot;Trust in Facebook has been broken, and investors are dumping stock primarily because of that. There is too much at stake as it's now a potentially toxic asset due the information revealed by whistleblowers and the potential investigation results.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If there is rock-hard proof and evidence that Facebook data has been used to influence Trump's election, the Brexit decision and many other political voting processes, Facebook could go bankrupt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The amount of legal cases and the dollar amounts of those, especially when GDPR law comes into effect, are potentially too high even for Facebook to handle. They are potentially unprecedented.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are more than 25 million fans who engage with Playboy via our various Facebook pages, and we do not want to be complicit in exposing them to the reported practices.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook is launching a range of new tools in an effort to &quot;put people in more control over their privacy&quot; in the buildup to new EU regulations that tighten up data protection.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The changes come after a troubling two weeks for the company, which is battling with the fallout of the Cambridge Analytica files. At least one of the new features, a unified privacy dashboard, was previously discussed by Facebook's chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, back in January.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook is not committing to making it any easier for users to delete their accounts wholesale</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The last week showed how much more work we need to do to enforce our policies, and to help people understand how Facebook works and the choices they have over their data,&quot; two Facebook executives wrote in a blogpost announcing the changes. &quot;We've heard loud and clear that privacy settings and other important tools are too hard to find, and that we must do more to keep people informed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Erin Egan, Facebook's chief privacy officer, and Ashlie Beringer, its deputy general counsel, continued: &quot;Most of these updates have been in the works for some time, but the events of the past several days underscore their importance.&quot; The features will be available to all users, not just those in countries covered by the EU general data protection regulation (GDPR), which comes into effect on 25 May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On mobile devices, Facebook users will now be able to find all their settings in a single place, rather than spread across &quot;nearly 20 different screens&quot; as they were before. They will also be able to find a separate item, the &quot;privacy shortcuts&quot; menu, which provides a clearing house for options about data protection, ad personalisation and on-platform privacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The site is also complying with rules about access to stored personal data with a new &quot;access your information&quot; tool, that allows people to find, download and delete Facebook data. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Jeremy Deller distributes posters instructing how to delete Facebook</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Facebook is not committing to making it any easier for users to delete their accounts wholesale. The option to permanently delete an account is currently buried in a help menu, deprioritised in favour of the non-destructive option to &quot;deactivate&quot; a user account, which leaves all the data on Facebook's servers and accessible to the company's data-mining tools.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook says that further changes will come in response to user feedback, including updates to the terms of service and data policies. &quot;These updates are about transparency,&quot; Egan and Beringer write, &quot;not about gaining new rights to collect, use, or share data.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook will give people new ways of seeing and deleting the data it collects on its users, it has said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest development comes as the social network continues to try and stop the damage from the Cambridge Analytica scandal, through which it became clear that the site was collecting many of its users' most sensitive and personal information.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now it says it will add new features in the next few weeks that will change the site's terms of service and its data policy so that people can see how their data is being collected. It will also give people new ways of deleting what has been collected and stopping further information being harvested, it claimed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those tools will allow people to delete data selectively, as well as removing their account entirely, Facebook's announcement appeared to suggest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some people want to delete things they've shared in the past, while others are just curious about the information Facebook has,&quot; it wrote. &quot;So we're introducing Access Your Information - a secure way for people to access and manage their information, such as posts, reactions, comments, and things you've searched for. You can go here to delete anything from your timeline or profile that you no longer want on Facebook.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of those new features are required by GDPR, the new data regulation being introduced by the EU in May that could hit companies such as Facebook.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More changes will be announcedin the coming weeks, Facebook said in the blog post, which was titled It's Time to Make Our Privacy Tools Easier to Find.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company has faced a global outcry after a whistleblower said that data from millions of users was improperly harvested by consultancy Cambridge Analytica to target USand British voters in close-run elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Read more</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook admits collecting data on phone calls, but says people agreed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebookshares are down nearly 18 per cent since 16 March, when it first acknowledged that user data had been improperly channelled to Cambridge Analytica, eating away nearly $100bn(&pound;71bn)of the company's market value.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've heard loud and clear that privacy settings and other important tools are too hard to find, and that we must do more to keep people informed,&quot; Erin Egan,Facebook's chief privacy officer, and Ashlie Beringer, its deputy general counsel, said in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to redesigning its settings menu on mobile devices,Facebooksaid it is creating a new privacy shortcut menu where users would be able to better secure their accounts and control personal information. It would also allow users to review and delete data they have shared, including posts and search queries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Users would be able to download the data shared withFacebook, including uploaded photos, contacts added to their accountand posts on timelines.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook is making it easier for users to permanently delete data, amid a swirling privacy row over the information it collects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The social network said it would introduce a new tool that lets members find the information currently held by the website and download their own copy or destroy it. The feature will also allow users to port information to another social media site if they wish to leave Facebook.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook previously allowed users to delete information, but the process was onerous and required sleuthing through their histories.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The changes are designed to comply with strict new European privacy laws and were not introduced in response to a user backlash over data following the Cambridge Analytica controversy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook's chief privacy officer Erin Egan &nbsp;admitted that it is currently too difficult for users to stay on top of their privacy.&nbsp;&quot;The last week showed how much more work we need to do to enforce our policies,&nbsp;and to help people understand how Facebook works and the choices they have over their data,&quot; she said. &nbsp;&quot;We've heard loud and clear that privacy settings and other important tools are too hard to find, and that we must do more to keep people informed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Wednesday, Facebook said it had completely redesigned&nbsp;the settings on its smartphone app to make it easier to control what information is being shared with other users and&nbsp;what adverts users see. The changes are designed to replace 20 different privacy pages with one. However, the changes only apply to the mobile app, not the Facebook website.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is also introducing a way for users to see in one place all the personal data Facebook holds on them, such as statuses they have liked, posts and comments, and delete them individually or in bulk. The data will be deleted from accounts immediately, and from the social network within 90 days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alternatively, users will be able to download all the data and send it to another social network. Under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), new EU rules that are being mirrored in UK legislation, social networks will have to allow their data to be transferred to a rival, an attempt to encourage competition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook members&nbsp;are currently allowed to download their data, but the process is onerous and means it is received in a complicated format.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   Technology intelligence - newsletter promo - EOA                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Egan said the settings would prove that &quot;it's your data, after all&quot;, following a week in which Facebook has been accused of failing to protect its users after it emerged that information about 50m users had been harvested and obtained by election consultants Cambridge Analytica.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook said it would introduce the changes in the coming weeks, ahead of a May 25 deadline to comply with GDPR. It will also be changing its terms of service and data policy to comply with the new law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anyone working with technology start-ups in recent years would have struggled to avoid hearing founders talk proudly about how the exploitation of data sat at the heart of their business models.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trying to get them to speak up after revelations that information concerning 50 million Facebook users was wrongfully &quot;harvested&quot; by Cambridge Analytica, a data analysis company, was a trickier proposition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Many of them are preferring to duck the issue,&quot; one experienced technology industry consultant says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A paradigm of the technology industry in recent years has been the notion that &quot;data is the new oil&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Technology giants, including Facebook, have made fortunes from convincing people to give away a precious resource - their personal information - in return for little more than access to their platforms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The information can be exploited by advertisers and other businesses and, as a result, even after a week from hell, the social networking giant is still worth $463 billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Below mammoth data collectors such as Facebook sits a vast ecosystem of businesses that relies on the information they hold to inform, grow and provide a stamp of authenticity for their own services.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then there are the countless technology start-ups operating independently of Facebook that share their view of the value of user data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's nothing new in the idea of businesses exploiting data, but technology provides user data at a speed, scale and a level of detail that can make more traditional methods look like a blunt tool.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vast quantities of venture capital can be used to subsidise a start-up service that operates in the belief that the data it collects on users will make them a fortune when they allow third parties to access it. A start-up mobile banking business, for example, might offer a subsidised service to win users in the belief that once it reaches scale third-party financial services will pay for access to its customers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those willing to discuss what the Facebook scandal means for start-ups are divided over the implications. If data is the new oil, is the value of those intimate details of our lives that we put online over the past decade or so dawning on us at last? Signal Media is a venture capitalbacked business that uses technology to monitor the authenticity of media data, allowing customers to filter out &quot;fake news&quot;. David Benigson, its founder and chief executive, says people have been waking up to the &quot;value, use and misuse&quot; of their personal data and the attention on the issue in recent weeks has &quot;supercharged&quot; those concerns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Technology giants have been the conduit for many businesses to convince people to part with their data and Mr Benigson says that game may be up. &quot;People will now be significantly more wary of handing out personal data online and we will probably see more restrictive regulation over the next couple of years. This makes it much harder for new companies in the data/tech space to move forward from both an infrastructure perspective and as a consumer tool. Without a trusted brand, who will willingly give their data to a start-up, where security will probably be less impressive? &quot;Firms will now be much clearer about what they use data for and how they store and manage [it]. I just hope that innovation is not a casualty along the way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eileen Burbidge, a partner at Passion Capital, a venture capital investor, and a government adviser, is not convinced the fallout will be so profound. &quot;Data harvesting is pretty common and a valuable tool that businesses use to provide and deliver more relevant products and services. That is here to stay. The vast majority do not overstep the mark.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She says tougher regulations are needed governing how data harvesting is used to influence elections - which is the essence of the Cambridge Analytica controversy - along with greater transparency from businesses over data use but she doesn't believe the genie can be squeezed back into the bottle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think consumers are going to get less sensitive about their data. If data had been shared with Amazon for clothing sizes [instead of Cambridge Analytica] there wouldn't have been the same uproar [even if] the violations of the terms were the same.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Facebook scandal coincides with the introduction of new rules governing how all companies in the European Union handle data.The general data protection regulation (GDPR), which emanates from Brussels, is designed to hand control of personal data to individuals rather than organisations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From May 25, everyone from global technology giants to banks to startups will need consent to process consumers' personal data. Consent must be &quot;freely given&quot;. People must have signalled their willingness to share their data, not via a prepopulated tick box.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Companies will be required to obtain an unequivocal &quot;positive indication of agreement&quot; to personal data being processed. Silence will no longer count as consent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Personal data includes names, photos, email addresses, bank details, posts on social networking websites, medical information and computer IP addresses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Organisations that fail to comply can be fined up to 4 per cent of their annual global turnover, or (EURO)20 million, whichever is larger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Burbidge thinks the rules are &quot;positive&quot; and will be sufficient in most areas to boost transparency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nic Brisbourne, managing partner at Forward Partners, a backer of early-stage businesses, believes the soul-searching over the Facebook data breach points to a more significant moment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This issue is bigger than Facebook and my view is we are part way into a long-term trend of increasing regulation of the use of data. We are seeing start-ups' customers and investors starting to ask for evidence of GDPR compliance as a precondition for doing business and I expect to see the frequency and comprehensiveness of those checks to increase.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Call for 'sensible ground rules' to define use and abuse of data Ian Smith is chief executive and founder of Gospel Technology, a London-based start-up that helps businesses to share and monitor data safely using blockchain, the distributed ledger technology that also underpins cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin (James Hurley writes).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says the debate that has been prompted by the Facebook scandal signals a sea-change in how companies will look after data. &quot;This is huge. Start-ups have been relying on an effectively unregulated space for access to data.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the intent hasn't always been malicious, he believes there have been &quot;lies, deception and subterfuge&quot; as organisations have raced to mine user data. &quot;It may often be perfectly legal, but the effort with which some companies avoid being transparent about how they use our data reveals an uncomfortable moral landscape.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority, hinted that tougher rules may be needed so that non-financial companies are held to the same standards over data misuse as City firms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Information Commissioner's Office is the UK data regulator that can issue fines, warnings and data processing bans for those who breach information rules, but speaking to an audience of financial technology start-ups and investors, Mr Bailey appeared to suggest greater powers may be needed to regulate technology firms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We don't regulate on the space in the news [Facebook and Cambridge Analytica] but generically there's a similar issue, which is, from a public interest perspective and a public policy perspective, what are the sensible rules for using data given that one of the things that ... innovation enables is unlocking access to data on a scale that never happened previously?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We can't stand in the way of the fact that putting data to use is one of the rapidly growing powers within society Consumers want the benefit of it. Sometimes, we are all surprised to find out some of the things that have been going on.&quot; He added: &quot;Some people are saying you've got to get regulation in there, others are saying that would be terrible because it would kill innovation. I think the solution is to say you need to come up with sensible ground rules.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some of the different [regulatory] regimes have very different approaches to how you regulate things, some are more restrictive than others. That merits examination of what is the sensible and better way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A &quot;transparent debate&quot; was needed, Mr Bailey said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority, hinted that tougher rules may be needed so that non-financial companies are held to the same standards over data misuse as City firms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Information Commissioner's Office is the UK data regulator that can issue fines, warnings and data processing bans for those who breach information rules, but speaking to an audience of financial technology start-ups and investors, Mr Bailey appeared to suggest greater powers may be needed to regulate technology firms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We don't regulate on the space in the news [Facebook and Cambridge Analytica] but generically there's a similar issue, which is, from a public interest perspective and a public policy perspective, what are the sensible rules for using data given that one of the things that ... innovation enables is unlocking access to data on a scale that never happened previously? &quot;We can't stand in the way of the fact that putting data to use is one of the rapidly growing powers within society Consumers want the benefit of it. Sometimes, we are all surprised to find out some of the things that have been going on.&quot; He added: &quot;Some people are saying you've got to get regulation in there, others are saying that would be terrible because it would kill innovation. I think the solution is to say you need to come up with sensible ground rules.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some of the different [regulatory] regimes have very different approaches to how you regulate things, some are more restrictive than others. That merits examination of what is the sensible and better way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A &quot;transparent debate&quot; was needed, Mr Bailey said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a puzzling thing about the tidal wave of criticism that hit Facebook last week. It was not the company's crashing share price, or the spike in people googling &quot;delete Facebook&quot; that came with it. Nor was it the five days that it took Mark Zuckerberg to personally respond to the crisis, strange as the chief executive's silence was.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The curious thing was instead that many of the allegations levelled at the social networking giant were far from new. Facebook first faced accusations that it was failing to protect users' data in 2015, when newspaper reports emerged that a shadowy British data firm called Cambridge Analytica had harvested information from millions of profiles without their knowledge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back then few people had heard of the obscure analytics company, which had been tasked with boosting Ted Cruz's ultimately unsuccessful presidential campaign.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The claims were as serious as many of those made last week. But the story failed to reverberate around the world, nor did it cost the social network almost $60bn (&pound;42bn). The crucial difference is that while the facts have not changed, the world has.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are two important new factors. The first is that after Cruz's defeat in the Republican primaries, Cambridge Analytica struck up a relationship with Donald Trump, whose victory in the 2016 presidential election has invited near-constant allegations of impropriety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second is much more fundamental, and its ripples will be felt long after Trump leaves the White House: the world is becoming more anxious about the way its data is constantly collected, manipulated, and exploited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The string of cyber attacks that have seen billions of people's personal information stolen in recent years, combined with a growing distrust of Silicon Valley's internet giants and their creeping presence on everyday life, has been stoking tensions about data for months before last week's scandal. All it needed was one moment to trigger an eruption. Years from now, it may be remembered as Silicon Valley's &quot;financial crisis&quot; moment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The story of Facebook's Cambridge Analytica scandal begins in 2007, when Mark Zuckerberg's social media giant launched what it called the &quot;Facebook Platform&quot;. The feature allowed developers to create applications that would be linked to Facebook, such as games, quizzes and online accounts. The iPhone had yet to be released and online privacy was a concept that troubled few people - Facebook users would happily carry out entire conversations on each other's pages, which were often visible to the general public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Facebook grew, the number of apps that could connect to users' accounts and read their data grew with it. By 2012, there were 9m, and some of these, such as Farmville and Mafia Wars, had tens of millions of users. Around one in 10 apps were not only able to read the personal data of the people that had installed them, such as names, status updates and what pages they had liked, but also similar data about their Facebook friends. By reading friends' information, an app installed by just one person could harvest the data of hundreds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We thought that every app could be social,&quot; Andrew Bosworth, a senior Facebook executive who has been with the company since 2006, said last week. &quot;Your calendar should have your events and your friends' birthdays, your maps should know where your friends live, your address book should show their pictures.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The startling thing is that this was not viewed as strange at the time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Max Schrems, an Austrian privacy campaigner who has spent years challenging Facebook, said: &quot;Any app could pull all this data, there is no control over it whatsoever, and people agreed to it. Now they claim they have been betrayed and lied to. It's absurd.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2014, in response to privacy concerns, Facebook announced that it would stop apps getting access. But the damage had been done. Before Facebook blocked apps from accessing friends' data, around 270,000 people downloaded thisisyourdigitallife, a personality-testing app developed by Aleksandr Kogan, a Cambridge University academic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The power of Facebook's friend network had meant the app was able to gather data on some 50m users. Against Facebook's rules, which prohibited apps from passing on the information they had gathered, these details were then handed to Cambridge Analytica, which allegedly used them to run a sophisticated psychological advert targeting campaign that helped deliver Trump to the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Experts disagree about how true these dark arts are. Researchers have claimed that people's personalities can be determined using minor amounts of Facebook information - users who press &quot;like&quot; on the page of reality TV star Kim Kardashian, for example, are extroverts. Listing &quot;cooking&quot; as an interest is a sign one is conscientious.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These personality traits can then supposedly be used to show people customised online adverts that they will be most receptive to. A study last year found that psychological microtargeting made users 50pc more likely to buy something from an online advert.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others deride this idea as pseudoscience, and say nobody would believe in Cambridge Analytica's methods were it not for many people looking for a way to dismiss the legitimacy of Donald Trump's election victory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What was undoubtedly real was Facebook being thrown into crisis last week. Nine days ago it announced that it had suspended Cambridge Analytica, after discovering that the British firm had failed to delete the data when ordered to in 2015. This was followed by allegations from whistleblowers that the company had effectively no control over how data about its users was shared, leading the scandal to widen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sandy Parakilas, an operations manager at Facebook between 2011 and 2012, told MPs on the Commons digital, culture, media and sport (DCMS) committee last week that &quot;personal data was basically allowed to leave Facebook&quot; and that the company had never physically audited a developer that took data from it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Damian Collins, the committee chairman, said the company had &quot;turned a blind eye because it didn't want to find out the truth&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook's shares fell 11pc in four days, wiping $60bn off the company's share price. Mr Zuckerberg's personal wealth fell by $8bn, relegating him to merely the fifth richest person in the world behind clothing tycoon Amancio Ortega.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook has been through no shortage of scandals before. In the last year alone it has been buffeted by fake news allegations, claims that its addictive nature is harming mental health and of failing to combat terrorism on the site. But none of this appeared to affect the company's inexorable rise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It signed up 269m new users last year, a period during which its shares rose 53pc, and profits almost doubled, from $10.2bn to $18.2bn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week was different. Facebook may not face many direct financial consequences from the Cambridge Analytica crisis. The UK's Information Commissioner, Elizabeth Denham, is investigating Facebook and Cambridge Analytica. She was a thorn in the side of the company when running British Columbia's data regulator, but the maximum fine she can impose is &pound;500,000. America's Federal Trade Commission has greater powers if it judges that the company has broken the terms of a landmark 2011 agreement on data protection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There may be greater consequences, not just for Facebook but for all data businesses. European laws coming into force in May known as the GDPR will give regulators the ability to fine companies up to 4pc of annual sales for data violations, &pound;1.1bn in Facebook's case. Denham said last week that the regulator will soon have &quot;sharper teeth&quot;. MPs have now called for the Information Commissioner to have beefed-up powers that allows it to raid companies. &quot;This has shown the dark underbelly of data capture,&quot; says Julian Knight, an MP on the DCMS committee. &quot;The relationship needs to turn from 'you are the producer' [of data] to 'you are the owner'.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was the week the world changed,&quot; says Jonathan Kewley, a data privacy lawyer at Clifford Chance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kewley says the past 20 years has seen a &quot;data free-for-all&quot; in which a generation of consumers have given away their information too freely, partly because the privacy violations of past totalitarian regimes have been forgotten. It may have needed an event such as last week's to remind the world why it was important.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's taken us a while to go back to the reality of why privacy is important,&quot; Kewley says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zuckerberg appeared to admit the world had changed last week when he finally broke his silence, several days after the story emerged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am actually not sure we shouldn't be regulated,&quot; he said. He may get his wish.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Combative commissioner Teeth sharpened</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elizabeth Denham's investigation into how data from Facebook and elsewhere may have been misused for political purposes is not the first time the Information Commissioner has tangled with the social media giant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until she was appointed as the UK's top data regulator in 2016, the Canadian ran British Columbia's data regulator, as well as serving as Canada's assistant privacy commissioner, where she pursued Facebook over claims it was sharing users' data with third-party apps without consent, and that it held on to data even after people had deleted their accounts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since arriving in the UK she has also challenged Facebook after the social media giant began to share data between the social network and WhatsApp, the messaging app it acquired in 2014.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It led Facebook to stop sharing certain data between the two apps and sign an agreement promising to keep the data separate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Denham has used the full powers of her office in fining companies for data breaches, including a record &pound;400,000 fine for TalkTalk after the telecoms operator's 2015 data breach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She is now tasked with enforcing strict new data protection laws that give her more powers for fines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">$58bn value lost from Facebook's market cap</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Cambridge Analytica data harvesting scandal has wiped more than $60 billion off the value of Facebook and could be the catalyst that prompts governments around the world to crack down on technology companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They could subject them to the same rules and regulations that traditional media groups are obliged to follow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook is free to use and makes serious amounts of money from advertising. How it does that is by taking all of your data, your age, date of birth, likes and dislikes, who your friends are, what you do online and so on, analysing it and using the results to help advertisers target specific groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cambridge Analytica harvested the data of 50 million Facebook users, who were unaware that this was going on, and used that data to target them with political advertising. Naturally this has outraged politicians and privacy groups and led to Facebook being condemned for failing to protect its users' data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tough new restrictions on how companies store peoples' data, called GDPR, come into force in May in the UK and Europe. Do not be surprised if countries around the world in the weeks ahead go further and impose harsher restrictions on how Facebook and other technology companies use data. ? geoff.ho@express.co.uk</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Facebookhas endured a lot of backlash in the past few years due to the manipulation of the app and the role it may have played inBrexit's passing andAmerica's presidential election. With the tech company's involvement withCambridge Analytica, the cat is officially out of the bag.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What do Facebook's privacy infractions mean to you? Has your information been breached?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is Facebook safe any longer or was it ever? To answer these questions and others concerning Facebook selling personal information to Cambridge Analytica, I interviewed leading privacy advocate and CEO of MeWe, Mark Weinstein.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no way to use FB without giving up all your data. People forget or don't understand that Facebook is a &quot;data&quot; company and that is their true business. So even the facade of &quot;privacy&quot; settings on FB have absolutely nothing to do with their ability to spy on you and track everything you and your friends do. Facebook creates a data packet on you that may include 2,000+ points of information. And Facebook tracks their members across the Web - not just at Facebook but at thousands of sites. If a person wants privacy and data ownership - then Facebook is the wrong company to use.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Facebook is 'designed to exploit the brain and changes relationships', says man who helped create it                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the case of this Cambridge Analytica debacle, this is not a breach, not a hack, and not even an intrusion. This is Facebook being Facebook, selling data to anyone with the dollars to pay - think Russian election influence, etc. And in this case they sold personally identifiable data on 50-million members to supposed &quot;researchers.&quot; Yes, this is actually a serious breach by Facebook of their privacy policy - and of course that cat is out of the box - the data has ended up in the most nefarious of hands, and now those members are the perfect manipulation target. This is downright scary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the core of the Facebook data vacuum machine. These leaks of your data without your explicit permission are hard to contain because they have an immense data trove on everyone - and this data gold mine lives forever. It is your &quot;permanent digital record.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Imagine that every single thing you do online is captured by some algorithm and eventually ends up in a huge data packet about you. This is your digital footprint - every search, every person you connect with, all conversations, all purchases, your politics, religion, relationships, everything. A person's digital footprint will soon become the most important personal data they manage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People have been careless with their digital footprint because they didn't realize how pervasive and long-lasting the steps they've taken would become. People will want to get familiar with the phrase &quot;permanent digital record.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is what they are adding to with their digital footprint every time they post on Facebook or search on Google, etc., - because those companies watch and categorize everything you do. This will outlive you and likely in the future be discoverable by your employers, your significant others, schools, family members, friends, and more. Scary? Yes!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     'Cambridge Analytica HQ evacuated' and surrounding area sent into lockdown amid reports of a suspicious package                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The best defense is to immediately take yourself out of the Facebook data ecosystem. If you want true privacy then it's best to ditch Facebook. Facebook deletion is actually a very tricky process because they want your data regardless. Even when you delete your account they still serve your content that you posted previously in everyone's timeline that it was already posted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And here's something really creepy - if you delete your Facebook account they still track you across the Web and they still maintain a data packet about you, what you do, who you talk to, what sites you visit, what topics you search, and much more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regardless, the absolute best strategy is to terminate Facebook's ability to spy on you, delete your account and just move on - and get a fresh start with a privacy centric site like MeWe or another site that blocks all intruding algorithms and doesn't sell data or serve ads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: Just browsing the Web is now a bizarre experience because your ISP can spy on you and sell the data on everything you are doing - sites you are visiting, conversations you are having, purchases you are making, searches you are initiating. And Facebook is notorious for tracking both members and non-members alike across thousands of sites and aggregating what they learn into your permanent digital record for sale.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, people are best to install a privacy browser like TOR, use search engines that don't track like DuckDuckGo, and use social media sites that have privacy-by-design built into their platform like we've done with MeWe, with barriers keeping out snooping ISPs, Google, bots, etc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If history is the judge of how these data vacuums will behave under the auspices of GDPR, then we all should be very worried. Predictably, there will come a day when companies like Facebook and Google will have been discovered to have violated nearly every tenet of GDPR, all the while acting as though they'd complied. Uh oh!</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a puzzling thing about the tidal wave of criticism that hit Facebook last week. It was not the company's crashing share price, or the spike in people googling &quot;delete Facebook&quot; that came with it. Nor was it the five days that it took Mark Zuckerberg to personally respond to the crisis, strange as the chief executive's silence was.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The curious thing was instead that many of the allegations levelled at the social networking giant were far from new. Facebook first faced accusations that it was failing to protect users' data in 2015, when newspaper reports emerged that a shadowy British data firm called Cambridge Analytica had harvested information from millions of profiles without their knowledge.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back then few people had heard of the obscure analytics company, which had been tasked with boosting Ted Cruz's ultimately unsuccessful presidential campaign.&nbsp; The claims were as serious as many of those made last week. But the story failed to reverberate around the world, nor did it cost the social network almost $60bn (&pound;42bn).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The crucial difference is that while the facts have not changed, the world has. There are two important new factors. The first is that after Cruz's defeat in the Republican primaries, Cambridge Analytica struck up a relationship with Donald Trump, whose victory in the 2016 presidential election has invited near-constant allegations of impropriety.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second is much more fundamental, and its ripples will be felt long after Trump leaves the White House: the world is becoming more anxious about the way its data is constantly collected, manipulated, and exploited.&nbsp; The string of cyber attacks that have seen billions of people's personal information stolen in recent years, combined with a growing distrust of Silicon Valley's internet giants and their creeping presence on everyday life, has been stoking tensions about data for months before last week's scandal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All it needed was one moment to trigger an eruption. Years from now, it may be remembered as Silicon Valley's &quot;financial crisis&quot; moment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The story of Facebook's Cambridge Analytica scandal begins in 2007, when Mark Zuckerberg's social media giant launched what it called the &quot;Facebook Platform&quot;. The feature allowed developers to create applications that would be linked to Facebook, such as games, quizzes and online accounts. The iPhone had yet to be released and online privacy was a concept that troubled few people - Facebook users would happily carry out entire conversations on each other's pages, which were often visible to the general public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Facebook grew, the number of apps that could connect to users' accounts and read their data grew with it. By 2012, there were 9m, and some of these, such as Farmville and Mafia Wars, had tens of millions of users. Around one in 10 apps were not only able to read the personal data of the people that had installed them, such as names, status updates and what pages they had liked, but also similar data about their Facebook friends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By reading friends' information, an app installed by just one person could harvest the data of&nbsp;hundreds. &quot;We thought that every app could be social,&quot; Andrew Bosworth, a senior Facebook executive who has been with the company since 2006, said last week. &quot;Your calendar should have your events and your friends' birthdays, your maps should know where your friends live, your address book should show their pictures.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The startling thing is that this was not viewed as strange at the time.&nbsp; Max Schrems, an Austrian privacy campaigner who has spent years challenging Facebook, said: &quot;Any app could pull all this data, there is no control over it whatsoever, and people agreed to it. Now they claim they have been betrayed and lied to. It's absurd.&quot;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2014, in response to privacy concerns, Facebook announced that it would stop apps getting access. But the damage had been done. Before Facebook blocked apps from accessing friends' data, around 270,000 people downloaded thisisyourdigitallife, a personality-testing app developed by Aleksandr Kogan, a Cambridge University academic.&nbsp; The power of Facebook's friend network had meant the app was able to gather data on some 50m users.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Against Facebook's rules, which prohibited apps from passing on the information they had gathered, these details were then handed to Cambridge Analytica, which allegedly used them to run a sophisticated psychological advert targeting campaign that helped deliver Trump to the White House.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   Facebook and Cambridge Analytica | The story so far                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Experts disagree about how true these dark arts are. Researchers have claimed that people's personalities can be determined using minor amounts of Facebook information - users who press &quot;like&quot; on the page of reality TV star Kim Kardashian, for example, are extroverts. Listing &quot;cooking&quot; as an interest is a sign one is conscientious.&nbsp; These personality traits can then supposedly be used to show people customised online adverts that they will be most receptive to. A study last year found that psychological microtargeting made users 50pc more likely to buy something from an online&nbsp;advert.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others deride this idea as pseudo-science, and say nobody would believe in Cambridge Analytica's methods were it not for many people looking for a way to dismiss the legitimacy of Donald Trump's election victory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What was undoubtedly real was Facebook being thrown into crisis last week. Nine days ago it announced that it had suspended Cambridge Analytica, after discovering that the British firm had failed to delete the data when ordered to in 2015. This was followed by allegations from whistle-blowers that the company had effectively no control over how data about its users was shared, leading the scandal to widen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Sandy Parakilas, an operations manager at Facebook between 2011 and 2012, told MPs on the Commons digital, culture, media and sport (DCMS) committee last week that &quot;personal data was basically allowed to leave Facebook&quot; and that the company had never physically audited a developer that took data from it.&nbsp; Damian Collins, the committee chairman, said the company had &quot;turned a blind eye because it didn't want to find out the truth&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   How many people use Facebook                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook's shares fell 11pc in four days, wiping $60bn off the company's share price. Mr Zuckerberg's personal wealth fell by $8bn, relegating him to merely the fifth richest person in the world behind clothing tycoon Amancio Ortega.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook has been through no shortage of scandals before. In the last year alone it has been buffeted by fake news allegations, claims that its addictive nature is harming mental health and of failing to combat terrorism on the site. But none of this appeared to affect the company's inexorable rise. It signed up 269m new users last year, a period during which its shares rose 53pc, and profits almost doubled, from $10.2bn to $18.2bn.&nbsp; Last week was different.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook may not face many direct financial consequences from the Cambridge Analytica crisis. The UK's Information Commissioner, Elizabeth Denham, is investigating Facebook and Cambridge Analytica. She was a thorn in the side of the company when running British Columbia's data regulator, but the maximum fine she can impose is &pound;500,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There may be greater consequences, not just for Facebook but for all data businesses. European laws coming into force in May known as the GDPR will give regulators the ability to fine companies up to 4pc of annual sales for data violations, &pound;1.1bn in Facebook's case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   Profile | Elizabeth Denham                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Denham said last week that the regulator will soon have &quot;sharper teeth&quot;. MPs have now called for the Information Commissioner to have beefed-up powers that allows it to raid companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This has shown the dark underbelly of data capture,&quot; says Julian Knight, an MP on the DCMS committee. &quot;The relationship needs to turn from 'you are the producer' [of data] to 'you are the owner'.&quot;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was the week the world changed,&quot; says Jonathan Kewley, a data privacy lawyer at Clifford Chance.&nbsp; Kewley says the past 20 years has seen a &quot;data free-for-all&quot; in which a generation of consumers have given away their information too freely, partly because the privacy violations of past totalitarian regimes have been forgotten.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It may have needed an event such as last week's to remind the world why it was important. &quot;It's taken us a while to go back to the reality of why privacy is important,&quot; Kewley says.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zuckerberg appeared to admit the world had changed last week when he finally broke his silence, several days after the story emerged. &quot;I am actually not sure we shouldn't be regulated,&quot; he said . He may get his&nbsp;wish.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The movement for data rights has hit a landmark moment. In early 2017, I was instructed by a number of individuals who were concerned about the way their data was being used. They feared their personal data had been compiled and amalgamated into profiles based some on their most personal beliefs - their political opinions. Those profiles were processed by the notorious Cambridge Analytica, and seemingly by its parent company, SCL. We have now filed a claim in the British courts on behalf of a US citizen, David Carroll, to seek full disclosure of the data held by Cambridge Analytica and SCL. This will be the first case against these companies and will shed further light on what they were doing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our clients are seeking to understand the extent of the data held about them without their knowledge or consent, and to know whether that data was subsequently manipulated, and if so, in what way and for what purpose. They also hope to discover the breadth of information needed to make sophisticated predictions about political beliefs - a revelation that will be of wide interest, not just to our clients.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case will also determine something more fundamental: the boundaries of permissible use of personal political data. And in turn, our clients will seek to ensure that such sensitive personal information is in future better protected. While it is increasingly accepted in the digital age that individuals enter into a bargain with their data in using the internet, the true costs of this exchange are only now becoming clear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the context of revelations about what appears to be the untrammelled use of data in political campaigns, our clients' case will set the first train of accountability in motion. This case - and the movement behind it - is about more than just holding companies like Cambridge Analytica and SCL to account. It seeks to demonstrate the importance of data rights, and how steps can be taken to control the use of our own information. For too long, those rights have been ignored in the name of innovation.. This is a critical time in ensuring that individuals have a say in how their online worlds are governed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is now apparent that some information is too precious, too personal, to be left without personal control. After the claim was issued the Observer, the New York Times and Channel 4 News ran stories that have shown that our clients' concerns may be well placed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The whistleblower Christopher Wiley has revealed that Cambridge Analytica retained huge data sets on individuals, including data alleged to have been harvested from Facebook. Cambridge Analytica's own advertising claims that it possesses a unique set of 5,000 individual data points on each adult in America. That data was said to have been used to influence the US electorate through &quot;psychographic&quot; algorithms. Cambridge Analytica boasted that this algorithm had carried Donald Trump to victory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ultimate parent company of Cambridge Analytica, SCL, openly states that it has &quot;conducted behavioural change programmes in over 60 countries&quot;. It also claims to conduct &quot;military influence campaigns&quot; using &quot;alternative narratives and credible perspectives&quot;. The suggestion is that these companies could create a political consensus by influencing behaviour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Algorithms and machine-learning software are the new  &quot;weapons&quot; of political change. The internet is now full of algorithms that can analyse and predict human behaviour, even when information is incomplete. This has been achieved through the development of opaque software that, in the words of the Artificial Intelligence expert Fran&ccedil;ois Chollet, determines &quot;which articles we read, who we keep in touch with, whose opinions we read, whose feedback we get&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those who control algorithms have great power. In particular, decisions on what is promoted to the top of a newsfeed can have tremendous influence. The feeds people are shown on social media sites are highly personal. What you see in your feed is algorithmically tailored to your identity and your interaction history with the site. This is a potent tool for targeting individuals, exemplified by the revelations concerning Cambridge Analytica.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The idea that these platforms could evolve to affect politics goes against the idea of &quot;apolitical&quot; technology cherished by those in Silicon Valley. Indeed, it is only belatedly, and after the 2016 US presidential election, that the tech giants have revealed the extent of the manipulation of their use. Facebook initially labelled it &quot;crazy&quot;  that its platform could have any influence on the election. It eventually confirmed that it was able to identify 80,000 posts on its platform that it believes were linked to Russia, which were viewed by up to 126 million people during the campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The recent revelations about the extent to which Facebook data was seemingly abused by private companies has served to aggravate these concerns. The internet giants have been too slow to react when data breaches have been brought to their attention. The latest events should at least be an awakening for these companies to put data rights at the forefront of their platforms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While regulatory and legislative developments such as the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) may enhance individual protection over data, they represent an evolution in personal rights rather than a revolution. The revolution will come only when people can access and take control over their data and assert their rights to privacy, as our clients have done in their case against Cambridge Analytica and SCL.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As our lives increasingly translate into electronic media and data, the question of who controls our data and what rights we have over it is not just for regulators or to be to technology companies. It is becoming as fundamental to us as any other human right.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amid the uproar provoked by the alleged misdeeds of Cambridge Analytica, one could be forgiven for missing another important tech-related story this week. On Wednesday, the European commission announced its plans to introduce an EU-wide tax on large technology companies' revenues, as a response to their well-known practice of minimising their tax liabilities by shifting profits overseas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The idea of a tax on turnover isn't new, with the British, French, German, Spanish and Italian governments all having at various points considered one. But the EU is the first major political actor to put forward a concrete proposal. The commission has called for a 3% levy on internet-based firms with annual global revenues of at least &pound;658m and EU revenues of &pound;44m - thereby capturing giants including Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon. It expects this to raise &pound;4.3bn initially, a small amount but a good start nonetheless.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A tax on turnover clearly isn't the perfect solution. Most economists would agree that profit is a fairer basis for taxation than revenue, given that profit is essentially a form of &quot;rent&quot; that would not exist in a perfectly competitive market. In practical terms, too, it is less than optimal - one need only think of the startups that would be hit before managing to break even, or the promising companies in the process of scaling up that generate large revenues but also large losses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UK's ability to influence the tech titans is far greater as part of the world's second largest economy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The EU's proposal goes some way towards addressing these issues, however, by taxing only firms large enough to have acquired a dominant position in their markets. The commission has also described the proposal as an interim measure while a rational solution at the global level is worked out, which may take quite some time. The Liberal Democrats fully support this approach. As an internationalist party we strongly believe in global treaties, but we also recognise the need to act now to prevent the further erosion of the tax base. Acting through the EU would enable the UK to strike a balance by taxing the tech giants in tandem with our European neighbours, rather than resorting to unilateral action or waiting for the whole world to reach an agreement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I realise that this is made more difficult by Britain's impending departure. It is yet another reason why my party and I are campaigning for an exit from Brexit, by giving the public a vote on the final deal, with the option to remain. The EU has so far shown itself to be the only organisation bold enough to stand up to the tech titans, as evidenced by the hefty fines slapped on Google and Apple for anti-competitive behaviour and tax avoidance respectively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even if Brexit does happen, the UK should remain as close to the EU as possible by remaining in the single market and customs union and by maintaining regulatory alignment, including in our tax and competition policies. It is a simple matter of fact that the UK's ability to influence the tech titans is far greater as part of the world's second largest economy and a market of 500 million people, than as the fifth largest economy with a market of 65 million people. A common approach to tax is necessary if we want to stop global multinationals playing off jurisdictions against each other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ensuring that large tech companies pay their fair share of tax is just one part of challenging their dominance. The very serious allegations made against Cambridge Analytica involving data harvesting and microtargeting highlight the need to strengthen the control people have over how their data is gathered and used. Here again the EU is ahead of the curve with its general data protection regulation (GDPR), now finding its way into UK law, and its mission to create a digital single market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Facebook gave data about 57bn friendships to academic</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The phenomena of fake news and extremist content linked to the rise of social media also require a robust response. And competition policy will need to be rethought in a digital era where market dominance often can't be measured by high prices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We stand at a fork in the road. One path leads to a post-Brexit Britain in which a regulatory race to the bottom has left consumers with little control over their data and the government helpless in the face of multinationals' aggressive tax planning. The other path leads to a Britain either still in the EU or closely aligned with it, working alongside its continental neighbours to build a truly effective system for regulating and taxing the digital economy. I know which option I prefer.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                    As a small or medium business, it can be hard to keep track of all of the changes in legislation that will affect your company. However, there are a huge number of vital updates to note this year, and plenty that needs to be done to prepare. Here are five of the most important   .inline-content hl{     font-family: &quot;Austin News Deck Semibold&quot;, Georgia, Times, serif;      font-size: 1.7rem; }  .inline-content .first-letter{     color: ##d10a11;      float: left;     font-size: 9.1rem;     font-style: normal !important;     font-weight: normal !important;     line-height: 7rem;     margin-top: 4px;     padding-right: 2px;     text-transform: uppercase;     font-family: &quot;Austin News Deck Semibold&quot;, Georgia, Times,serif; }  1 GDPR</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For most companies, wide-ranging changes to data protection legislation will be one of the biggest issues. GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), comes into force on 25 May this year, and requires every business to take a long look at the current way they deal with the data they hold.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The legislation is extensive, but one of the most important aspects of it is the fact that you will need &quot;opt-in consent&quot; for everyone whose data you hold on your mailing lists. This means that most businesses will need to contact everyone whose data they hold to ensure that they are operating correctly, especially since the potential fine for breaching the regulations is 4pc of turnover.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's more information on the GDPR available at the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) at ico.org.uk .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2 National Living Wage increase</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The National Living Wage will rise to &pound;7.83 from &pound;7.50 on 1 April 2018 as announced in the 2017 Autumn Budget. That's a 4.4pc increase. The National Minimum Wage, which applies at varying rates to employees aged under 25, will also rise. For those aged between 21 to 24 the new rate is between &pound;7.05 and &pound;7.38 per hour. For those aged between 18 and 20 the rate is between &pound;5.60 and &pound;5.90 per hour. For those aged between 16 and 17, the rate will rise from &pound;4.05 to &pound;4.20 per hour. The rate paid to apprentices will rise from &pound;3.50 to &pound;3.70 per hour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Small and medium-sized business who do not pay the correct wage to their workers can be fined and named and shamed by the Government, and must pay any arrears immediately.[1]&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3 Publication of gender pay reports</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From 6 April 2018, it will become mandatory to publish information about the differences in pay between men and women. The information that you must publish is based on the gap between the two on 5 April 2017, and it is believed that that the Equality and Human Rights Commission could investigate employers who fail to publish the data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the smallest businesses are exempt from this, with those with fewer than 250 employees not required to publish data - although some business experts believe that this is still best practice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Government Equalities Office and ACAS have produced&nbsp; joint guidance on pay gap reporting &nbsp;and the Gender Pay Gap reporting website can be found&nbsp;here: gender-pay-gap.service.gov.uk .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4 Prohibition on corporate directors</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the implementation date on this piece of legislation is not yet clear, the Government is due to ban corporate directors - company directors that are corporate entities - this year. Directors will need to be &quot;natural people&quot;. Once the law comes into effect there will be a transitional period, expected to be a year, after which corporate directors will be banned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5 Brexit (EU Withdrawal Bill)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's the big one. The EU Withdrawal Bill, which aims to ensure that EU law no longer applies in the UK after the UK leaves the European Union, will be scrutinised throughout 2018, together with its subordinate legislation. Almost every aspect of this legislation, from the free movement of people to tariffs and debates around the Customs Union, is likely to affect the way small businesses operate. Although the law doesn't come into force until March 2019, it is vital for small and medium-sized businesses to understand the implications and to get planning early.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Patrick Cosgrove ( Letters, 21 March) argues that the answer to the Facebook data scandal is simple - stop using Facebook. Alas, this completely misses the point. A few of us have never been a member of Facebook, but they still hold data about us, gathered from our friends and family who do have Facebook accounts. Worse, given that Facebook also buys data about people from third-party brokers, the profile they have on us is probably far more detailed and complete than we might like to think. The Facebook AI systems may know where we live, where we used to live, our work history, quite a bit about our movements, the people we know, where and how often we meet, how rich or poor we are, our interests, political outlook and so on. This is not trivial. The more they know, the more they can deduce and infer - and the more that information can be abused when it falls into the wrong hands.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was said some years ago that the credit card companies had such good profiles of us that they could predict when a marriage was going to break up before the couple did. This may well have been apocryphal, but behavioural prediction has come a long way in the last few years. I have no doubt at all that this is now a prediction that can be made with a high degree of accuracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I studied cognitive science at postgraduate level 15 years ago. I took a special interest in AI, such as it was back then. The field has since changed beyond all recognition. The development curve is exponential. I suspect there are AI systems - perhaps belonging to Facebook or Google - that are performing feats that would have us all screaming for legislation if we knew about them. And if not today then certainly very soon. Robin PriorTyntesfield, Somerset</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&middot; The situation is more profound than a need to change the laws that regulate the web ( Editorial, 22 March). The web standards and structure have been created and moulded by corporations to suit their own purposes. As Lizzie O'Shea's article pointed out ( Time to cut ties with the digital oligarchs and rewire the web, 20 March), the rules of the internet need to be written by ordinary people, not corporations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I regularly contributed to the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), which sets standards for the web, and raised my concerns over approximately a decade, and their &quot;communities&quot; programme was one outcome. A primary difficulty is conceiving how one might engage ordinary citizens in authoring web standards; this is very dry, technical work. Jonathan ChetwyndLondon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&middot; Alex Hern ( Why have we given up our privacy so willingly ?, G2, 22 March) quotes Richard Stallman as saying &quot;I recommend a law prohibiting any system that collects data ... unless [the owner] can justify it as absolutely necessary for the function to be done&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is precisely one of the principles behind the forthcoming EU general data protection regulation (GDPR), which comes in to force on 25 May, at least in regard to personal data. Article 5 states that personal data shall be &quot;collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes&quot;; shall be &quot;adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed&quot; and shall be kept &quot;for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed&quot;. The collecting organisation is required to provide a clear privacy statement and supporting documentation to show how these principles are embodied in its data processing systems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As someone who has been advising a number of organisations on what they must do in order to demonstrate (and not just merely claim) compliance with the GDPR, I am quite impressed by the seriousness with which the authors of the regulation have taken privacy issues. I agree that it will need to be reviewed and updated on a regular basis, but as a starting point it is really very good. I just hope the regulator (the information commissioner, in the case of the UK) is as assiduous as the regulation deserves. John DobsonProfessor emeritus of information management, Newcastle University</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&middot; Appalling (and sleazy) as Cambridge Analytica's behaviour is, or was, I am puzzled by the hysteria over Facebook. Not being a teenager or someone who thinks food needs to be photographed for posterity before it can be digested, I have never had a Facebook account. But even a luddite like me finds it odd that anyone using Facebook thought their data was not being harvested. Exposing the guts of your life online and expecting that a free-to-use platform is not gleaning something is like eating burgers six times a day and being surprised that you get fat or smoking and being surprised that you end up with lung cancer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How lovely it would be if the same politicians who are on the current slam-social-media bandwagon had shifted themselves over the decades while the public was being fed bilge by the gutter press - paving the way for, among other things, Brexit. Amanda BakerEdinburgh</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&middot; One great advantage Ambridge Analytica ( Pass notes, G2, 22 March) has over Cambridge Analytica is that it doesn't have to rely on the doubtful truths to be found on Facebook to measure the mood of the residents of Borsetshire. It can analyse the grunts of Joe Grundy instead, a far more accurate guide. Keith FlettLondon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&middot; Apart from promising you that I am not the water-based wing of Cambridge Analytica, I'm happy to provide the number of the nearest bridge where I've moored for the night in support of your efforts to ensure that the Guardian letters page remains a troll-free zone ( Letters, 21 March). Ian GrieveGordon Bennett, near bridge 99, Shropshire Union canal</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&middot; I've tried to take Alex Hern's advice ( How to quit Facebook, 20 March) but every time I try to delete my Facebook account it &quot;times me out&quot;, meaning it's impossible to get out. Anyone else having this problem? Are we trapped for ever? Feels thoroughly dystopian. How to escape? Help! Jol MiskinSheffield</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&middot; Surely I am not the only person to believe that if God had meant us to use Facebook, He would never have&nbsp;given us email? Roger BackhouseYork</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four in ten Irish chief executives are not addressing cybersecurity breaches as they occur, according to research.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was one of the key findings in a global survey of businesses compiled by PwC, the professional services company, which showed a general lack of preparedness in relation to data management and security.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only half of business executives worldwide kept an accurate inventory of employee and customer data. A smaller proportion, 46 per cent, conducted compliance audits of third parties who handle customer and employee data on their behalf.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an Irish context, just 60 per cent of chief executives of Irish companies address security breaches as they arise. And just a third of EU-based firms have started an assessment of the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) to date. GDPR, which comes into effect in May 2018, applies to any organisation doing business in the EU. Companies will be liable for fines of up to (EURO)20 million, or 4 per cent of turnover, for non-compliance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pat Moran, cyber leader at PwC Ireland, said: &quot;GDPR is just around the corner and it is disappointing that the survey suggests organisations are not doing enough to protect data privacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added: &quot;Using data in more innovative ways opens the door to both more opportunities and more risks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In our experience, there are few companies building cyber and privacy risk management into their digital transformation. Understanding the most common risks, including lack of awareness about data collection and retention activities, is a starting point for developing a data-use governance framework,&quot; Mr Moran said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said companies should treat GDPR as &quot;strategic opportunity&quot; and not as a compliance drill.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Representatives of Facebook and the Irish data watchdog will be called before an Oireachtas committee to address concerns about the Cambridge Analytica scandal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Irish government has rushed to amend a new data protection bill since revelations about the activities of the British company, which obtained the data of 50 million Facebook users. The reports have wiped nearly $50 billion off Facebook's share price and investors are seeking legal action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday, the Oireachtas communications committee acceded to a request by the Green Party to invite representatives from Facebook and the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner (ODPC) to appear next month.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eamon Ryan, leader of the Green Party, said that Ireland was a key player in the regulation of online advertising and data protection because it is a European base for tech multinationals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While the activities carried out by Cambridge Analytica were outside this jurisdiction, Ireland's position ... puts us at the heart of this issue,&quot; he said. &quot;Ireland must lead the way on data protection and in how online activity, particularly advertising, is regulated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Having Facebook and the ODPC in to explain their role in this situation, and to see how we can proceed, will be very useful.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As concern grows around the world about Cambridge Analytica and its use of data to target voters, experts have warned that an upcoming Irish data protection bill includes a loophole that could allow a similar practice in the Republic.# Ireland is preparing to legislate for the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), an EU law on hosting and processing data. On Tuesday night, the government tabled an amendment to a section of the bill that would allow data processing for political purposes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The amendment would prevent multinationals from basing themselves in Ireland for data processing but processing would still be allowed for political groups based in Ireland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charlie Flanagan, the justice minister, said yesterday that it was important to ensure that there was &quot;no manipulation of voters, nor any undermining of the fundamentals of our democratic system&quot;, and said he was open to further amendments. On Tuesday, the ODPC said it was &quot;following up&quot; with Facebook, which has its European headquarters in Dublin, to see what kind of oversight it has of apps and third-party agencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The micro-targeting of social media users with political advertisements and sponsored stories &quot;remains an ongoing issue&quot;, the ODPC said, adding that it would be issuing guidance to users on ascertaining why they receive certain stories and advertisements on social media, and how to mute or turn ads off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How to delete a Facebook account</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before deleting or deactivating an account users should download a copy of all their data so that photos, posts and messages are not lost. This can only be done on a computer and is found in Settings, under Manage Account.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To deactivate a Facebook account, tap on the down arrow in the top right corner of a browser or the three lines in the bottom right corner of the app. Click on Settings and then General Account Settings page. Facebook will ask for a password and the reason for deactivating. This option is not permanent and an account can be restored at any time. All settings and personal data will be saved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook delays permanent deletion for a few days after the request is made and if a user logs on during this time the deletion is cancelled. To do so type https:// www.facebook.com/help/delete_account into a web browser and follow the steps in the instruction box. It can take 90 days for stored data to be deleted. The account cannot be accessed again but messages to friends will remain active. Copies of some material may remain in Facebook's database, but are &quot;disassociated from personal identifiers&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once an account is deactivated or deleted the app should be removed from all devices.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IT IS the story that has it all: a smooth-talking Old Etonian, a Russian academic, a pink-haired Canadian whistleblower, Donald Trump's estranged svengali, a Right-wing hedge-fund billionaire, a hard-nosed female watchdog, ex-Mossad agents... oh, and beautiful Ukrainian call girls. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Getty</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cambridge Analytica worked with Donald Trump and Ted Cruz on their presidential campaigns</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let's take them in order.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Old Etonian is Alexander Nix, 42, a financial analyst-turned-election strategist who in 2013 decided there was money to be made in America by microtargeting voters via cutting-edge social media analysis.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He decided to call the new business Cambridge Analytica - Cambridge because of the Cambridge University trained researchers who formed the backbone of the staff and Analytica presumably on the basis that anything Latin-sounding gave it a high-brow scientific air.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the company's services would stand or fall by the scale and quality of the data it drew on to fuel its services.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Step forward Dr Aleksandr Kogan, a psychology lecturer at Cambridge, who unbeknown to the university was also an associate professor at the Russian University of St Petersburg.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kogan owned a company called Global Science Research which was behind an app called &quot;thisisyourdigitallife&quot; that compiled personal information from people based on what they liked on Facebook.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of Cambridge Analytica's employees at the time was a Canadian called Christopher Wylie and he approached Kogan with a datamining proposal.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The upshot was that Kogan and Cambridge Analytica paid roughly 270,000 people to download his app and take a personality test.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE WASHINGTON POST / GETTY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Billionaire Robert Mercer and Steve Bannon backed Cambridge Analytica with $15million</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In doing so the participants not only consented to their data being collected for academic use but also the profile information of their Facebook friends.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In harvesting the personal details of 50 million American voters in this way, Cambridge Analytica acquired just the competitive edge that it was looking for - it now had all the data it needed to build a powerful software program to predict and influence choices at the ballot box Backed to the tune of some $15million by the American hedge-fund billionaire Robert Mercer and with Steve Bannon - the man who was later to become President Donald Trump's short-lived chief strategist - on board as vice president, the fledgling British outfit entered the US market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There it sold itself as what one commentator describes &quot;the ultimate hi-tech consultant, winning votes by using data to pinpoint target groups and designing messages to appeal powerfully to their interests&quot;.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It proved to be a highly seductive pitch - the company became involved in no fewer than 44 US political campaigns in 2014 alone.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By the time the Republican primaries got under way a year later Cambridge Analytica's status was such that it was hired by the presidential campaign of Texan senator Ted Cruz, one of the early front runners.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It divided voters into a set of six different types, from soccer mums to working dads, a process that enabled the Cruz camp to devise a variety of highly targeted direct-mail shots and digital ads, plus customised scripts for volunteers to use while contacting voters.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite this the Cruz campaign faltered.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But far from bowing out of the race Cambridge Analytica moved on to work for the man who was to go all the way to the White House: the Donald himself.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">YOUTUBE / CHANNEL 4 </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whistleblower Chris Wylie revealed data grab of 50 million Facebook profiles</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Election night 2016 was a triumphant moment for a British company that was just a few years old.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was not long before the vultures began circling.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In May last year Time magazine reported that Analytica was under investigation by the US Congress, linked to Russian attempts to influence the result of America's election.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By December it had been revealed that former FBI chief Robert Mueller had requested that Cambridge Analytica turn over the emails of all of its employees who worked on the Trump campaign as part of his own investigation into claims of Russian interference.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile Alexander Nix was summoned in front of the House of Commons' Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the course of his testimony in February he denied his company had made use of Facebook data, a statement that would return to haunt him.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But far worse was to follow.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By now Christopher Wylie, who had left Analytica in 2014, was feeling guilty about his involvement in an operation that had been unethical if not more despicable.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As he said this month: &quot;You are playing with the psychology of a country without their consent or awareness.&quot;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an epic piece of whistleblowing he told the whole story to a newspaper.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the story first broke on Friday, Facebook admitted it had known since 2015 that Kogan &quot;had lied to us and violated our platform policies&quot; by passing data to Cambridge Analytica and banned the company from its site.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Damian Collins MP, chairman of the Commons committee that had quizzed Nix about the Facebook issue, said: &quot;We will be contacting Alexander Nix asking him to explain his comments.&quot;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Elizabeth Denham, the government watchdog known as the Information Commissioner, announced on Monday that she was &quot;seeking a warrant to obtain information and access to systems and evidence&quot; in support of her own investigation.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just when Nix must have thought things couldn't get any worse Channel 4 News broadcast hidden-camera footage of an ill-advised meeting he and two colleagues had had with an undercover reporter posing as a representative of a wealthy Sri Lankan family seeking political influence.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The executives boasted about hiring Eastern European sex workers to seduce rival candidates and using intelligence-gathering organisations that employed former operatives of MI5, MI6 and Mossad to find &quot;all the skeletons&quot; in an opponent's closet.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They also talked about offering bribes to people willing to smear opponents as corrupt.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement addressing Channel 4 News' report the company came out fighting, arguing that the reporter had &quot;attempted to entrap Cambridge Analytica executives by initiating a conversation about unethical practices&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook page</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Personal data that appeared on Facebook was used to influence voters</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alexander Nix said: &quot;In playing along with this line of conversation and partly to spare our 'client' from embarrassment we entertained a series of ludicrous hypothetical scenarios.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am aware how this looks but it is simply not the case.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Cambridge Analytica does not condone or engage in entrapment or bribes or so-called 'honeytraps' and nor does it use untrue material for any purpose.&quot;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But while Nix, who was suspended as Analytica boss yesterday, and co try to get themselves out of the hole they have dug, there is another company which is arguably feeling worse.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook's market capitalisation, which was riding high at $538billion on Friday, had fallen to $479billion yesterday evening - a fall of a whopping $59bn.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook is on the ropes. A week of revelations about Cambridge Analytica's use of data gleaned from the social network has left the world demanding answers. The company can't seem to decide: is it outraged that it was taken advantage of by an unscrupulous actor, or relieved that this is just normal use of tools that it made widely available for almost five years? Should Mark Zuckerberg come out front and centre leading the response, or should he hide in a cupboard until it all blows over?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Faced with its first true crisis, the company is paralysed with fear. And that paralysis is, remarkably quickly, leading people to reassess their relationship with the site as a whole. The teens got there first, really. Facebook usage among younger people has been declining for years, in the face of competition from upstart rivals such as Snapchat, internal disruption from Facebook-owned Instagram, and a general sense that Facebook is full of old people and parents. But the backlash isn't a generational thing any more. We're all losing control of our data, both online and off, and we're starting to kick back.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not only is the burgeoning #deletefacebook movement picking up steam (although it will take a few weeks before hard numbers are available about how many have followed through on their words), but people are also beginning to look up, as if from a daydream, to ask: how exactly did we end up in this situation? Why did we give up our privacy so willingly? And how can we get it back?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  The Guardian view on big tech: a new era needs new rules | Editorial</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 50m profiles harvested from Facebook by a Cambridge Analytica partner under the guise of research are a huge data store, but they pale in comparison with the amount of information the company holds on its own users. At the same time that Facebook turned off the spigot that had been used to pump industrial quantities of data off its platform, the company opened up a second set of floodgates: the Facebook Audience Network, which allows third parties to track, profile and advertise to Facebook users wherever they find them on the internet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook isn't really a social network. It's barely even an advertising company. It's a data analytics firm, which manages to use its position as the middleman for a vast proportion of all human communication to find out everything there is to know about its users.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just as Cambridge Analytica claimed enormous powers of perception with a scant selection of personal information, Facebook also boasts to advertisers about how much it knows about its users - and how effective it can be at influencing their minds: it cites a games company that &quot;made video adverts to match different gamer styles&quot; for a &quot;63% increase in purchase intent&quot;; a clothes retailer that achieved &quot;a dramatic increase in sales&quot; with &quot;richly personalised ads&quot;; and a mobile network that scored &quot;a major boost in awareness and purchase intent&quot; by focusing on users with families. (Facebook used to have a similar page on which it showed off to politicians about how effective it was at swinging elections, but it quietly removed that in February.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you think you're a passive user of Facebook, minimising the data you provide to the site or refraining from oversharing details of your life, you have probably underestimated the scope of its reach. Facebook doesn't just learn from the pictures you post, and the comments you leave: the site learns from which posts you read and which you don't; it learns from when you stop scrolling down your feed and how long it takes you to restart; it learns from your browsing on other websites that have nothing to do with Facebook itself; and it even learns from the messages you type out then delete before sending (the company published an academic paper on this &quot;self-censorship&quot; back in 2013).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook boasts to advertisers about how much it knows about its users - and how it can influence their minds</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This data life isn't limited to Facebook. Google, famously, is in the same basic business, although the company is a bit more transparent about it (for a shock, try going to the &quot; My Activity &quot; and &quot; Location History &quot; pages to be vividly reminded that Google is tracking everything). And Amazon is building a modern surveillance panopticon, replete with an always-on microphone for your kitchen and a jaunty camera for your bedroom, purely to sell you more stuff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Avoiding the big players doesn't help much. Large data brokers such as Experian and Equifax exist to collate information about everyone, whether or not they're online. The security services continue to build their own surveillance databases, with powers strengthened in the UK through the recent Investigatory Powers Act. Even going to church now comes with the potential for a dose of surveillance: the Church of England has authorised the roll-out of 14,000 contactless card readers, to let parishioners give without carrying cash. Is it time to say goodbye to the anonymity of the collection plate, and hope you're one of the more generous donors?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Richard Stallman has been warning of this state of affairs since before Zuckerberg even touched his first computer. The veteran computer scientist, creator of the GNU operating system and leader of the Free Software Movement, warns that &quot;the only database that is not dangerous is the one that is never collected&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is a limit on the level of surveillance that democracy can co-exist with, and we're far above that,&quot; he tells me on the phone from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. &quot;We suffer more surveillance than the inhabitants of the Soviet Union, and we need to push it way down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Any database of personal data will be misused, if a misuse can be imagined by humans. It can be misused by the organisation that collects the data. In many cases, the purpose of collecting it is to misuse it, as in the case of Facebook, but also in the case of Amazon, Google to some extent, and thousands of smaller companies as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It can also be misused by rogue employees of the company and it can also be stolen by some third party and misused. There'd be no danger of data breaches if a database doesn't exist. And, finally, it can be taken by the state and misused.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stallman has little sympathy for those who choose to use such services. &quot;They're foolish,&quot; he says, when I ask him why he thinks data harvesting is tacitly accepted by so many people. &quot;They're accustomed to a certain kind of convenience... they choose to ignore that it might be dangerous.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm less certain that there's a choice being made at all, though. Yes, people may regularly be accepting terms and conditions that require them to give up their data, but that doesn't mean they read them. I should know: I have. A few years ago, I decided to read, in full, the small print for every single product or service I used. I read almost 150,000 words of legalese - three-quarters of Moby Dick - in less than a week, from the 21,000 words required to turn off the alarm on my iPhone on a Monday morning to the 4,000 words required to browse BuzzFeed in my lunch break.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The experience was gruesome. Legal documents are not written to be read by humans, and certainly not to be read back-to-back in a harrowing marathon of End-User Licence Agreements. But I did learn one thing, which is that the modern notion of consent upon which the entire data edifice is built has the shakiest of foundations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lukasz Olejnik, an independent security and privacy researcher, agrees: &quot;Years ago, people and organisations used to shift the blame on the users, even in public. This blaming is unfortunate, because expecting users to be subject-matter experts and versed in the obscure technical aspects is misguided.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Blaming users is an oversimplification, as most do not understand the true implications when data are shared - they cannot. You can't expect people to fully appreciate the amount of information extracted from aggregated datasets. That said, you can't expect users to know what is really happening with their data if it's not clearly communicated in an informed consent prompt, which should in some cases include also the consequences of hitting 'I agree'.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He adds that at many organisations, privacy was not being taken seriously, &quot;except when there was a need to include the phrase 'We take the privacy of our users very seriously' following a data breach&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The modern notion of consent upon which the entire data edifice is built has the shakiest of foundations</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It doesn't have to be like this. Doctors are required to demonstrate not just consent, but informed consent, from patients: the latter have to understand what they are agreeing to, or the agreement is moot. After years of mis-selling scandals, the same principle is slowly making its way to the financial industry. Logging in to check an ISA, you may be confronted with a 12-point questionnaire designed to check you understand the risks and are happy for the investment to continue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet online, the biggest companies in the world base their businesses around users hitting &quot;I agree&quot; on a dialogue box on a website once, a decade ago, and then never being told what their agreement entails, nor being offered any way to retract their consent and take back control of the information they gave up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Change is coming. In the EU, the General Data Protection Regulation - GDPR - overhauls a continent's worth of rules around a clear principle that the only person who can ever own an individual's data is that individual. Olejnik describes the law as a &quot;good starter&quot;, but notes that even it will still need to be &quot;reviewed and updated on a regular basis&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stallman wants to go one step further. &quot;I recommend a law prohibiting any system that collects data,&quot; he says, &quot;no matter who runs it, whether it's a company, some non-profit organisation, or a public agency, whatever, that they are not allowed to collect data unless they can justify it as absolutely necessary for the function to be done.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It would be a huge step, and one that is unlikely to come without a radical change in how the public views mass data collection. But he has hope, and rejects the label of a Cassandra, doomed with accurate predictions that will always be ignored.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know the future, because the future depends on you, so I'm going to try my damn best,&quot; he says. &quot;I'm a pessimist by nature. But just because things look dim, is no reason to give up. And that's what I've been saying for many, many years.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A new law is about to come into effect and according to experts you should be worried about your web presence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How much do you actually know about your privacy? What you're leaving behind?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     FacebookandGoogleknow so much about us, but we don't seem to know all that much about them. Not really.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mark Weinstein, founder of MeWe and cyber security expert told Mirror Online about the pitfalls of using the sites as well as why we should be worried about our privacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Don't fret though, knowledge is power.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It all centres on changes thanks to The European Union's (EU) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR, which comes into effect later in the spring.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A recent study shows that two-thirds of British adults haven't even heard of the law, while less than half are aware of new privacy laws on the horizon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prepare to be inundated with opt-in screens as you surf around the internet. Just remember, what might at first feel like a hassle will nevertheless represent a huge step forward in the data privacy war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even with GDPR, tech companies will still find ways to work around the system. Google and Facebook have been the most egregious violators of laws designed to reign them in and protect your privacy. When the European Court enabled Europeans to ask for the right to be forgotten against Google, that didn't mean anyone could just go online and sweep their information off. There was a process and procedure that a lot of people didn't want to bother with, proving that even with the best of intentions, there is no free ride for consumers. In four years, there have been approximately 650,000 requests covering the removal of 2.4 million URLs, with a little less than half accepted. And Google continues to fight skirmish after skirmish in many EU courts, challenging various aspects of the law and requests for data removal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So how will Facebook and Google try to skirt GDPR? First, they will offer the proverbial smokescreen. They will claim that they are making all the modifications and that there's nothing to worry about. But underneath, it'll be business as usual. Consider the seven likeliest scenarios below.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nest connects your home with a bunch of smart products such as thermostats, doorbells and smoke alarms. Making these products smart requires sensors collecting a lot of information about you. This is all part of the Internet of Things (IoT). According to GDPR, full transparency would require Nest to inform consumers how it uses the information it collects. Nest would say it uses this information to make its products smart. The more information it has, the smarter it becomes. The information it collects will only be used by Nest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Nest is owned by Google. Can't Google access that information? Yes. Uh. Oh. Another question here concerns mergers and acquisitions. If a fully transparent company gets bought out by a conglomerate yet maintains its individual identity, how does the larger company manage that information? Read on - here's your answer:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A few years ago, when Facebook bought WhatsApp, Jan Koum, the founder of WhatsApp, assured his users that their information would remain private and separate from Facebook's. He kept his word, for about 17 months - but what emerged then betrayed his promise - complete data sharing with Facebook of all WhatsApp members, including who they are, who they talk to, when they talk together, where they are when they talk, for how long, etc., plus tracking them across other apps and the Web . . .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So even if Nest for example, announces it may share consumer information with Google or its holding company Alphabet, who's going to monitor what gets exchanged within a company?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">VPNs were designed to offer an encrypted path on the internet that reduces the risk of eavesdropping. Many privacy advocates say having a VPN is a must these days for protection. Onavo offers a VPN service. It just released an app, Bolt App Lock, that lets you lock down any app you don't want others to be able to open. Facebook acquired Onavo in 2013. What could go wrong, right? When Facebook is involved, even privacy tools get manipulated. Bolt App Lock collects your mobile data traffic and gives Facebook a way onto your phone. Talk about a classic bait and switch. Facebook incorporates technology designed to protect users and then lulls users into a false sense of security while continuing its invasive ways. That's so Facebook.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apps and websites love writing things, like those &quot;War and Peace&quot; length explanations called 'Terms and Conditions'. Recently, consumer pressure forced tech companies to simplify their privacy policies. Facebook said it was going to use everyday language to tell it like it is. Google and Facebook would offer easy access to privacy check-ups. Don't be fooled by the bill of goods. They're perfect examples of trying to ride a wave of a revolution. With more and more people concerned about online privacy and their permanent digital record, these companies put on an empathetic face and suggest that &quot;we get you.&quot; They don't. The language may be simpler, perhaps even fully transparent, but that language is meant to protect them, not you. Companies define terms loosely when they want to stretch boundaries and very specifically when they want to avoid litigation. Even with GDPR's transparency, these companies will continue to work out ways to create gray zones where they can be simultaneously transparent and invasive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since its inception, Facebook has spent a lot of time designing and offering exciting new features. The tradeoff is you must give up your privacy to use them. Why? Privacy and features aren't inherently on opposite sides of the scales. It's companies like Facebook that manipulated it that way. In the end, people gave in to Facebook and other apps because they felt they didn't have any other choice. All their friends were using them so they had to as well. Even with GDPR, Facebook won't give up its way of doing business. Skin deep fixes yes, for compliance sake, but not an inch more. Facebook will make minimal changes not fundamental ones, no way. Even with full transparency, the company will never be fully transparent. And if the truth doesn't gibe with the company's bottom line, they'll find a way to bury it underneath the announcement of an amazing new feature. That feature would then be shown to be so amazing that users must have it, and they can, as long as they opt in. It's not a dishonest policy, but it is an immoral one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Full transparency may not be as full as it seems. If Facebook and Google tell you what they're doing with your collected information, they could still manipulate you by not fully defining what they don't do or claiming ignorance about what happens to your information when it gets passed to third parties. They could also claim actions they're taking may be invasive, but at the same time, will enable them to provide better service. That's not necessarily true. What does better service mean anyway? And better for who, probably not you. The reason people don't trust Facebook and Google is that they've taken so many actions to warrant that mistrust. You could say they deserve a second chance, but we're way past that, to the point they really can't and mustn't be trusted again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook and Google have been fined countless times for attempting to ignore or skirt around privacy laws in Europe. These are soulless companies only interested in revenue, proven time and again by their actions. In 2017 alone, The EU fined Facebook $122 million for giving misleading statements (blatantly lying) about keeping their hands off member data from its WhatsApp acquisition. France also fined the company almost $185,000 for failing to give French citizens proper control over their data and the Spanish data protection regulator hit Facebook with ~$1.4 million in penalties for a series of violations with its data-harvesting activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Google has a similar dismal history of dishonesty. In 2011 and 2013, France, Germany, and the U.S. fined Google with more than $7 million &quot;for the systematic, illegal collection of personal data while it was creating the Street View mapping service&quot; - in other words they literally stole the login and private passwords to everyone's home Wi-Fi networks. They were even fined $2.7 billion a few months ago for anti-trust violations - nothing is sacrosanct to them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's not that the fines don't upset these companies. It's that they can financially easily withstand them to continue their questionable practices. For them, privacy penalties and other fines aren't about ethics. They have none. They're merely the price of doing business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Facebook and Google have spent millions challenging every new privacy law enacted in Europe. In 2017, Google challenged France enforcement of the 'right to be forgotten' rulings as it has done in England in 2018. In other words, even when a major ruling goes against the company, Google will fight on to limit the scope of such acts. Facebook regularly has sent teams of lobbyists to Brussels to fight similar rulings and definition of laws. In its eyes, it may lose a privacy battle, but it will do whatever it takes to win the war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bottom line here, regrettably, is the bottom line. GDPR is great for people, but a challenge for Facebook and Google, who not only don't care about your privacy - they also profit on your loss of it and only care about their bottom lines. So if an inconvenient privacy law arises, such as GDPR, the one thing that is guaranteed is that both companies will surely violate the law repeatedly, while continuously challenging the law in the courts, at the same time paying the fines levied as a business expense, while doing their best to circumvent GDPR and continue to violate your privacy and exploit your information.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the fallout from the Cambridge Analytica revelations rumbles on, there's gathering momentum behind a social media campaign urging people to delete their Facebook account.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By way of a quick primer: it turns outFacebook data for around 50 million profiles was harvested by a company in order to target audiences with political advertsaround Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign and the Brexit vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fact that Facebook allowed this to happen in the first place is bad enough, but then it failed to alert users and and didn't do much in the way of securing that personal data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, of course, the company is scrambling to reverse the damage and salvage some reputation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     #DeleteFacebook campaign sweeps cyberspace following Cambridge Analytica revelations - here's how to delete your account                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a terse statement this week, the social network &quot;is committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people's information.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook said: &quot;We are constantly working to improve the safety and experience of everyone on Facebook. In the past five years, we have made significant improvements in our ability to detect and prevent violations by app developers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The data was harvested through an app called &quot;thisisyourdigitallife&quot; and was downloaded by 270,000 people which got the developer - Dr. Aleksandr Kogan - access to people's information that he then sold to Cambridge Analytica.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Facebook, Cambridge Analytica, Donald Trump and the data breach accused of threatening democracy                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When you sign up to Facebook for free, you consent to them using your data for things like advertising and profiling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When you sign up to an app and use your Facebook log-in, that app also gets to see your data. And if it outsources to a third-party, very often they get a look-in as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a feature called Facebook Connect and it's a very efficient way of getting people like you and me to voluntarily hand over our data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm not just talking about the photos you post or your status updates, either. Things like location, IP address, device and contacts are also recorded and constitute personal data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     All these organisations have the power to view your internet browsing history without asking                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Are you actually, hand-on-heart going to delete your Facebook profile?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I suspect not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since 2006 - when it first migrated beyond universities - Facebook has insinuated itself in our lives. For most of us, it has become our online address book, photo album and event planner that we carry with us at all times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A company doesn't hit over two billion users and $40 billion of annual revenue without giving people something they want.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I personally use Facebook a lot less now than I ever did before - partly because I'm not at university any more and partly because I just can't be bothered. But I still keep it around because it's inherently useful. I've been invited to a party this weekend - not through a text, email or phone call - but on Facebook.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even while younger people migrate to the likes of Snapchat and Instagram, Facebook is still the place they can drop a birthday message to an uncle or aunty or check in to see what someone at school looks like now. It's also useful if you belong to a community or group that share your interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taking away this ability wouldn't dramatically impact your life (trust me) but for the vast majority of people it's just too convenient to keep it around.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And what's more - if you're going to delete Facebook you had better make sure you delete Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp as well - because Zuckerberg owns them all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     How to unsend WhatsApp messages and other tips and tricks: the ultimate guide to the global chat app                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You might be forgiven for thinking that when GDPR comes into force in May, we'll be able to have our cake and eat it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is - continue to use Facebook whilst keeping control of our personal data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Again, I'm sceptical.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For starters, the Regulation states that lawful processing criteria for personal data includes that which is manifestly made public by the data subject - that's you. And that's what any social media company with a half-decent DPO will argue right off the bat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And even though the criteria for consent has been tightened up, Facebook (and Google and Amazon and the rest) will be within their rights to say processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party - in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering the contract.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So while the EU is tightening up it's principles to deal with social media, I'm not sure I'd bet against the legal army the tech giants will be able to mount in the face of it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mark Weinstein, one of the world's foremost privacy advocates, told Mirror Tech: &quot;Even with GDPR, Facebook won't give up its way of doing business. Skin deep fixes yes, for compliance sake, but not an inch more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Facebook will make minimal changes not fundamental ones, no way. Even with full transparency, the company will never be fully transparent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And if the truth doesn't gibe with the company's bottom line, they'll find a way to bury it underneath the announcement of an amazing new feature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What we can hope is that the privacy policies are made clearer and more transparent so at least those without a law degree can understand what's going on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By the way - just a quick aside here - even the guy who co-founded WhatsApp is saying he's going to delete Facebook:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brian Acton</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anyway, if you're committed to #DeleteFacebook, here's how you do it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Log in to Facebook, and go to Settings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Next to 'Manage Account', click edit, and then 'Request account deletion.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You'll then have 14 days to undo the process before your account is permanently deleted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you want to keep a copy of your photos and information, make sure you download a copy of your Facebook data in the General Account Settings area before deleting your account.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     What is Vero? The 'Facebook Killer' app that's become so popular it's CRASHING in parts of the UK                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook also offers the chance to deactivate your account - which means very little because you can just reactivate it at any point down the line by logging in again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even with full-on deletion, there are some caveats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook states:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Copies of some material (example: log records) may remain in our database but are disassociated from personal identifiers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having your data anonymised is a start - and again, will mean Facebook can comply with GDPR - but it still means it can use the information in bulk to shop to advertisers and think tanks and researchy types.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also - be aware that anything you've logged into with Facebook: Spotify, Netflix, Airbnb (take your pick) will need to be reconfigured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     How to keep your computer safe from hackers and cyber attacks                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No, not really.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook provides an incredibly valuable service to millions of people and it has quite rightly earned a gazillion pounds for doing so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company has set up an amazing technical infrastructure, provided loads of jobs to people and is evendeveloping drones to bring the internet to less economically developed countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the prospect of working at Facebook has inspired even a single student to take up an STEM course or delve deep into PHP programming, then it should be congratulated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But we also have to take it for what it is - a company committed to its shareholders and employees as much as its customers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Don't be surprised when it takes efforts to protect itself or maximise its commercial prospects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There will rightly be fallout from Cambridge Analytica but this is by no means the end for Facebook. My hope is that it serves to educate people about how the company works and just how valuable their personal data is in the grand scheme of things.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also: don't say you're going to delete Facebook just to get on the #bandwagon if you're still secretly planning to check your news feed and stay connected to your BFFs through Messenger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While we're at it - don't doany of these things on Facebook.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the meantime, if you need me, I'll see you onMySpace.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sorry to break it to you, but you are probably a &quot;dumb fuck&quot;. This is according to statements by a young Mark Zuckerberg anyway. Back in 2004, when a 19-year-old Zuckerberg had just started building Facebook, he sent his Harvard friends a series of instant messages in which he marvelled at the fact that 4,000 people had volunteered their personal information to his nascent social network. &quot;People just submitted it... I don't know why... They 'trust me'... dumb fucks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Are you leaving Facebook? Share your concerns on privacy with us</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fourteen years later, the number of people who have trusted Zuckerberg with their data has grown from 4,000 to 2 billion. Zuckerberg has also grown, or so he would have you believe. In a 2010 interview with the New Yorker, the Facebook founder said he regretted those early messages. &quot;If you're going to go on to build a service that is influential and that a lot of people rely on, then you need to be mature, right? I think I've grown and learned a lot.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When it comes to respecting and safeguarding the information people have given him, however, has Zuckerberg really learned that much? Recent events suggest not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Saturday, the Observer revealed how Cambridge Analytica, a company funded by conservative billionaire Robert Mercer, acquired and exploited the data associated with 50m Facebook profiles. It appears that while Facebook had been aware of what the Observer described as &quot;unprecedented data harvesting&quot; for two years, it did not notify the affected users.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What's more, Facebook has displayed a remarkable lack of contrition in the immediate aftermath of the Observer's revelations. Instead of accepting responsibility, its top executives argued on Twitter that the social network had done nothing wrong. &quot;This was unequivocally not a data breach,&quot; Facebook vice-president Andrew Bosworth tweeted on Saturday. &quot;People chose to share their data with third party apps and if those third party apps did not follow the data agreements with us/users it is a violation. No systems were infiltrated, no passwords or information were stolen or hacked.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a sense, Facebook's defence to the Cambridge Analytica story was more damning than the story itself. Tracy Chou, a software engineer who has interned at Facebook and worked at a number of prominent Silicon Valley companies, agrees that there wasn't a hack or breach of Facebook's security. Rather, she explains, &quot;this is the way that Facebook works&quot;. The company's business model is to collect, share and exploit as much user data as possible; all without informed consent. Cambridge Analytica may have violated Facebook's terms of service, but Facebook had no safeguards in place to stop them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  'Utterly horrifying': ex-Facebook insider says covert data harvesting was routine</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While some Facebook executives were busy defending their honour on Twitter over the weekend, it should be noted that Zuckerberg remained deafeningly silent. On Monday, Facebook's shares dropped almost 7%, taking $36bn (&pound;25.7bn) off the company's valuation. Still, Zuckerberg remained silent. If you're going to build a service that is influential and that a lot of people rely on, then you need to be mature, right? Apparently, silence is Zuck's way of being mature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But forget how the folks at Facebook are reacting to this - still unfolding - PR crisis. If you're one of the social network's 2 billion users, how are you reacting? Have you deleted your account in protest? Are you angrily sharing articles about the fiasco on Facebook but continuing to use the service? Have you shrugged and moved on?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For my part, the Cambridge Analytica story was the nudge I needed to finally cut ties with the social network. I've been trying to extricate myself from Facebook for a long time. My uneasiness with the network largely stems from the fact that I used to work in advertising and, for years, was on the receiving end of many a sales pitch from Facebook, Google and other companies that have built businesses trading in users' data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Funnily enough, the likes of Facebook deliver a very different narrative to marketers than they do the wider public. They downplay their significance when challenged by the media about, for example, their influence on the 2016 US election. They downplay their power to deal with online harassment or the spread of fake news. However, if you've got an advertising budget and want to know how Facebook can persuade your target consumer to buy your product, it's a different story. Suddenly, Facebook is an all-knowing entity with unrivalled information; it can get almost anyone to do almost anything. While Facebook presents itself to the public as a social network, when addressing the advertising industry, it is very clear about the fact that it's a surveillance system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Learning just how much Facebook knew about its users put me off using the network. But while I stopped actively using Facebook and its suite of apps, including Messenger and Instagram, years ago, it's only recently that I decided to delete my account. Before taking the plunge, however, I downloaded an archive of all the data I had put on Facebook. There's an option to do this when you go to Facebook's settings. It's easy and I highly recommend it. Seeing years' worth of data neatly arranged serves as an important wakeup call as to the extent of the information you have handed over to the company. Even then I was loath to get rid of my account altogether; just in case I needed to contact someone or check something. But on Monday, having witnessed Facebook's refusal to take any meaningful responsibility in regards to the Cambridge Analytica story, I deleted my account in disgust.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To be clear: I'm not recommending that you do the same. In many ways, being able to distance yourself from Facebook these days is a privilege. As Safiya Noble, an assistant professor of information studies at the University of Southern California and the author of Algorithms of Oppression, notes: &quot;For many people, Facebook is an important gateway to the internet. In fact, it is the only version of the internet that some know, and it plays a central role in communicating, creating community and participating in society online.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even if you've got multiple ways to communicate and participate in society online, there is not really a good replacement for Facebook. There's no one portal that reminds you of your friends' birthdays, connects you to relatives across the world and stores photos from 10 years ago. Deleting Facebook inevitably means missing out on certain things and having to make more of an effort to connect with people in other ways.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What's more, unless you delete Facebook's entire ecosystem of apps, including Instagram and WhatsApp, you aren't safeguarding yourself from the company's data-collection practices. I haven't brought myself to delete WhatsApp, for example, because I still think that the benefits of using that outweigh the privacy tradeoffs. Nor have I fully deleted Instagram, which is just as nefarious as Facebook. Deleting my Facebook account may have some way to protecting my sanity, but it has done little to minimise my digital footprint.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Noble stresses, &quot;deleting individual Facebook accounts will not solve the total datafication of our lives&quot;. While deleting your account may give you some temporary satisfaction, it has &quot;little impact on finding real solutions to the way data is being collected, sold, and used against the public. This issue isn't just about one platform like Facebook, and the issues of surveillance and experimentation on the public, it's about the many companies that are tracking and profiling us, and the abuses of power that come from having vast troves of information about us, available for exploitation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other data experts echo Noble's view. As Frederike Kaltheuner, who leads the data exploitation programme at the charity Privacy International, explains: &quot;You can delete your Facebook, but you will still be tracked in your online and increasingly also your offline life. Mobile phones are by definition a tracking device.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The recent revelations about Cambridge Analytica are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to how our data is being used and abused. This can not be stressed enough. The internet is increasingly a worldwide web of corporate surveillance and it's impossible to piece together a complete picture of how your personal information - both your online and offline data - is being utilised. While behemoths such as Facebook are guaranteed to make headlines, there's a lot less media scrutiny of the thousands of other companies that make a living out of extracting and exploiting your personal life in extremely dubious ways.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The software company Pixoneye, for example, is far from a household name. But if you have granted an app permission to access your photos in the past, there's a good chance you have allowed it to utilise Pixoneye's tech. This scans the photos on your phone and uses the data it extracts to create a story of who you are. It might characterise you as someone who watches sports, for example, or as wine-drinker who enjoys lots of family holidays. Your photo gallery offers a staggering amount of insight: as the CEO of Pixoneye wrote in an op-ed last year : &quot;Our smartphone image galleries have in many ways become a reflection of our lives ... each image you have stored contains a range of data attributes and meta tags that not only reveal your past purchasing profile, but can also be the key to predicting what purchases you're likely to make in the future.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, you might be thinking, an app knows I like wine, and uses that information to sell me stuff. What's the big deal? In isolation, not much. But, as Kaltheuner stresses, &quot;when combined, data can reveal a lot&quot;. Bringing together multiple data sources is &quot;how data-brokers have information such as personality profiles and relationship statuses&quot;. The more data points you have, the more you can predict. As the Cambridge Analytica investigation revealed, even a few dozen Facebook &quot;likes&quot; can strongly predict someone's sexual orientation, or the political party they are most likely to vote for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you're starting to feel jittery about the exploitation of your personal data but aren't ready to delete social media and go and live off the grid, there are some simple steps you can take to mitigate your digital footprint. &quot;We should all do a little digital spring cleaning,&quot; advises Leila Hassan, head of analytics at the London branch of Ogilvy, a global advertising agency. &quot;Check what [third-party apps] you've enabled through your social channels. I'll bet most of us still have things enabled from years ago.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In order to examine the apps you have enabled through Facebook, go to settings and click &quot;Apps&quot; on the left sidebar. When I did that I was somewhat alarmed to find that I had given 68 apps indefinite access to my Facebook data. Even more alarmingly, accounts I had deleted ages ago - such as the dating app Bumble - still seemed to have access to my Facebook information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once on this page, it's easy to revoke permission for particular apps to access your data. It's much harder, however, to view or remove the data they have already collected. Facebook informs you that you should &quot;contact the developer of the app&quot; if you want to get rid of the data they have collected. I didn't really feel like contacting the developer of 68 different apps before deleting my Facebook account so I am unclear about the fate of the data they have amassed. Presumably it's all floating around in the cloud somewhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Delete your account - a guide to life after Facebook</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What else can you do to try and minimise your digital data trail? Jim Killock, from Open Rights Group, an organisation that works to protect the right to privacy online, suggests &quot;posting less, sharing less and, most importantly, removing page 'likes' as these are a major way [Facebook tries] to profile you&quot;. Killock further suggests using &quot;privacy plug-ins to block Facebook cookies, and cookies from other websites, which they all use to keep a record of the sites you visit, and making extra, 'fake' accounts&quot;. But Killock stresses that while it's important that people are more cognisant of their online behaviour, &quot;regulators must also act&quot;. So must companies. &quot;At Privacy International, we want companies to do better and protect privacy by default, rather than users having to become full-time data protection experts in order to have their basic rights protected,&quot; says Kaltheuner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The good news is that regulators are slowing starting to act. On 25 May, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is going to come into effect. This is an important step in shifting the balance of power, when it comes to data, away from companies and back towards individuals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kaltheuner notes that a key point of the new legislation is that it is extraterritorial. &quot;This means that if you are a company based outside the EU (for example in the US), and are offering goods or services to, or monitoring the behaviour of individuals in the EU, you must comply with it. This is especially important in countries, such as the US, with no comprehensive data protection regime.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the GDPR is an important step towards giving people control over their data, it's far from a cure-all. It is no exaggeration to say we are teetering on the edge of a data dystopia. Just look at China, where the government recently announced that it will ban people with poor &quot;social credit&quot; from travelling on planes and trains. And it's not just China where oblique algorithms are determining the direction of our lives. The recent revelations about Cambridge Analytica are an important wakeup call that we are all living with the sociopolitical consequences of surveillance capitalism. We can't just sit back and hope that regulation will save us. We can't just click and like and share as usual and hope something will eventually change. We are, I think, at a critical moment where the degree of corporate surveillance to which we are all subjected can either get much better, or much worse. So, I would urge you to extricate yourself from social media as much as you can. Deleting your Facebook account may not put an end to the surveillance state, but it sends an important message to big tech that we don't trust them any longer.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A loophole in a proposed data protection law may open up Ireland to legal challenges, a privacy campaigner has said. Max Schrems, who is in a battle with Facebook Ireland over the use of its personal data, said that Ireland was involved in a &quot;race to the bottom&quot; with other EU member states in the list of exemptions in its Data Protection Bill 2018. The bill is the legal expression of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), an EU law on hosting and processing data, which will come into force on May 25. All EU member states are required to have a GDPR implementation law. Included in section 43 of the Irish bill is an exemption from a prohibition on processing data relating to political opinions, which would allow data to be shared so long as it is for a candidate, political party or state agency. &quot;Many members states have outrageous exemptions from GDPR and I think many of them would not hold up in court because EU law overrides national law,&quot; Mr Schrems said. &quot;The countries are trying to get away with things and the Irish exemption is definitely problematic. Some countries have had to rewrite their law multiple times because they did not comply.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Schrems said None of Your Business (NOYB), a non-governmental organisation he founded last year, has raised (EURO)300,000 to cover legal challenges to loopholes such as those in the Irish bill. He said NOYB would &quot;collectivise enforcement&quot; so that citizens will not feel daunted about taking cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The objective is to kill the loopholes and set precedents so other countries have to follow suit.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Making the decision to quit professional rugby after one year playing for Connacht Rugby was hard for Tommy Kearns but he took much of what he had learnt on the pitch into business, not least an ability to push on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I had to make a decision about whether to keep going and try to make the Irish team, or not,&quot; he said. &quot;Either way I had no regrets, it was a great thing to have done. I learnt so much about focus and teamwork, and I made friends for life.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He headed first to Jamaica, working for former publisher Mike Hogan's mobile marketing business. It was 2002, a time of ringtone crazes, with TV shows emerging that required voters to text a preference. Kearns lapped it up, subsequently moving to Mexico to head up a similar company there from 2003 to 2006, &quot;the good years for SMS&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He returned to Ireland, cofounding app and games developer iMobile in 2009. It created games such as Street Rugby as well as apps for the IRFU and Leinster Rugby.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over three or four years, we built more than 300 apps but a lot of clients were saying, so we've built the app, now what? At the time there was an awful lot of brochureware.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problem was ensuring brands could communicate with the users, and smartphone data was emerging as the solution. &quot;SMS was very spammy and was all about 'spray and pray',&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Data analysis boosted the odds considerably. &quot;We saw a big gap in the market for a platform, from which all apps could communicate with users across all channels, be it a shop's ecommerce app, a rugby club looking for engagement with fans, or a news site putting out breaking news.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Xtremepush is a one-stop shop for digital communications including helping brands to find the right audience, to delivering the right in-app messaging, to providing insightful analytics afterwards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If I'm reaching about sport, politics and business, I don't want to receive information about lifestyle matters, for example,&quot; said Kearns. &quot;We help brands understand their users on web or app, across all channels, whether it's messaging or email or pop-ups.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Understanding people's online behaviour helps too, and it can be as simple as knowing what device they are likely to be on at what time. &quot;During the day it's the laptop, in the evening it's all about the iPad and apps,&quot; said Kearns, who reckons Xtremepush is one of just 10 companies worldwide that take an omnichannel approach and owns its own &quot;technology stack&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Xtremepush doesn't need to bring in sub suppliers to deliver activities across different channels. With tougher penalties on the way for data and cyber breaches as a result of the EU's new General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR), that has become a key selling point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier this month it acquired Emailcenter UK, doubling total head count to 40 immediately, with a further 20 staff to be added over 18 months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UK email marketing business was founded in 2001 and was, he said, an early innovator in the field of email marketing. Its proprietary email technology was the missing link in terms of Xtremepush's suite of services. Having sorted the technology, the biggest challenge now is integrating the two businesses culturally. The Irish side of the house is still in its early stage growth phase, while Emailcenter UK brings the kind of robust systems and processes that go with being longer established.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brexit holds no fear for him. &quot;Yes there's an element of wait and see but at the same time brands are always going to need the type of communications services we offer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He recently beefed up the team, with John Hartnett, chief development officer with Paddy Power Betfair, and Bryan Carroll of iConnect 101, a digital banking specialist, coming on board as non-executive directors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The ambition is to exit in three to five years at an equity valuation of (EURO)100m.&quot; Not a bad result.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you're sick of hearing how artificial intelligence (AI) is going to take over the world, good news. The geeks who claim computers will do everything - including your job - may be about to get their comeuppance.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It comes in the form of a dull-sounding bit of EU legislation. The general data protection regulation (GDPR) forces companies to take far more care of our personal data, and it's backed by billion-euro fines. But tucked away is small print that could cost the tech giants far more. It allows citizens to challenge any computer-based decision and insist on an explanation in plain language.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is bad news for the geeks: they rarely have a clue what is going on inside those black boxes. Sure, they know how to program computers to behave like vast arrays of brain cells. They can explain how the resulting neural network can spot patterns in data. But if you ask them why, say, it rejected your loan application, the explanation will be like the line from Little Britain: &quot;Computer says, 'No'.&quot; As of May 25, when the GDPR comes into force, that won't cut it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Computer scientists have long been aware of AI's dirty secret. They all have their favourite story - such as the one from Pittsburgh University, which built a system to decide which hospital patients were most at risk of dying from pneumonia. They gave the AI vast amounts of data, and left it to work its magic. Sure enough, it made an astonishing discovery - patients with asthma were at low risk of dying from pneumonia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The AI couldn't explain this bizarre link, but researchers could. Asthmatics are actually at much greater risk, so doctors send them straight to intensive care, which increases their chances of survival. The AI blundered because it knew nothing beyond the data. Computer scientists find that the more reliable an AI system is at making decisions, the harder it is to explain them. They need to find answers quickly, before AI ends up in a place familiar to humans who can't account for their actions: a courtroom ? n Robert Matthews is visiting professor of science at Aston University, Birmingham</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DON'T PANIC: YOUR PROBLEMS SOLVED Since updating my iPad's software my printer produces only miniature versions of pages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Help! PW, via email Because you are outputting either thumbnails - tiny previews - or greatly reduced pages, you can't be sending jobs to a printer that works with Apple's AirPrint. This is the simplest way to print from an iPad or iPhone, as the only choices it offers users are colour/B&amp;W and single/doublesided. So, assuming you do not own an AirPrint-enabled printer (all the big names make them), you'll need to dig into the app or service you're using to adjust its print settings. For best non-AirPrint results, send jobs to a printer using an app from its maker: Canon, Epson and HP all offer free software for iOS.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This means that out there, somewhere, is a list of every single website and instant messaging apps that you have visited or used in the past 12 months,reports Daily Post.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These agencies have full access to anything you've ever searched, should they require it - whether you want them to or not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Data firm behind Donald Trump and Brexit campaigns suspended by Facebook for 'harvesting 50 MILLION profiles'                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However you needn't panic if someone you know works for one of these organisations as the law stipulates the lowest rank each person must be to be able to gain access to the records.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So for instance, in the police, anyone requesting access must be at least an inspector or a superintendent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bill seems to be contradictory to government plans to strengthen UK data protection law, giving citizens more control over their personal information - including what they share on social media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the newData Protection Bill, individuals will have the &quot;right to be forgotten&quot;, meaning they will be able to make websites like Facebook delete information - including content published in their childhood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Facebook to be forced to delete your information on demand under new law                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Matt Hancock, Minister of State for Digital, said the measures are designed to &quot;give consumers the confidence that their data is protected and those who misuse it will be held to account&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed to overturn peers' changes to the bill, which is currently being reviewed by a Public Bill Committee in the House of Commons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If passed, the Data Protection Bill will bring British law into line with the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which will become enforceable from May 25, 2018.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's what the new Data Protection Bill and &quot;right to be forgotten&quot; could mean for you:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Facebook to be forced to delete your information on demand under new law                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you ticked a box that gave a company permission to use your personal information for marketing or targeted advertising, and have come to regret it, the new bill will allow you to withdraw your consent at any time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This should encourage companies to treat your information with respect, and not bombard you with unsolicited communications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you uploaded embarrassing photos to Facebook as a teenager, and now want them wiped from your record, the new bill will give you the power to do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You will also be able to force companies to delete your contact details and personal information from their databases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is important that the general public embraces this new freedom and recognises the value of personal data,&quot; said David Emm, principal security researcher, Kaspersky Lab.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is important that we on an individual level know what information is being kept and how it's being handled - which will also reduce the likelihood of it falling into the wrong hands.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Children are accessing the internet from an early age these days, so it's important their personal data is being protected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new bill will give parents and guardians direct control over where their child's data is used.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Parents must stop kids using social media &quot;like junk food&quot;, says government's top child protection adviser                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If companies want to collect your personal data, they will have to gain your explicit consent - meaning you will have to proactively tick a box saying you agree.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That means default opt-in and pre-selected &quot;tick boxes&quot; will become a thing of the past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is not yet clear whether the same principle will be applied to the government's collection of citizens' personal data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It feels hypocritical for the government to be trumpeting these new data protection measures while at the same time being responsible for the Investigatory Powers Act, or Snoopers' Charter, that runs completely contrary to these proposals,&quot; said Simon Migliano, Head of Research atTop10VPN.com.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Will the Government have to ask 'explicit' permission to harvest your data? Will you be able to ask them to view or delete the data the Government holds on you? I doubt it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Consumers should not rely on the Government to look after their digital rights and data. Instead they should take responsibility for minimising their digital footprint through a combination of cautious, careful habits and technology.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Facebook exec quit job and lives as a RECLUSE claiming machines 'destroy jobs' and will spark an 'ugly' revolution                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the digital, age the definition of personal data is not always clear, and the ways we share information online are constantly evolving.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new bill will expand the definition to cover the digital footprints you leave online without even realising - such as IP addresses and internet cookies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It will also include DNA - which means the biometric information you use to access digital service, such as fingerprints, facial recognition and iris scanning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The expansion of personal identifiable information to include IP addresses, DNA and cookies is going to be no easy task for businesses to identify and protect,&quot; said Bharat Mistry, principal security strategist at Trend Micro.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What's more, they'll need to have both an effective consent policy in place, and know exactly where this data is held should a consumer exercise their right to be forgotten.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And this doesn't just to apply to businesses themselves, but any third party partners that might be processing their customer data, meaning there are a lot of plates to spin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you use a lot of online services, it can be difficult to keep track of what information you have given to each company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bill will allow you to request a full breakdown of the information any given company holds on you.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This does provide some challenges for business in terms of getting their houses in order, but, ultimately, this now means that privacy needs to be at the core of their business strategies,&quot; said Mark Thompson, head of privacy advisory at KPMG.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Instagram named worst social network for cyberbullying with two in five victims going on to develop anxiety                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you have lost trust in one online service provider and want to switch to another, the bill will make it easier to do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It will also make it easier to share information between two difference service providers, so you don't have to enter it all over again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If a company loses your personal information, you can often feel powerless to do anything about it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the terms of the bill, the Information Commissioner's Office will be given the power to issue higher fines of up to &pound;17 million pounds or 4% of global turnover, in cases of very serious data breaches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The measures should encourage companies to take data protection seriously, and help give users of online services peace of mind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All too often consumers suffer the consequences when company failures lead to their data being compromised, so the government must ensure they can easily get redress when data is lost,&quot; said Alex Neill, managing director of home products and services at Which?.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WhatsApp has agreed to not share user data with parent company Facebook before new data protection regulations come into force in May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The messaging service has signed an &quot;undertaking&quot; with data protection watchdog the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), publicly committing to not share personal data with Facebook, which acquired WhatsApp in 2014.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ICO launched an investigation into WhatsApp in 2016 over whether the app could legally share data with Facebook, after concerns were raised that the firm was not being &quot;fully transparent&quot; over its plans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     WhatsApp is making a massive new change - that users are going to LOVE                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ICO said its investigation has found that had the firm shared user data, it would have been illegal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Information commissioner Elizabeth Denham said her investigation concluded that WhatsApp &quot;has not identified a lawful basis of processing for any such sharing of personal data&quot; and &quot;such sharing would involve the processing of personal data for a purpose that is incompatible with the purpose for which such data was obtained&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She added: &quot;If they had shared the data, they would have been in contravention of the first and second data protection principles of the Data Protection Act.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Denham said that WhatsApp had also failed to provide adequate information to users that explained how their data was processed and shared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     How to unsend WhatsApp messages and other tips and tricks: the ultimate guide to the global chat app                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response, the messaging app has signed the undertaking, declaring that it will not share any EU user data until the new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) comes into force in May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The regulations will replace existing data protection laws and are designed to strengthen user control over their personal data and how it is used.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Denham confirmed one type of data sharing between Facebook and WhatsApp - a technical practice known as a &quot;data processor&quot; where sharing is done as a support service to WhatsApp - could continue, as it was not usually a data privacy issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WhatsApp</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is common practice and if done consistently with the law, under contract, does not generally raise data protection concerns,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Data protection law does not prevent a company from sharing personal data - they just have to follow the legal requirements.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I therefore compliment WhatsApp in signing this undertaking, which I believe will build trust amongst their many UK users.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I would also like to stress that signing an undertaking is not the end of the story and I will closely monitor WhatsApp's adherence to it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ICO also confirmed that WhatsApp would not face a fine following the investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement, a WhatsApp spokesman said: &quot;WhatsApp cares deeply about the privacy of our users. We collect very little data and every message is end-to-end encrypted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As we've repeatedly made clear for the last year, we are not sharing data in the ways that the UK information commissioner has said she is concerned about, anywhere in Europe.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UK's data protection watchdog has concluded that WhatsApp's sharing of user data with its parent company Facebook would have been illegal. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The messaging app was forced to pause sharing of personal data with Facebook in November 2016, after the Information Commissioner's Office said it had cause for concern. The ICO opened a full investigation into the matter in August that year.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elizabeth Denham, the information commissioner, said her investigation found that &quot;WhatsApp has not identified a lawful basis of processing for any such sharing of personal data&quot; and that &quot;if they had shared the data, they would have been in contravention of the first and second data protection principles of the Data Protection Act.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response WhatsApp has signed an undertaking declaring that it will not share any EU user data with Facebook until the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) comes into force on 25 May. It also stated that it would only share data in accordance with the requirements of GDPR after 25 May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Denham is also chair of the taskforce set up to investigate data sharing between WhatsApp and Facebook by the Article 29 Working Party pan-European data protection group. Article 29 first issued a warning in October 2016 before launching the taskforce a year later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Various other European countries have also raised concerns over the data sharing, including France which ordered WhatsApp to stop sharing data in December. The EU fined Facebook &pound;94m for providing misleading information over its technical capabilities in terms of sharing user data before its acquisition of WhatsApp in 2014.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UK consumers are being put at risk of fraud because banks are &quot;seriously lagging behind international competitors&quot; when it comes to security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New research has revealed UK financial services organisations are failing to invest and not keeping up with digital investment seen in other sectors.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While other countries are taking a lead in facial recognition, social media data and automated electronic data capture to ID customers and improve the customer experience, British-based banks are stuck in the dark age.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Read more</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Half of UK companies 'have been victims of fraud or economic crime'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A third of British banks and fintechs say they are 'seriously lagging behind international competitors' when it comes to fraud checks, while 84 per cent of UK financial service firms are concerned about their ability to identify customers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The research also revealed that UK firms are less inclined to invest in new technology to address this and are more focused on cost control than their global counterparts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mick Hegarty, managing director at identity data intelligence specialist GBG, said: &quot;As consumers, we're so used to technology being used to speed up the identification process, as a result our expectations have risen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Facial recognition and automated electronic document capture have been used in airports for some time now and the iPhone X has taken facial recognition to an even more mainstream level, so it seems particularly clunky and outdated to have to visit a branch and produce a hard copy of an identity document and/or a utility bill to open up a new account.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The likes of Amazon, Apple and Facebook have really raised the bar and everybody else needs to keep up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the UK's reputation as a world-leader in artificial intelligence, interest in new technology such as facial recognition, automated data capture and social media data analysis has yet to be widely adopted in the UK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the study conducted by Forrester, this is just one symptom of the UK financial sector lagging behind China, Singapore, the US and Australia in its approach to customer identity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Major regulatory changes this year including Open Banking and GDPR, as well as ongoing Brexit negotiations, are impacting the sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time customer expectations continue to rise as a result of digital empowerment and great experiences from the likes of Amazon, Apple and Facebook.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In order to improve customer retention, loyalty, advocacy and customer satisfaction, UK financial service firms need to address the gap between their approach to new technology and that of their global competition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Financial service firms should build relationships through services that exceed customers' current expectations and anticipate their future needs, improving financial wellbeing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hegarty adds: &quot;Although the UK is currently behind the rest of the world in its digital approach to customer identity, there are some promising signs for the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our research shows that UK fintechs are more interested than the established banks in adopting new approaches and more are planning to increase investment in the next 12 months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These new challenger banks will prove vital to the UK financial service sector in keeping pace with the rest of the world whilst we navigate a challenging year of legislation and policy change.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UK consumers are being put at risk of fraud becausebanksare &quot;seriously lagging behind international competitors&quot; when it comes tosecurity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New research has revealed UK financial services organisations are failing to invest and not keeping up with digital investment seen in other sectors.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While other countries are taking a lead in facial recognition, social media data and automated electronic data capture to ID customers and improve the customer experience, British-based banks are stuck in the dark age.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A third of British banks and fintechs say they are 'seriously lagging behind international competitors' when it comes to fraud checks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And 84 per cent of UK financial service firms are concerned about their ability to identify customers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Fraud probe after 15 members of one family claim &pound;1million over Grenfell Tower tragedy                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The research also revealed that UK firms are less inclined to invest in new technology to address this and are more focused on cost-control than their global counterparts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mick Hegarty, Managing Director at identity data intelligence specialist GBG, said: &quot;As consumers, we're so used to technology being used to speed up the identification process, as a result our expectations have risen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Facial recognition and automated electronic document capture have been used in airports for some time now, and theiPhone Xhas taken facial recognition to an even more mainstream level, so it seems particularly clunky and outdated to have to visit a branch and produce a hard copy of an identity document and/or a utility bill to open up a new account.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The likes of Amazon, Apple and Facebook have really raised the bar and everybody else needs to keep up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the UK's reputation as a world-leader in artificial intelligence, interest in new technology such as facial recognition, automated data capture and social media data analysis has yet to be widely adopted in the UK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the study conducted by Forrester, this is just one symptom of the UK financial sector lagging behind China, Singapore, the US and Australia in its approach to customer identity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Major regulatory changes this year including Open Banking and GDPR, as well as ongoingBrexitnegotiations, are impacting the sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time customer expectations continue to rise as a result of digital empowerment and great experiences from the likes of Amazon, Apple, and Facebook.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Couple used phishing scam on Just Eat servers to steal personal details of thousands of customers to be sold on Dark Web                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In order to improve customer retention, loyalty, advocacy and customer satisfaction, UK financial service firms need to address the gap between their approach to new technology and that of their global competition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Financial service firms should build relationships through services that exceed customers' current expectations and anticipate their future needs, improving financial wellbeing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hegarty adds: &quot;Although the UK is currently behind the rest of the world in its digital approach to customer identity, there are some promising signs for the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our research shows that UK fintechs are more interested than the established banks in adopting new approaches and more are planning to increase investment in the next 12 months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These new challenger banks will prove vital to the UK financial service sector in keeping pace with the rest of the world whilst we navigate a challenging year of legislation and policy change.&quot;</SPAN></P>

As well as discussing the Bible, he likes to talk about data security. James's other line of work is running MoJoU, a data consultancy he founded in 2015.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His two vocations are not unrelated. Churches hold sensitive data about parishioners - such as passport details for newlyweds, information on children or lists of volunteers - so making sure it is kept safe is crucial. &quot;We have a calling to look after and love people,&quot; said James, 47. &quot;Their data should be no different.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's not just vicars who need to be vigilant. On May 25, a law will come into force heralding the biggest overhaul in dataprotection measures in decades. It will penalise businesses and other organisations that fail to safeguard the personal information of customers or employees, or to provide them with that data when requested to do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is an EU directive, but its provisions will be maintained after Brexit. The maximum fine for breaching the rules will be (EURO)20m (&pound;17m) or 4% of a company's global turnover, whichever is higher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just 8% of small enterprises are ready for the regulations, according to a recent survey conducted by the Federation of Small Businesses. One in three respondents had not started preparing for the GDPR and a further third said they were in only the &quot;early stages&quot; of planning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most worryingly, 18% said they were unaware of it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Penalties and fines will be administered by a beefed-up Information Commissioner's Office. Elizabeth Denham, the information commissioner, has been at pains to emphasise that May 25 will not usher in an era of punitive action against small businesses. &quot;We have always preferred the carrot to the stick,&quot; Denham said. &quot;We will use fines and serious sanctions only as a last resort. Our first resort is education and support.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That message, though, has not filtered down to entrepreneurs - even those who have spent time and money preparing for the GDPR. &quot;The one thing that terrifies me is the level of fine,&quot; said Emma Heathcote-James, founder of the Little Soap Company in Broadway, Worcestershire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If that fear might be misplaced, the sheer amount of time spent meeting the new obligations can feel onerous to many entrepreneurs, for whom hiring specialist data-protection staff is not an option.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For small businesses, looked at in isolation, it is a compliance headache,&quot; said Jonny McDonald, data-protection specialist at law firm Charles Russell Speechlys. Heathcote-James, who sells luxury soaps and candles and employs four staff, spends half a day a week working on GDPR compliance. &quot;It's time taking your eye off the ball,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not surprisingly, business is booming for James, who has focused his consultancy on the change in the law. &quot;It's gone completely bananas - we've got more work than we know what to do with,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GDPR has even caused his digital and spiritual lives to overlap. His consultancy advises more than 4,000 churches on how to manage data - from his own Anglican ministry to Catholic dioceses, the Salvation Army and the YMCA.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE new General Data Protection Regulation laws will come into force in the UK later this year and will have a massive impact on the way personal data can be used. But what is the GDPR and when does it apply?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GETTY</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GDPR 2018: General Data Protection Regulation applies from May                                            </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GDPR is a regulation from the European Union which is intended to strengthen and unify data protection for all individuals within the Brussels bloc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The document is the sum of four years of work by the EU to bring data protection legislation into line with new and unforeseen ways that data is now being used and stored.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to, BBC Apprentice Winner and Founder of Climb Online, Mark Wright, the GDPR rules are &quot;the largest data protection overhaul in 20 years&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GDPR aims to ensure the following:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That businesses and public-sector organisations have consent to store individual data and that it is treated with respect.That businesses and public-sector organisations are transparent with data and can show consumers exactly what personal information they have on file when requested to do so.That businesses can justify exactly why they have personal data, and what they are using it for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is General Data Protection Regulation?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Currently, the UK relies on the Data Protection Act 1998 which was enacted following the 1995 EU Data Protection Directive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                      Related articles  Irish border Brexit issue solved by eu single market access  'Everyone wants a trade deal with Britain' claims Icelandic minister                                             </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, this will now be superseded by the new GDPR legislation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GDPR introduces tougher fines for non-compliance and&nbsp;breaches&nbsp;and gives people more say over what companies can do with their data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also makes data protection rules more or less identical throughout the EU - and is now enforceable in the UK despite Brexit as it has now been enshrined into British law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The legislation will hopefully&nbsp;give&nbsp;people more control on how their personal data is used in a time when services like Google and Facebook swap access to data for use of their platforms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The document also gives businesses clear instructions under which to operate, with data protection laws now identical across the single market.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mark Wright told Express.co.uk: &quot;If you're on any firm's email marketing lists, these businesses should also be contacting you to ask for consent for continued use of your data, and to review their updated privacy policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even your Employer should be giving you an updated data protection policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After 25th May, it will be illegal for businesses to purchase email marketing or telemarketing lists - which means the levels of cold-calls or cold-emails that you receive should be dramatically reduced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At this point, take the time to review the businesses or organisations that hold your personal data, and only engage with those who you WANT to hear from or who you are happy with holding your information.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The EU estimates this will save businesses a collective (EURO)2.3 billion a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When will the GDPR apply?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GDPR will apply in all EU member states from 25 May 2018.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The legislation actually came into force on 24 May 2016, after&nbsp;all&nbsp;parts of the EU agreed to the final text.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But businesses and organisations have until 25 May 2018 until the law actually applies to them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Wright added: &quot;The new GDPR regulations actually benefits consumers - ensuring firms respect personal data, and do not abuse it in any way, shape or form.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As consumers, you should now only hear from businesses that you have given permission to contact you, where you can request to review exactly what information is held on file for you at any point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ultimately, the new GDPR law will ensure that mishaps such as the Cambridge Analytica scandal do not happen again - protecting individual data for the long-term.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like the snow, data protection issues arrived last week in a flurry. How much can we edit our public past? Who is to judge what a society's collective digitised memory is to retain or recall? A court in London is considering whether UK data protection law enables claimants known as NT1 and NT2 to compel Google to block online searchers from public information about their convictions for conspiracy to account falsely and to intercept communications. Meanwhile, Max Mosley called in aid data protection law to try to stop some newspapers referring to certain events from his past. And the UK parliament is due this week to debate legislation prompted by a new EU General Data Protection Regulation. It updates a directive from 1995 - pre Google, pre Facebook, pre smartphones and apps. Proponents say the GDPR will better balance individual privacy with collection and use of personal information by corporations and governments in the digital era, when, in a sense, we are our data.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2014 the European court of justice ruled in favour of a Spaniard who was discomfited by an archived newspaper item that contained public details about his former indebtedness. The court required Google to prevent the newspaper item being found through its search engine. Google calls this &quot;delisting&quot;. The item was not deleted from the newspaper's electronic archive, but those who searched the man's name would not have the item retrieved and shown among the links in the search results.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meaning changes with context ... new prospects may make it relevant again</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Delisting could occur, said the court, where &quot;information appears, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, to be inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant, or excessive&quot;. &quot;Inaccurate&quot; seemed to be included, too. In NT1-NT2 preliminaries, a judge referred to &quot;inaccurate, stale, irrelevant&quot; information. A French court last year referred to the ECJ the issue of whether the right requires delisting by Google only in the country concerned (current practice), across Europe or worldwide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week Google revealed that since it began in 2014 almost 400,000 requesters have sought the delisting of about 2.4m items (URLs). Google's criteria for delisting were met in 43% of cases.The requests related mainly to France (20.4%), Germany (17.3%) and the UK (12.9%). Main categories of sites that attracted delisting requests were directories, news, social media and government records. Of the top 10 news sites across Europe from which people sought delisting of items between January 2016 and December 2017, half were UK sites: dailymail.co.uk, 1,793 URLs requested for delisting, 27.4% delisting rate; ricerca.gelocal.it, 1,022, 28.6%; telegraph.co.uk, 949, 29.9%; leparisien.fr, 880, 31.9%; ricerca.repubblica.it, 864, 23%; 247.libero.it, 792, 40.5%; mirror.co.uk, 781, 32.8%; ouest-france.fr, 738, 18.1%; bbc.co.uk, 712, 22.4%; thesun.co.uk, 676, 32.8%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guardian staff tell me that since 2014 Google has delisted 159 Guardian items, though four were relisted. Google data says the top five social media sites attracting delisting requests in the January 2016 to December 2017 period were: facebook.com, 15,416 URLs requested for delisting, 52/1% delisting rate; twitter.com, 11,408, 50.1%; plus.google.com, 11,287, 33.2%; instagram.com, 10,388, 90.8%; youtube.com, 8,110, 40.6%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Examples from Google's report on search removals give a sense of the variety of requests, the potential for dishonest applications (a problem in the US too ), the attraction of the process for public figures, and the significant role that data protection agencies can play in delisting decisions:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UK: &quot;A man who was convicted of benefits fraud in 2012 asked us to delist nearly 300 articles related to the conviction based on a document he provided suggesting he was later found innocent of the crime. We delisted 293 URLs pursuant to the documentation the requester provided. The requester then asked us to delist several other pages related to his separate conviction for forging documents. After re-reviewing the original document he submitted as proof of his innocence in the benefits case, we discovered that it was a forgery. We reinstated all of the URLs we had previously delisted.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UK: &quot;A former bank clerk who was imprisoned for stealing money from elderly people's bank accounts asked us to delist news articles from 2008 covering the conviction. His conviction became spent under UK law in 2013. We delisted four articles after the Data Protection Authority requested that we remove.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Germany: &quot;We received a request to delist four news articles about an academic's research that contained the individual's photo because the academic changed gender and identifies under a new name. We did not delist the articles as they continue to be relevant to the academic's professional life and research.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hungary: &quot;A high-ranking public official asked us to remove recent articles discussing a decades-old criminal conviction. We did not remove the articles from search results.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Italy: &quot;A woman requested that we remove a decades-old article about her husband's murder, which included her name. We have removed the page from search results for her name.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Poland: &quot;A prominent business person asked us to remove articles about his lawsuit against a newspaper. We did not remove the articles from search results.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Portugal: &quot;We received an order from the Data Protection Authority to delist a news article about the criminal investigation of a well-known businessman for alleged fraud, falsification of documents and tax evasion. We delisted the page at issue.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spain: &quot;We received a request from an individual to delist a news article from 1994 and a forum post from 2007 about the individual's former activities as the head of a political arm of a state-identified terrorist organisation. We did not delist the article for public interest reasons.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Competing rights, jurisdictions and technologies have to be faced by policy makers. But I fear that, on this &quot;right to be forgotten&quot;, data protection law over-promises. When it under-delivers, it might contribute, in its own small way, to the ebbing of faith in democratic institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Better, I think, to be blunt about the limits of the individual's control over his or her personal information, especially once it is public, and to focus more on accuracy and on transparency over its uses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  'Right to be forgotten' claimant wants to rewrite history, says Google</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, there are exceptional cases when the continuing public availability of accurate information about an identifiable person can cause serious injustice without a sufficient countervailing public interest. True, the notion of wiping the slate of some old or &quot;spent&quot; convictions is not new. Digital realities deserve attention. But care is needed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Information is protean. Its meaning changes with context. Its uses vary with circumstance. Retrospect illuminates facets not previously seen. New prospects may make it relevant again. Inadequate or excessive in itself for one purpose, in combination with other information it may be just right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ECJ's Google Spain &quot;right to be forgotten&quot;, as it is misleadingly described, is fiercely defended and intensively criticised. I believe that it was poorly thought through, and re-examining it will lead to better practical handling of large public datasets of personal information and the engines that sift and sort them. A re-examination is needed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plans to deny millions of people the right to access immigration data held on them by the Home Office are illegal and will be challenged in court, the government has been told.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Organisations representing up to 3 million EU citizens living in the UK and digital rights activists have written to the home secretary, Amber Rudd, giving notice that they will take legal action if a clause in the data protection bill is enacted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  New UK data protection rules are a cynical attack on immigrants | Claude Moraes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The threat is aimed at proposals in the bill to introduce an exemption for immigration information. It is claimed that the clause would prevent those facing deportation from obtaining and challenging the accuracy of personal data held on them by the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two groups - the3million, a grassroots organisation representing EU citizens living in the UK, and the Open Rights Group (ORG), which campaigns on privacy rights and free speech online - argue that the clause in the bill breaches the government's obligations under the EU's general data protection regulation (GDPR).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bill will be debated in parliament on Monday. Rosa Curling, a human rights solicitor from law firm Leigh Day, which is acting on behalf of the3million and ORG, said: &quot;The immigration exemption creates a discriminatory two-tier system for data protection rights. The clause is incompatible with GDPR, as well as EU law generally and the European convention on human rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If the exemption is made law, our clients will apply for judicial review. They have written to the government today to urge it to reconsider and to remove the immigration exemption from the bill without further delay.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jim Killock, the ORG executive director, said: &quot;This is an attempt to disguise the Home Office's mistakes by making sure that their errors are never found. When people are wrongly told to leave, they would find it very hard to challenge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Data protection is a basic safeguard to make sure you can find out what organisations know about you, and why they make decisions. Sometimes, during criminal investigations, that isn't appropriate, but immigrants aren't criminals, nor should they be treated as such.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nicolas Hatton, the chairman of the3million, said: &quot;The UK government has proposed setting up a new registration system for EU citizens after the UK leaves the EU, and this will potentially create a database with the personal details of over 3 million people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We need safeguards in place to ensure that these citizens have access to the information held about them, so they are able to appeal [against] Home Office decisions or correct mistakes. Everyone should be entitled to know how the Home Office and other government agencies are using their records, and that is why we want this exemption removed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Labour MEP Claude Moraes, who chairs the European parliament's civil liberties, justice and home affairs committee, is opposing the bill. &quot;What is happening here is that the UK government, under the cover of the complexity of data protection law in particular, and its chaotic Brexit negotiations in general, is seeking to create damaging new discriminatory national immigration restrictions,&quot; he has said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Immigration caseworkers have said that if clients can no longer access their Home Office files they will never discover why a residency application has been turned down and will be unable to challenge administrative mistakes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A government spokesperson said: &quot;The bill carefully balances protecting people's data rights and the wider interests of society including making sure day-to-day operations relating to immigration controls are not obstructed. There are no blanket exemptions: any restrictions will need to be justified on a case-by-case basis with oversight from the Information Commissioner's Office and the courts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Andrew Walker QC, the chair of the Bar Council of England and Wales, said access requests were often the only way people could find out crucial information about their immigration status, including why adverse decisions had been made about them by the Home Office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Home Office's decision-making record is notoriously poor,&quot; he said. &quot;It is one of the high offices of state and it should be applying the law as parliament intended, but in the 10 years to 2015 it lost a quarter of a million appeals. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our laws should ensure that people can correct mistakes when they are made, rather than insulate the government from legitimate legal challenges.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
</LI><LI CLASS="c10"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"><NOBR>&bull;</NOBR></SPAN></P>
<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tool is designed to comply with new legislation that kicks in later this year&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
</LI><LI CLASS="c10"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"><NOBR>&bull;</NOBR></SPAN></P>
<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is not yet clear how Pornhub's AgeID will work or how ages will be verified&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pornhub recently attracted positive attention when it offered Philadelphia lubricant to grease the city's poles, in order to prevent Philadelphia Eagles fans climbing them during Super Bowl LII, and the pornography website is back in the news after it unveiled AgeID, its online age verification tool.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AgeID was created by Pornhub's parent company Mindgeek, which also owns pornography websites YouPorn and Brazzers and is designed to adhere to the new rules set out in the Digital Economy Act 2017, which requires porn viewers to prove they are over the age of 18.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) has been picked as the regulator and any company that fails to verify the age will be fined &pound;250,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here is all the information on Pornhub's new age verification tool including why and when it is being implemented, and how it works.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     What is Pornhub's AgeID?                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AgeID is designed to force people who watch porn to prove they over the age of 18 in the UK.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is reportedly going to be a one-time verification, meaning that once a person has their age confirmed via AgeID, any subsequent websites using the tool won't require another verification.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the first time, UK users will be prompted to 'Verify my Age' and create a login profile that will work on all AgeID websites.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Verifying age is reportedly going to require either a passport or a mobile number, with the information then being relayed to a 'government-appointed' service to confirm that it is accurate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, such a collection of data has made many people uneasy. Jim Killock, the Executive Director of the privacy group Open Rights Group said: 'The BBFC will struggle to ensure that Age Verification is safe, secure and anonymous. They are powerless to ensure people's privacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'The major publisher, MindGeek, looks like it will dominate the AV market. We are very worried about their product, AgeID, which could track people's porn use,' she added.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, MindGeek spokesman said: 'AgeID has been built from the ground up with data protection, data minimisation and the principles of privacy by design at its core, while also complying with the GDPR.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The spokesman also confirmed that AgeID won't store any personal data entered during the 'age-verification process'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Due to the encrypted nature of AgeID's login credentials, such data cannot be exposed in the unlikely event of a hack,' he added.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MindGeek is also reportedly expected to let third-party websites use its AgeID tool.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     When will Pornhub's AgeID be rolled out?                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MindGeek was originally supposed to roll out the age verification tool in April, so as to conform to the new rules that will kick in that month with the implementation of the Digital Economy Act 2017.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, in a press release about the country's Digital Strategy initiative dated March 10, the UK Government said the following: 'It is anticipated age verification will be enforceable by the end of the year.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reasoning was to give more time for the BBFC to draft guidance and for it to be subsequently cleared by Parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'For the public and the industry to prepare for and comply with age verification, the Government will also ensure a period of up to three months after the BBFC guidance has been cleared by Parliament before the law comes into force.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     What is the Digital Economy Act 2017?                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Digital Economy Act 2017 is wide-ranging legislation that covers everything from how the BBC is regulated to re-transmission fees and a legally-mandated broadband speed minimum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, a large part of the act is dedicated to pornography. The act mandates age-checks in order to prevent under-18s accessing pornographic material.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The act allows an 'age-verification regulator' - the BBFC - to require companies to provide it with 'any information which it requires for the purpose of exercising, or deciding whether to exercise' any of its functions, and to impose financial penalties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The regulator will be allowed to force ISPs to block companies' websites that fail to comply with the legislation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook will soon allow advertisers to target British users based on their religious or political views.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The changes will allow businesses to target - or block - groups of individuals based on the faith or sexuality they identify with in their profile, along posts they have liked and groups they are members of.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The move could raise concerns that radical groups may be able to pay to target certain political groups with recruitment propaganda, perpetuating extremism on the website. A Facebook spokesman said it had policies in place to remove any advertising that appeared to be maliciously profiling certain people.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From today a small number of users will be prompted to check their information and will be advised that it could be used to target them with advertising. Only those who agree will be shown relevant marketing, like Christian-dating apps, for example.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial is part of a wider data privacy clean-up ahead of new data protection laws arriving in May that will particularly affect Facebook, along with companies like Google and marketing businesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The technology giant faces a maximum fine of $1.1bn (&pound;777m) if found in breach of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which will look at how and why companies collect and retain data.&quot;For many years, people had ability to put political religious views and as a part of GDPR we will be asking people if they are happy for that information to be shared,&quot; said Rob Sherman, Facebook's privacy chief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For many years, people had ability to put political religious views and as a part of GDPR we will be asking people if they are happy for that information to be shared,&quot; said Rob Sherman, Facebook's privacy chief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company has previously made presumptions about someone's interested based on posts they like, but under EU regulations was not permitted to use information uploaded to their profile to target them with relevant services or adverts.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company has been able to target its American audience like this thanks to more lenient data protection rules in the US. But it garnered controversy when it emerged that Russians had been able to pay for anti-Democratic propaganda during the run up to the 2016 presidential election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The practice has also been criticised by human rights activities. Undercover reporters at investigative website ProPublica last year revealed that Facebook could easily be gamed to racially discriminate. In one example journalists pretending to be a rental company were able to block certain ethnicities from seeing their adverts. Facebook later apologised.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our existing ad policies prevent people from targeting ads which &nbsp;discriminate against others,&quot; a Facebook spokesperson said.&nbsp; &quot;If we find an ad in violation our policies we will disapprove the ad and send messaging to the advertiser warning them of the violation. If we see&nbsp;egregious, malicious, or repeated violations of our policies, we will typically move to permanently ban the advertiser from running ads.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The social network said it will also bring&nbsp; facial recognition technology to its European users&nbsp;as part of the trial. Around one per cent of its two billion audience will be given the option to start using the photo detection tool, which helps suggests tagging photos and can spot identity theft.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To do this, algorithms analyse the pixels in photos that a person is already tagged in and generate a string of numbers called a template. When photos and videos are uploaded to Facebook's systems, it compares those images to the template. &nbsp;Although impressive, the technology &nbsp;was not used in the EU because of a ban on processing of an individual's sensitive personal data without their explicit permission. By asking for explicit permission, Facebook can lawfully collect this information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Sherman is working to make sure the company, which controls the data of billions of its users, can prove that it has gathered explicit permission from everyone it makes money from their data on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have taken very seriously the privacy concerns we have heard around facial recognition, but we think it is important to use technology that is valuable to people. We want to help enable beneficial uses [of facial recognition technology] while safeguarding against others,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We think that putting people in control this and being clear with people about technology, and people's choices, is&nbsp;an important part of this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last month chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg announced a new privacy control portal that would help people better understand how their information is being used.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ANNUAL profits at Hiscox have plunged 91pc after the insurer had to pay out millions of pounds worth of claims following a record year of natural disasters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The FTSE 250 insurer said the earthquakes, hurricanes and wildfires in the US, Caribbean and Mexico last year left it with a $225m (&pound;160m) bill for claims and &quot;battered insurers' balance sheets&quot; around the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While its pre-tax profits nosedived from &pound;354.5m in 2016 to &pound;30.8m for the year to December, the specialist insurer said prices had finally risen on &quot;catastrophe-exposed lines&quot; such as property and casualty as a result of the losses.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The $140bn of catastrophe losses across the sector led to capital destruction and reserve deficits, and as a result the market is turning,&quot; said chairman Robert Childs. &quot;This is not an immediate process; it comes about through each difficult conversation, each new quotation and each renewal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, chief executive Bronek Masojada said he had hoped prices would have risen more on big ticket policies following years of reductions, months after his counterpart at rival Beazley said the industry was preparing to up rates for the areas hit by the disasters. Further claims from catastrophes this year would mean that prices would likely rise even more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shares in Hiscox, which is one of just three Lloyd's of London insurers left listed in London, fell 2.1pc to &pound;13.67 as investors digested news of the profit fall. Mr Masojada brushed off the drop, however.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When people say, 'oh gosh you had lots of claims', we say, 'yep, that's why people buy them [our policies]',&quot; he said. &quot;When you make an insurance claim, you're expecting a cheque back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hiscox's London market business was most hit by the natural disasters, swinging from a profit of &pound;44m in 2016 to a loss of &pound;36.2m last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It said the division would return to growth due to the increase in rates but &quot;not as much as originally expected&quot; given the rate rises were not as strong as initially hoped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, its US business stood as &quot;the standout performer&quot; of the year having &quot;withstood the impact of the hurricanes well&quot;, the business said. Profit in its retail division - which covers homes, businesses, fine art and wealthy clients - dipped on last year but still exceeded &pound;100m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Looking ahead, Hiscox claimed that there was plenty of opportunity for growth and it would focus on building non-catastrophe lines such as cyber security, having hired former GCHQ chief Robert Hannigan late last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The insurance industry is under pressure to do more to help combat climate change as scientists warn that extreme weather could become the norm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year was one of the worst ever for natural disasters, leaving insurers facing millions of pounds in claims and costing the industry as a whole more than &pound;100bn. The storms were unusual for their extreme power, with US hurricane scientist Eric Blake tweeting that Hurricane Irma will go down as one of the most infamous in Atlantic hurricane history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Natural disasters have not been the only area weighing on insurers in recent months, however.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's hard not to feel tormented by regulation,&quot; Mr Childs added. &quot;We are working hard to navigate geopolitical issues such as Brexit, US tax reform, GDPR and New York's cyber security regulation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm sure I am not alone in appealing for some reprieve from the regulatory leapfrog while we deal with so many sizeable global issues.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The data watchdog has warned Tusla, the child and family agency, about its poor record-keeping after a false sex abuse allegation about Sergeant Maurice McCabe, the whistleblower. The Data Protection Commission (DPC) said the organisation did not properly plan for the processing of personal and sensitive data when it was set up almost four years ago.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It began an inquiry into Tusla's personal data controls after it emerged in February last year that an unfounded rape allegation had been put on a file relating to Sergeant McCabe and circulated to garda&iacute; three years earlier. Tusla apologised and the scandal was examined at the Disclosures Tribunal. The DPC did not specifically refer to the McCabe affair in its annual report. It said its inquiry started in March last year into the governance of personal data concerning child protection cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It said: &quot;The processing of personal and sensitive data, in the context of file management and record keeping overall, was not sufficiently planned for in the form of a robust data governance strategy when Tusla was established in 2014, bringing together a considerable volume of casework and over 4,000 staff from three distinct agencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is critical that the casework management system deployed across all areas of Tusla generates a full and complete record of all casework material concerning each case to mitigate the risk that the system might give an inaccurate, incomplete or distorted view of each case. Evidence was identified in multiple and overlapping volumes of individual case files where no complete 'master file' could be identified, and with no audit trail in relation to the handling of the file.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The DPC carried out unannounced inspections in Tusla offices in Limerick, Tralee, Kilkenny, Drogheda, Navan, Churchtown, Portlaoise, and the Dublin headquarters. Tusla was issued with 59 findings by the commission in January and given two months to set out a plan of action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In its annual report, the commission said that it received a record number of complaints - 2,642 - last year, compared with 1,479 in 2016. It dealt with a record 2,973 data breach notifications and 2,795 were classed as valid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The watchdog said it expected to issue its first findings on its inquiries into the public services card before June. Helen Dixon, the data protection commissioner, said: &quot;Cybersecurity must be a priority for all organisations to maintain integrity and confidentiality, particularly as this is one of the two new general principles of data protection introduced under the GDPR, Europe's general data protection regulation, and against which the higher level of fines will apply.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The DPC investigated 21 complaints on the &quot;right to be forgotten&quot;. Six were upheld, 12 rejected and another three are still being examined.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crossing over to the nonexecutive side of the boardroom table may seem like a natural progression for senior executives approaching the end of their careers, but for most it's a move that will require plenty of preplanning and preparation. Anyone considering working as a non-executive director should educate themselves - formally and informally - around corporate governance. &quot;It's very onerous being a nonexecutive director, so you need to know exactly what you're taking on and you need to be fully knowledgeable of the legal requirements,&quot; said Thora Mackey, chief operating officer at the Institute of Directors in Ireland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A good starting point is to get an understanding of the Companies Act 2014 and its implications for directors. For certain sectors - such as charities and financial services - it will be necessary to be aware of the specific regulatory environments.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having a background in the particular sector will not necessarily suffice. &quot;You may be an executive in the financial services industry but not be looking at the board piece,&quot; said Mackey. &quot;You do need to do that to familiarise yourself with the specifics around what board members need to know.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And, particularly topical is the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which will replace the existing data protection laws in the EU when it comes into effect on May 25. &quot;Ultimately, the responsibility rests with the board for ensuring it's implemented and monitored,&quot; Mackey said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An increasing number of directors and prospective directors - both executive and non-executive - are undertaking some kind of formal training, such as the Institute of Directors' chartered director programme, UCD's diploma in corporate governance, or the Irish Management Institute's diploma in governance and compliance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A broad range of business knowledge outside an individual's particular speciality helps. Prospective board members should also look at developing soft skills such as good communications skills, critical thinking and the ability to challenge constructively. &quot;Boards really need someone who's independent,&quot; said one seasoned director. &quot;It can often be human nature to try to fit in. Your function is not to agree with the management all the time. You've got to challenge.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some people have an advantage when it comes to catching the interest of prospective boards. &quot;In the listed company sector, having been a senior manager in a big company is attractive,&quot; said Professor Niamh Brennan, academic director of the UCD Centre for Corporate Governance. &quot;Having been a chief executive or chief financial officer definitely helps to land non-executive directorships.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Tony McPoland, who has a portfolio of 12 directorships, particular experience - such as finance, marketing and IT - can also be an advantage. &quot;And I think anyone who has a background in compliance and regulatory affairs around GDPR would be snapped up at the moment,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McPoland said his appointments have taken between three and 22 months to secure from having first conversations to receiving formal confirmation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After being made redundant from his senior executive position in regulatory financial services, McPoland decided he wanted to have a series of part-time roles and consciously built up his portfolio of directorships. He started out with two non-executive roles on special purpose vehicles from his previous employer and did the Institute of Directors chartered director programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I then spent the next two years drinking a lot of coffee and buying a lot of lunches telling people what I was doing,&quot; he said. &quot;All my early roles came from my personal network.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His advice for anyone planning a nonexecutive career is to be prepared to get out and explain what you're doing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People are not going to ring you out of the blue,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another director noted that the informal approach is still quite prevalent among board appointments in private companies in Ireland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That probably smacks of the old boys' club,&quot; he said. &quot;It is and it isn't. If I had a choice of three candidates and knew one of them and thought they might do the job well, it might short-circuit an interview process.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He stressed the importance of starting to develop networks early. &quot;If you're starting to network at the end of your executive career, you're probably about 20 years too late,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a view that starting out on a charity board is a good way of gaining experience. Brennan urges caution. &quot;In that sector, money is always a problem so the risk of insolvency is greater,&quot; she said. &quot;You do not want to be a director of an insolvent organisation. I would advise people to do their due diligence very, very carefully.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mackey, meanwhile, said charities are very complex and the boards have to function very well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vacancies also come up quite regularly on state boards, but again Brennan urges caution. &quot;Some of them are established by statute in a very dysfunctional manner,&quot; she said. &quot;A state board is an opportunity to get governance experience, but be careful that you know what you're getting into.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All state board positions are advertised on www.Stateboards.ie. On the not-for-profit side, Boardmatch Ireland (www.boardmatchireland.ie) provides a free matching service for boards and prospective candidates. And members of the Institute of Directors in Ireland can register with the Boardroom Centre to potentially be matched to client companies. Typical pay for a non-executive in the funds industry is about (EURO)15,000 to (EURO)20,000 to prepare for, attend and do any necessary follow-up for four to six meetings per year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among listed companies, the rewards are significantly higher. In Glanbia, for example, non-executive directors earned (EURO)70,000 in 2017. In 2015, AIB paid its non-executive directors a minimum of (EURO)80,000 each.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">www.Stateboards.ie lists vacancies for two new members of the Central Bank Commission who will earn just under (EURO)15,000 each. Two slots on the Nama board are also advertised; each pays (EURO)50,000 per year. Not-for-profit roles are generally unpaid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most non-executive directors don't do it for financial gain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's important that there's absolute synergy between the two of you and that your value systems are aligned,&quot; said Mackey. &quot;It's very enjoyable and challenging and can be extremely rewarding to be on a board, but you need to go into it with your eyes wide open.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Your function is not to agree with the management all the time. You've got to challenge</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Iam due to give a talk shortly to a public body. As a courtesy, the organisers of the event emailed me a list of their members who have registered to attend. The excel document was passwordprotected due to new GDPR regulations. GDPR stands for General Data Protection Regulation and it refers to a 2016 EU regulation to harmonise data protection laws across the member states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The regulation introduces several obligations for organisations that handle personal data, such as stricter mechanisms for obtaining consents, timely notification of breaches and keeping the need for data to a minimum in the first place. Individuals also have several rights such as access to and rectification of their personal information and the right to have it erased.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another consequence is that Ireland must set a digital age of consent. The original text of the GDPR tabled by the European Commission in 2012 proposed a threshold of 13 years. During final negotiations with the European Parliament this was increased to 16 but with an option for individual member states to reduce it to as low as 13 - the route the Irish government is proposing to take.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Contrary to what the term might suggest, it doesn't refer to the age at which children can decide for themselves to access the internet or engage in online activities. Instead, it refers to the age from which it is legal for data controllers to gather and hold data from minors without parental consent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charlie Flanagan, the justice minister, has explained the government's preference for 13 by saying that organisations involved in child welfare have recommended it. A government advisory group has also recommended 13.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other experts hold a contrary viewpoint. Two leading cyber security figures recently told the Oireachtas committee on children and youth affairs that there are significant risks in opting for 13. Professor Barry O'Sullivan, director of the Insight Centre for Data Analytics at UCC, said that it would allow social media companies to gather information about a child, including where they live, where they go to school, or their family photographs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Mary Aiken, adjunct associate professor at UCD's Geary Institute for Public Policy, believes the internet is &quot;not fit for children as it stands&quot;. She has said that Irish children under 16 are deemed too young to attend a GP on their own for health advice, so the same age should apply for digital consent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several aspects of the government's stance on the issue are worrying. Rather than explain and defend its own position, it seems to be hiding behind various organisations. That's a wholly inadequate position. Any minister can readily find advice that he or she likes and then act on it. It's an old and well-established political game, but it doesn't in any way dilute the government's responsibility for deciding its own policy in this area. That should follow a consideration of the pros and cons of different stances rather than just outsourcing policy-making to unaccountable experts. There was public consultation on the age of consent, but it was more likely to have been responded to by corporate interests with a lot at stake rather than parents too busy with today's real concerns to spend a lot of time on possible concerns that may arise tomorrow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The outcome certainly seems to reflect the interests of the former ahead of the latter, many of whom would be shocked to learn that the government wants to give 13-yearold children the right to decide which organisations may hold their personal data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The woolly thinking permeating the official stance on the question was illustrated at Oireachtas hearings on Wednesday when Ronan Lupton, a barrister and member of the government's internet advisory group, was asked why he believes the digital age of consent should be lowered to 13. He said that if a parent puts a picture of a naked child on the internet, the child would not have the right to have that picture taken down without the intervention of the parent until they reached 16. I find that scenario unlikely, if occasionally possible. Martin Conway, a Fine Gael senator, asked him about the reverse scenario, where a young person put a provocative picture of themselves on the internet. Would it be the case that a parent could not require it to be taken down if the child were over 13? &quot;I think that would be the case, yes,&quot; Lupton replied, only to be told by Conway that the vast majority of parents would be horrified by such a prospect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same hearings, four ministers turned out to bat for the government position. Katherine Zappone, the children's minister, said that the presence of technology giants in Ireland should be used to push for safeguards. &quot;We must link responsibility for child welfare and protection with the provision of services,&quot; she said. &quot;We must embed responsibility for child welfare and protection in all services to children.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That sounds wonderful, but it presumes the technology giants are public-spirited bodies that will drop everything to listen rather than profit-orientated corporations focused on maximising their commercial opportunities and minimising their costs. I don't criticise their stance. What I do criticise is our government relying on trust and good faith endeavours to prevail over it. Flanagan said that legislation could be introduced to make it illegal for social media companies to use data from children under 16. If so, why not set the digital age of consent at 16 in the first place and save everyone additional bother? Looking at the way the issue has been handled so far there is a grave danger that the government has followed the groupthink of corporate interests and experts rather than the example of Germany and the Netherlands which have opted for 16.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One expert believes the internet is not fit for children as it stands</SPAN></P>

Here's why you should be worried</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Permanent records in the real world contain information that has some sort of administrative, historical, or legal worth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's a reason they need to be preserved such as your medical history, a criminal record, a birth certificate, or perhaps a will.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But what about permanent records online? Information doesn't fade away like it used to. What was once lost in files, is now there ready and searchable, for who knows how long.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is it something to be worried about, even to fear? What even is a permanent record?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here are five things you should know - and fear:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It equally gathers important and meaningless information about you and keeps it forever. Your birth certificate gets filed with your tweets. It's just a big melting pot of everything you do online. That means pictures, web browser histories, sites you join, emails, attachments, posts and so on, forming a profile of yourself that may be nothing like who you really are.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Every time you go online, you're adding another entry to this in-erasable entity. There is no privacy with an online permanent record. Permanent in most instances, just means public.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sometimes you hear a permanent record referred to as a 'digital footprint.' But that's not quite accurate. Some footprints can be covered or removed. But a permanent record can't be deleted from the Internet. When you pull down a Twitter post or empty your inbox, that information doesn't just disappear. Once information goes public, it gets collected and retained by apps, people, companies, data collectors and the government. Even if you close an account like Instagram or Snapchat, traces of your history remain. The only difference being you can't get into the app anymore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Google</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With Facebook, it doesn't even matter if you belong to Facebook. The company can track you on any site that connects to Facebook with a &quot;like&quot; box. The company can also track non-member friends of Facebook users.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     13 ways your online privacy was violated in 2016 - and what you can do about it                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Permanent records online in most cases have no historical or legal value, not to us anyway. They are a goldmine however to the companies collecting and maintaining them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's what that could mean to you:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Mark Weinstein: Did Facebook elect Trump President? The role it played with 'fake news'                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This win by European users against Google has the potential to let users regain some control of their permanent record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People should have the right to clean their records. They should be able to maintain their truth online. The problem however is you still must go through a process, leap through some hoops, to get that information removed from Google's search engine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's better than nothing though, which is how life is in the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We need online privacy to protect ourselves, our families, and our friends. With a permanent record, we also need online privacy to protect our reputation and ability to earn a living. Our digital self should mirror that of ourselves. That requires better control of our private information. We should have means to ensure its accuracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Laws such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) are a step in the right direction. But be careful regardless about what you do and post online. It's no longer a question of if someone is watching, but rather the numbers of entities doing it.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most businesses are reliant on a complex supply chain to maintain efficiency. From outsourced payroll or marketing services to medical insurance providers, the supply chain is often larger than first anticipated. It should come as no surprise that this will be highly scrutinised under the EU's new General Data Protection Regulation, which will come into effect in May, due to the sheer volume of data processed as part of it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In preparation, companies need to know exactly what their supply chain looks like by undertaking a risk-based audit, with efforts focused where it matters most from a privacy perspective. This is something that is much easier said than done. However, there are some simple steps that businesses can take in order to comply.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First and foremost, it is important to map precisely where data you are responsible for lies throughout the supply chain. Once this is established, you will need to control what your new, existing and previous suppliers are doing with the personal data shared with them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New suppliers should be brought on board with a contract outlining precisely what data will be shared, what it can be used for and what will happen to it at the termination of the contract. It will also be crucial to define a meaningful retention period for holding on to the data following the end of the contract and how the data will be destroyed and/or returned at the end of this period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Existing supplier contracts need updating to reflect these precautions, while carrying out a full review of their current distributed data will ensure they only have access to the information they need.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Previous suppliers can be trickier to handle and will most likely need to be reviewed to identify areas of high risk that need to be addressed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carrying out these measures will protect customers from unlawful uses of their personal information. For example, a marketing company co-ordinating email campaigns would only have access to information relevant for that purpose - that means no date of birth or bank details - and would not lawfully be able to add customers to other distribution lists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Any actual or suspected data breaches, whether large or small, must be recorded or tracked in a breach log.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a minimum, reporting on exactly when a breach took place, how it happened, the decision that was made in response, and who signed off this decision will prove a business is at least attempting to comply. Since the general consensus of GDPR is &quot;the more, the better&quot;, those wishing to demonstrate intent beyond mere compliance should link the recorded breach to any steps taken to prevent further breaches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To ensure full transparency over any potential breaches to data you are responsible for, it's highly advised that contracts developed with suppliers should agree access to their own breach logs. This also provides an opportunity to monitor for vulnerabilities and flag when a supplier's cyber security might not be up to scratch - any alarming activity will provide a warning sign to change suppliers and can help avoid falling victim to a severe cyber attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When collecting data, businesses will be required to disclose what it is being used for, as well as how it will be processed, shared and stored. Due to the extent of most supply chains, it's also highly likely that somewhere along the line, data may be shared or stored outside the EU.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even if a supplier is not UK-based, they will need to comply with the same regulations if they hold any personal data relating to people in the EU. But the onus is on the business responsible for the data to ensure that any contracted suppliers meet these standards, especially as the fines handed out by the Information Commissioner's Office are likely to skyrocket under GDPR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More significant contraventions of the regulation could result in fines of up to (EURO)20m (&pound;17.7m) or 4pc of an organisation's global turnover, whichever is the greater figure. One example of the increased financial risk to companies is the TalkTalk breach that allowed cyber attackers to access customer data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company was fined &pound;400,000 in 2016, but under GDPR this would rise significantly to around (EURO)59m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is also crucial to raise awareness with key stakeholders. Not just so that everyone is aware of the changes required and the amount of work to be planned for and carried out, but also so they understand that responsibility for preparing for GDPR does not sit solely with the IT department and the legal team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this way, every department within the business must work in tandem to &quot;know their data&quot;, the extent of the supply chain and, crucially, secure board buy-in for this shift.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the months are drawing ever closer to GDPR's implementation, businesses need to ensure they are making significant steps towards securing the supply chain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The main objectives for any business should be to improve their security defences, ensure all sensitive data is safeguarded, and to use GDPR as an opportunity to review their entire security strategy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Understanding that attacks will happen and ensuring appropriate reactions is crucial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the initial task can be overwhelming, approaching GDPR with a structured, risk-based approach is the best way forward.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most businesses are reliant on a complex supply chain to maintain efficiency. From outsourced payroll or marketing services to medical insurance providers, the supply chain is often larger than first anticipated. It should come as no surprise that this will be highly scrutinised under the EU's new General Data Protection Regulation, which will come into effect in May, due to the sheer volume of data processed as part of it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In preparation, companies need to know exactly what their supply chain looks like by undertaking a risk-based audit, with efforts focused where it matters most from a privacy perspective. This is something that is much easier said than done. However, there are some simple steps that businesses can take in order to comply.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First and foremost, it is important to map precisely where data you are responsible for lies throughout the supply chain. Once this is established, you will need to control what your new, existing and previous suppliers are doing with the personal data shared with them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New suppliers should be brought on board with a contract outlining precisely what data will be shared, what it can be used for and what will happen to it at the termination of the contract. It will also be crucial to define a meaningful retention period for holding on to the data following the end of the contract and how the data will be destroyed and/or returned at the end of this period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Existing supplier contracts need updating to reflect these precautions, while carrying out a full review of their current distributed data will ensure they only have access to the information they need.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Previous suppliers can be trickier to handle and will most likely need to be reviewed to identify areas of high risk that need to be addressed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carrying out these measures will protect customers from unlawful uses of their personal information. For example, a marketing company co-ordinating email campaigns would only have access to information relevant for that purpose - that means no date of birth or bank details - and would not lawfully be able to add customers to other distribution lists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Any actual or suspected data breaches, whether large or small, must be recorded or tracked in a breach log.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a minimum, reporting on exactly when a breach took place, how it happened, the decision that was made in response, and who signed off this decision will prove a business is at least attempting to comply. Since  the general consensus of GDPR  is &quot;the more, the better&quot;, those wishing to demonstrate intent beyond mere compliance should link the recorded breach to any steps taken to prevent further breaches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To ensure full transparency over any potential breaches to data you are responsible for, it's highly advised that contracts developed with suppliers should agree access to their own breach logs. This also provides an opportunity to monitor for vulnerabilities and flag when a supplier's cyber security might not be up to scratch - any alarming activity will provide a warning sign to change suppliers and can help avoid falling victim to a severe cyber attack.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When collecting data, businesses will be required to disclose what it is being used for, as well as how it will be processed, shared and stored. Due to the extent of most supply chains, it's also highly likely that somewhere along the line, data may be shared or stored outside the EU.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even if a supplier is not UK-based, they will need to comply with the same regulations if they hold any personal data relating to people in the EU. But the onus is on the business responsible for the data to ensure that any contracted suppliers meet these standards, especially as the fines handed out by the Information Commissioner's Office are likely to skyrocket under GDPR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More significant contraventions of the regulation could result in fines of up to (EURO)20m (&pound;17.7m) or 4pc of an organisation's global turnover, whichever is the greater figure. One example of the increased financial risk to companies is the&nbsp;TalkTalk breach that allowed cyber attackers to access customer data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company was fined &pound;400,000 in 2016, but under GDPR this would rise significantly to around (EURO)59m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">High-profile hacks</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is also crucial to raise awareness with key stakeholders. Not just so that everyone is aware of the changes required and the amount of work to be planned for and carried out, but also so they understand that responsibility for preparing for GDPR does not sit solely with the IT department and the legal team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this way, every department within the business must work in tandem to &quot;know their data&quot;, the extent of the supply chain and, crucially, secure board buy-in for this&nbsp;shift.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the months are drawing ever closer to GDPR's implementation, businesses need to ensure they are making significant steps towards securing the supply chain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The main objectives for any business should be to improve their security defences, ensure all sensitive data is safeguarded, and to use GDPR as an opportunity to review their entire security strategy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Understanding that attacks will happen and ensuring appropriate reactions is crucial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the initial task can be overwhelming, approaching GDPR with a structured, risk-based approach is the best way forward.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of us suspect that our employers are closely watching our day-to-day activities to ensure we're not&nbsp;browsing social media websites or making personal phone calls rather than working.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it's rare for a company to publicly call on its staff members to&nbsp;spy on their colleagues and report lax behaviour&nbsp;- unless of course you are the&nbsp;Australian Taxation Office, which sent out an internal memo in December&nbsp;encouraging employees to snitch on time wasters in the office.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The note, which was released under a freedom of information request, was titled &quot;Seen something suspicious?&quot; and urged staff to report when a colleague &quot;makes a habit of taking long lunches&quot;, &quot;regularly leaves early&quot; or &quot;spends the first hour at work eating breakfast and reading the paper&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There could be explanations - perhaps they travel to work with their partner who has to start early, and they don't 'sign on' until after breakfast. Or maybe they have an agreed working arrangement that enables them to leave early, or partly work from home,&quot;&nbsp;the note said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Or perhaps your suspicions are correct and they're simply not recording their working hours appropriately.&quot;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government agency's&nbsp;20,000&nbsp;public servants were advised to make an anonymous report if they suspected colleagues of&nbsp;failing to accurately record working hours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The note said: &quot;We all have an obligation to assist in reporting fraud by referring any suspicion to either a manager or to fraud prevention and internal investigations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A failure to accurately record working hours &quot;can be fraud&quot;, the note said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   Is it legal for employers to spy on their&nbsp;staff?                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is common for employers to monitor their staff via&nbsp;phone and IT systems, CCTV and even, in more extreme cases, location tracking through employee&nbsp;access passes. It is also completely legal in the UK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And while this&nbsp;Big Brother-style surveillance is often slammed as harmful for workplace culture, as it is an intrusion of&nbsp;privacy, the motivation behind it isn't always negative. Employers say monitoring is often a&nbsp;health and safety measure,&nbsp;to prevent crime, such as theft or misconduct, or misappropriation of intellectual property, and to&nbsp;comply with legal and regulatory obligations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While monitoring is legal, there are several&nbsp;guidelines companies must adhere to, such as&nbsp;providing&nbsp;an unrecorded telephone line for employees to use in emergencies if all other telephones are routinely monitored, and explaining how the information will be stored and processed in accordance with the Data Protection Act, and who has access to this information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 1998 Human Rights Act also plays an important role here&nbsp;as it gives individuals' a right to privacy, therefore&nbsp;employers need to find a balance between an employee's legitimate expectation of privacy and the employers interests when they monitor their staff, says&nbsp;Nicola Goodridge,&nbsp;an&nbsp;employment law and HR consultant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Suzanne Horne of&nbsp;law firm Paul Hastings, says that when it&nbsp;comes to monitoring the amount of time spent on lunch, employers have active obligations under the Working Time Regulations and Health and Safety at Work Act to ensure that employees do take a break.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Monitoring can be justified if it means employees return from their breaks to ensure that their colleagues are also allowed to take their allotted time out. The legal issues arise in terms of how employers conduct this monitoring&nbsp;as, again, this can be in direct conflict with the Data Protection Act and the employees' Article 8 right to a private life under the European Convention of Human Rights,&quot; she says.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   Can an employer&nbsp;read your emails?                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a &nbsp;European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) ruling in 2016, bosses have the right to spy on staff's work emails and electronic messages .&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decision was taken after a&nbsp;Romanian engineer was fired for sending messages to his fiance&eacute; on his private Yahoo chats, and challenged his employer&nbsp;in the High Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The&nbsp;ECHR&nbsp;later defined the&nbsp;scope of corporate snooping by ruling that companies must tell employees in advance, either in the staff handbook or employment contract,&nbsp;if their work email accounts are being monitored.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;An employer does have the right to monitor emails, but it must carry out an impact assessment to demonstrate that it is a balancing act between protecting its employees' privacy, and the legitimate interests of the business,&quot; Ms Horne says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Mark Batey, a senior lecturer in organisational psychology at Alliance Manchester Business School, says that just because employees&nbsp;can monitor their staff, doesn't mean they should.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If monitoring is a way to protect staff, then that's&nbsp;fine, but if it's because you don't trust them then this can be hugely demotivating for&nbsp;employees and your company will be less appealing to prospective staff,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So what could appear to be savings on the surface by making staff more productive&nbsp;could actually prove more costly if you struggle to retain and attract employees.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   Ranked: the top 10 UK companies to work for in 2018                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hannah Reed of Trades Union Congress (TUC) agrees:&nbsp;&quot;British workers put in billions of unpaid overtime every year. They shouldn't be punished for occasionally checking private emails and going on social media.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She says: &quot;Bosses who snoop on their staff undermine trust and damage morale. It is essential that employers have clear policies on Internet use so that people know where they stand. Acting in a draconian way is not the answer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the end of May,&nbsp;the&nbsp;Data Protection Act (DPA) will be replaced by the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a framework with greater scope and much tougher punishments for those who fail to comply with new rules around the storage and handling of personal data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The regulation will favour employees, Ms Horne says, &quot;so businesses must ensure they update privacy notices and policies to reflect these changes and ensure that they continue to have the right to monitor their employees in appropriate circumstances&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE British tech industry has issued a stark warning to leading Brexiteer ministers that diverging from EU data protection standards after Brexit will &quot;undermine&quot; the UK's status as Europe's leading tech hub.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an open letter to Liam Fox, the International Trade Secretary, Julian David, the chief executive of the industry's leading lobby group, said that remaining closely aligned with the EU would not stop the UK seeking trade deals after Brexit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Diverging from EU data protection rules in domestic law post-Brexit would undermine this opportunity,&quot; wrote Mr David, of TechUK, which represents nearly 1,000 UK tech firms, including several FTSE 100 companies.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The letter warned of a growing &quot;misunderstanding&quot; among Brexiteers that Britain could chase a Brexit dividend by diverging from the EU's tough data protection rules in order to seek comparative advantage with Europe in a fast-growing sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We would caution against the misunderstanding that adherence to the EU data protection regime is incompatible with securing high-quality trade agreements,&quot; added Mr David in the letter co-signed by Dean Garfield, the chief executive of the ITI, TechUK's international affiliate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plea from the tech sector's chief lobby group to remain converged with the EU echoes those already made by the pharmaceutical and chemical industries. Thanks to a strong regulatory environment, a central timezone and its geographical location between the US and continental Europe, the UK handles 11.5pc of worldwide data flows - nearly four times its share of global GDP (3.2pc).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UK is also Europe's leader in digital start-ups, with 43pc of all large EU digital companies being started in the UK. It also boasts a burgeoning &pound;7bn &quot;fintech&quot; industry, which employs 60,000 people as part of a financial services industry worth a total of &pound;124bn a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TechUK's decision to publish an open letter represents a shot across the bows to Mr Fox and other Brexiteer ministers who have been lobbying across Whitehall for a more divergent approach to Brexit - often citing the tech industry as an area with exciting possibilities for divergence. TechUK praised the work of the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, which is implementing the EU's new general data protection regulation (GDPR), which will be fully taken into UK law ahead of Brexit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TechUK said its members had made very clear that they had no wish to diverge from the GDPR post-Brexit, having already invested significantly in order to achieve compliance with the new EU regulations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More importantly, Mr David told The Daily Telegraph, remaining compliant will be essential to both retaining and expanding the UK's position as a global tech and data hub.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is the base of international trade deals, if we end up different, then that's a problem,&quot; he said, citing the work that the US had done to reach its own &quot;Privacy Shield&quot; agree ment with the EU in order to keep transatlantic data flows moving. His message contradicts that of leading Brexiteer ministers who have argued internally that the UK needs to be able to have divergent regulations in future economic growth areas such as artificial intelligence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The&nbsp;British tech industry has issued a stark warning to leading Brexiteer ministers that diverging from EU data protection standards after Brexit will &quot;undermine&quot; the UK's status as Europe's leading tech hub.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an open letter to Liam Fox, the International Trade Secretary, Julian David, the chief executive of the industry's leading lobby group, said that remaining closely aligned with the EU would not stop the UK seeking trade deals after Brexit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Diverging from EU data protection rules in domestic law post-Brexit would undermine this opportunity,&quot; wrote Mr David, of TechUK, which represents nearly 1,000 UK tech firms, including several FTSE 100 companies.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The letter warned of a growing &quot;misunderstanding&quot; among Brexiteers that Britain could chase a Brexit dividend by diverging from the EU's tough data protection rules in order to seek comparative advantage with Europe in a fast-growing sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We would caution against the misunderstanding that adherence to the EU data protection regime is incompatible with securing high-quality trade agreements,&quot; added Mr David in the letter co-signed by Dean Garfield, the chief executive of the ITI, TechUK's international affiliate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plea from the tech sector's chief lobby group to remain converged with the EU echoes those already made by the pharmaceutical  and chemical industries. Thanks to a strong regulatory environment, a central timezone and its geographical location between the US and continental Europe, the UK handles 11.5pc of worldwide data flows - nearly four times its share of global GDP (3.2pc).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   How long until Britain leaves the EU?                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UK is also Europe's leader in digital start-ups, with 43pc of all large EU digital companies being started in the UK. It also boasts a burgeoning &pound;7bn &quot;fintech&quot; industry, which employs 60,000 people as part of a financial services industry worth a total of &pound;124bn a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TechUK's decision to publish an open letter represents a shot across the bows to Mr Fox and other Brexiteer ministers who have been lobbying across Whitehall for a more divergent approach to Brexit - often citing the tech industry as an area with exciting possibilities for divergence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TechUK praised the work of the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, which is implementing the EU's new general data protection regulation (GDPR), which will be fully taken into UK law ahead of Brexit. &nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TechUK said its members had made very clear that they had no wish to diverge from the GDPR post-Brexit, having already invested significantly in order to achieve compliance with the new EU regulations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More importantly, Mr David told The Daily Telegraph, remaining compliant will be essential to both retaining and expanding the UK's position as a global tech and data hub.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is the base of international trade deals, if we end up different, then that's a problem,&quot; he said, citing the work that the US had done to reach its own &quot;Privacy Shield&quot; agreement with the EU in order to keep transatlantic data flows moving. His message contradicts that of leading Brexiteer ministers who have argued internally that the UK needs to be able to have divergent regulations in future economic growth areas such as artificial intelligence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They argue such an approach would enable the UK to outflank the EU which has historically taken a highly conservative approach to digital and data issues, thanks to activist-voices in the European Parliament combining with French protectionism and innate German cautiousness on data issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However TechUK believes that when it comes to tech, the Brexiteer divergence narrative is misguided, arguing that in practice the UK is unlikely to want to diverge radically from the EU, particularly when public approaches to data, robotics, artificial intelligence and social media are trending in a more conservative direction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead the UK should use its position as an industry-leader and global data hub to exert 'soft power' influence on shaping EU approach to data regulation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Making the UK the 'wild west' of the data world - or even signalling that that was the UK's future intention - would be &quot;a disaster&quot; according to Mr David.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last August, the UK government released a 13-page Brexit position paper in which it pledged to keep the UK &quot;fully involved&quot; in shaping EU data policy, starting from a point of &quot;unprecedented&quot; alignment at the point of exit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   Trading partners | How other nations deal with EU law                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The paper proposed that the UK's data authority, the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) to be &quot;fully involved in future EU regulatory dialogue&quot;, with an &quot;ongoing role&quot; for the ICO with the existing network of EU data protection authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It remains to be seen whether the EU will allow the UK any role in shaping regulations after Brexit - currently the European Commission is taking a very hard line - but tech bosses are now concerned this level of ambition may is fading under pressure from leading Brexiteers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr David concluded that there was now a growing risk that ideology might take precedence over expertise when setting policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&quot;It is time to listen to the experts,&quot; he added, &quot;The idea that we should have divergence on data protection rules is incorrect and unhelpful.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement, the Department for International trade referred to remarks from Mr Fox last August in which he welcomed the UK position paper on data flows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;With the UK at the forefront of the increasingly digitised global economy, the government is keen to prioritise key areas such as digital trade and investment as we leave the EU,&quot; he said at the time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Secure data flows between the UK and EU are crucial for our economic prosperity and these proposals give certainty to businesses and consumers that high protection standards will continue.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charlie Flanagan, the justice minister, is not thought of as naive or unrealistic. Yet here is what he had to say recently, when asked to justify the government's intention to exempt public bodies from fines if they are found to have breached the terms of the forthcoming EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I believe it's important in the context of public and state involvement that we lead by example here and that the state, all the public bodies and agencies attached thereto, would be fully compliant,&quot; he said. Is Flanagan seriously expecting good behaviour from public bodies if they can never face sanction? GDPR is an EU mega-regulation aimed at giving citizens back control of their personal data, while laying down rules for those hosting and processing that data. It is recognition by Europe - many would say belatedly and minimally - that the harvesting, storage and processing of personal information now takes place on a scale once unimaginable and that this is still growing exponentially.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GDPR is to be given legal expression here in the Data Protection Act 2018, with effect from May 25. It will entitle citizens who believe their personal data has been misused by, say, a bank, a sports club or an online retail company, to seek compensation through the courts. But the proposed exemption means that if a government department or, say, the HSE or Irish Water breaches an individual's data protection rights, it will effectively be beyond the reach of the courts. The implications here are enormous, since the information held by the state on individuals is likely to be vastly greater and more sensitive than data held by private businesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is unconscionable that the most powerful state agencies, funded by the taxpayer, should have control of individuals' most private information effectively without sanction in the event of misuse. Flanagan and most of his colleagues in government are long enough in public life to know that when the bureaucracy decides it wants to do something, talk of &quot;leading by example&quot; can go by the wayside. They know that moral suasion, on its own, will never ensure compliance with regulations by everyone who holds power. They know that what best moderates the actions of public bodies and institutions, just like private individuals, is fear of getting hit in the pocket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government's stance contradicts the wishes of Helen Dixon, the data protection commissioner, who has warned against any exemption for public bodies or authorities. She could see no basis for it, she told the Joint Oireachtas committee on justice last June, because &quot;arguably, higher standards in the protection of fundamental rights are demanded of those entities&quot;. Failure to provide for fines on public bodies would &quot;cancel out the deterrent effect&quot; of the legislation, she added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The committee supported her argument, having heard and rejected submissions from civil servants worried about the legal complexity of possible cases taken against public bodies and the potential drain on resources in the data commissioner's office. It recommended unambiguously that &quot;fines be administered to public bodies in breach of the new data-protection legislation where appropriate, to encourage compliance&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dixon said that because of Ireland's role as host to many of the world's leading information technology firms, her office will assume &quot;lead supervisory authority&quot; for EU operations. &quot;The message that the government has been sending out globally is that Ireland will be 'best in class', leading the way in European best practice in data protection regulation,&quot; she said. &quot;There will inevitably be a huge amount of scrutiny as to the domestic measures taken by the state to give effect to the GDPR.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She is correct. How can a government in Dublin credibly tell people in Silicon Valley, &quot;Do not as we do, when we are conducting our business, but do as we say, when you are conducting yours&quot;? No less sceptical will be citizens whom the state is urging to sign up to the Public Services Card (PSC) scheme. Simon McGarr, a leading privacy lawyer, has argued that the PSC already contravenes the GDPR and that law suits against the state could leave the taxpayer with a bill that could run &quot;into an unknowable number of zeros&quot;. If the present draft bill becomes law, there will probably be no such suits, of course. But many people will be wary of committing their information to the PSC scheme if there will be no sanction against any agency or employee of the state that misuses it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the government adheres to its proposed exemption for public bodies, it will also undermine Ireland's international credibility and ultimately hit the economy. It should follow the advice of the data protection commissioner, whose role includes providing guidance in navigating a way through this rapidly changing landscape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Flanagan has said the exemption for state bodies will &quot;be a matter of debate in the Oireachtas starting in the coming weeks&quot;. The legislation is still only in draft form. It can and should be amended.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The technology giants Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google have dominated the American stock market's growth for the past five years. But can their pre-eminence continue?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook's share price has risen by 364pc since the company floated in 2012, while holding Netflix shares for the past 10 years would have given you a 6,520pc return on your investment. Over the same period Alphabet, Google's parent company, has returned almost 300pc, Apple 814pc and Amazon 1,800pc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, investors are now questioning whether this rate of growth is sustainable. The most recent earnings announcements from the tech giants, collectively known as the &quot;Fangs&quot;, contained some worrying signs.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the Fangs are still growing, there are concerns about individual companies: Facebook's ability to grow its user base, for example, or whether the smartphone market has become too mature for Apple's exponential growth to continue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Professional investors are selling.Walter Price, manager of the &pound;326m Allianz Technology Trust, is one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is almost inevitable that their growth is going to slow as they have got so big,&quot; he said. &quot;When it comes to the Fangs we are more enthusiastic about Amazon and Netflix and a bit less enthusiastic about Facebook and Google.&quot; Mr Price has recently sold some of his Apple holding on the basis that the smartphone market is now too well developed. Last year Apple was among his top 10 holdings but it no longer features there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Allianz manager is not the only one to have concerns about Apple's future growth. Sales of the most recent iPhone X model missed market expectations when volumes of new iPhone sales fell by 1pc at the end of last year. Some put this down to the hefty $999 (&pound;710) price of the device.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook has come under the spotlight because of reports that users are spending less time on its platform. It has also come under fire for the damaging mental health effects of using the website, leading it to overhaul its newsfeed. Mr Price said he expected this overhaul to take up Facebook's resources in the coming months, but his main reason for reducing his stake was Europe's new wide-reaching data protection legislation. The EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) will force companies to be more transparent and get more approval for how they track customers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think Facebook and Google do a lot of tracking of people without their explicit permission, and under GDPR they are going to have to ask permission and customers will have the ability to be untracked,&quot; Mr Price said. &quot;That will impose a bit of a slowdown and an additional cost for those companies in the next six months.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nick Evans, a technology portfolio manager at Polar Capital, the fund group, is more upbeat about the tech giants' prospects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We expect the pace of growth to gradually slow for all companies as they become larger, but what makes many of the best technology companies sustain such high levels of growth is that great products drive strong customer usage trends and the resulting pricing power drives strong revenue growth,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, he is also investing in smaller, higher-growth companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have many small and mediumsized companies which are growing faster and are much less well known than the Fang stocks,&quot; Mr Evans said. In particular he is looking at machine learning and artificial intelligence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If we are correct, the influence of artificial intelligence over the next three to five years is likely to accelerate technology disruption, stimulate growth and act as a continued tailwind,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Price is investing in &quot;cloud computing&quot; firms - those that exploit the trend towards services delivered online. &quot;It's hitting its sweet spot in growth and corporate acceptance,&quot; he said. &quot;Companies such as Microsoft have been big in this sector, as has ServiceNow, and Workday is seeing easier and faster growth in this environment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One way to benefit from the growth of the tech giants without having direct exposure is to back companies that work with their products. For example, Chris Ford, who manages the Smith &amp; Williamson Artificial Intelligence fund, said he had invested in Roku, a platform through which you can access Netflix. Its software, which is built into some televisions and comes as an add-on with others, recommends content from different including Netflix, the user.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">recommend platforms, i tailored to t He is also regions suc investing in growing such as Latin America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MercadoLibre, a website that features of eBay and operates in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is the leader in La larger than Mr For eco in oa ecommerce market Latin America - it is much anyone else,&quot; he said. Ford pointed out that the ecommerce market was tiny the region, at around 1pc of sales, compared with around 15pc in the West, providing huge potential for growth. MercadoLibre has also been tipped by our Questor column.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The technology giants Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google have dominated the American stock market's growth for the&nbsp;past five years. But can their&nbsp; pre-eminence continue?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook's share price has risen by 364pc since the company floated in 2012, while holding Netflix shares for the past 10 years would have given you a 6,520pc return on your investment. Over the same period Alphabet, Google's parent company, has returned almost 300pc, Apple 814pc and Amazon 1,800pc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, investors are now questioning whether this rate of growth is sustainable. The most recent earnings announcements from the tech giants, collectively known as the &quot;Fangs&quot;, contained some worrying signs.&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the Fangs are still growing, there are concerns about individual companies: Facebook's ability to grow its user base, for example, or whether the smartphone market has become too mature for Apple's exponential growth to continue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Professional investors are selling. Walter Price, manager of the &pound;326m Allianz Technology Trust, is one.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is almost inevitable that their growth is going to slow as they have got so big,&quot; he said. &quot;When it comes to the Fangs we are more enthusiastic about Amazon and Netflix and a bit less enthusiastic about Facebook and Google.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   Buy these seven shares to profit from driverless cars and artificial intelligence                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Price has recently sold some of his Apple holding on the basis that the smartphone market is now too well developed. Last year Apple was among his top 10 holdings but it no longer features there.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Allianz manager is not the only one to have concerns about Apple's future growth. Sales of the most recent iPhone X model missed market expectations when volumes of new  iPhone sales fell by 1pc at the end of last year . Some put this down to the hefty $999 (&pound;710) price of the device.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook has come under the spotlight because of reports that users are spending less time on its platform . It has also come under fire for the damaging mental health effects of using the website, leading it to overhaul its newsfeed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Price said he expected this overhaul to take up Facebook's resources in the coming months, but his main reason for reducing his stake was Europe's new wide-reaching data protection legislation. The EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) will force companies to be more transparent and get more approval for how they track customers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think Facebook and Google do a lot of tracking of people without their explicit permission, and under GDPR they are going to have to ask permission and customers will have the ability to be untracked,&quot; Mr Price said. &quot;That will impose a bit of a slowdown and an additional cost for those companies in the next six months.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nick Evans, a technology portfolio manager at Polar Capital, the fund group, is more upbeat about the tech giants' prospects.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We expect the pace of growth to gradually slow for all companies as they become larger, but what makes many of the best technology companies sustain such high levels of growth is that great products drive strong customer usage trends and the resulting pricing power drives strong revenue growth,&quot; he said. However, he is also investing in smaller, higher-growth companies.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have many small and medium-sized companies which are growing faster and are much less well known than the Fang stocks,&quot; Mr Evans said. In particular he is looking at machine learning and artificial intelligence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If we are correct, the influence of artificial intelligence over the next three to five years is likely to accelerate technology disruption, stimulate growth and act as a continued tailwind,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Price is investing in &quot;cloud computing&quot; firms - those that exploit the trend towards services delivered online. &quot;It's hitting its sweet spot in growth and corporate acceptance,&quot; he said. &quot;Companies such as Microsoft have been big in this sector, as has ServiceNow, and Workday is seeing easier and faster growth in this environment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One way to benefit from the growth of the tech giants without having direct exposure is to back companies that work with their products.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, Chris Ford, who manages the Smith &amp; Williamson Artificial Intelligence fund, said he had invested in Roku, a platform through which you can access Netflix. Its software, which is built into some televisions and comes as an add-on with others, recommends content from different platforms, including Netflix, tailored to the user.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is also investing in growing regions such as Latin America. MercadoLibre, a website that combines features of eBay and Amazon, operates in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is the ecommerce market leader in Latin America - it is much larger than anyone else,&quot; he said. Mr Ford pointed out that the ecommerce market was tiny in the region, at around 1pc of sales, compared with around 15pc in the West, providing huge potential for growth. MercadoLibre has also been tipped by our Questor column.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johnny Hornby saw nothing remotely satisfying when Unilever threatened this week to withdraw ads from Google and Facebook unless they properly policed extremist content on their platforms. The ad industry chief had been warning of just such a boycott for years, but didn't see this as a &quot;told you so&quot; moment. There's too much at stake.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has been, the founder of The&amp;Partnership argues, something akin to &quot;the wild west with YouTube [owned by Google] and Facebook. If they are going to take people's advertising money, it's their duty to ensure that their media inventory is safe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the old media world, if somebody had sprayed swastikas on one of his posters, he would have had it down within the hour. So why can't digital platforms do the same and make sure that adverts do not appear alongside unpalatable or illegal content? He has little time for the excuse that with 400 hours of content uploaded to YouTube every minute, it's hard to police it all.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They don't need to enable the entire inventory to accept advertising. They could say, 'We will check the inventory and only when we know it's 100 per cent clear will we enable it to receive your advertising.' If behaving well means the tech platforms making less money, it's a price they should be willing to pay.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His warning against the two technology giants, which together account for more than half of Britain's digital advertising market, had focused on advertising fraud, where criminals create fake traffic of absolutely no value to advertisers. The scams are estimated to cost the industry $16.4billion a year. Yet Mr Hornby believes that, finally, the penny has dropped with Facebook and Google. &quot;They've had a very good scare. They have genuinely recognised that if they want to take advertising, they have probably not got many more goes at this.&quot; Now representatives from the two companies visit him and his rivals virtually every week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Already, however, the industry's attention is being diverted to new threats from different directions, not least the arrival on its doorstep of the big professional services and accountancy firms. Accenture, Deloitte, KPMG, McKinsey and PWC have been buying up ad agencies to take advantage of a seismic shift in the business landscape - &quot;They have bought two or three times the number of digital advertising agencies in the US than the traditional holding companies have&quot;. And they also have an early advantage: the first people to get their foot in the door when corporations begin digital transformations are the Deloittes and Accentures of this world, who now like to roll in advertising as an additional service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then there is the advent of Europe's new GDPR data protection rules, which come into force in May. These herald another disruption to the advertising industry, tightening the rules on buying and selling customer data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These extra competitive pressures could not have come at a worst time for adland's big holding companies, which had a terrible 2017. WPP, Publicis, Omnicom and Interpublic all suffered significant drops in their share prices as big consumer goods companies cut back on advertising.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Against this backdrop The&amp;Partnership, which is 49 per cent-owned by WPP, doubled its revenue last year to &pound;457 million and added brands such as Netflix to its client list, which also includes Toyota and News UK, publisher of The Times. It did this by adopting an unconventional &quot;full service&quot; approach, which brings together a package of services (media buying, data analytics, PR, creative and more) into one team with a single bottom line for each client. The teams then work in the client's offices, acting like rapid response units.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Hornby cites his company's work for Toyota in Paris, where petrol and diesel cars are banned on days when the temperature tops 32C: &quot;My team inside Toyota can see the weather forecast and if it's going to be really hot they can move all of the media money to early drivetime radio and tell every Parisian that if they drive a Toyota hybrid vehicle they are not affected by the ban.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charming and chatty, Mr Hornby, 50, has been described as the smoothest act in adland. He displays an engaging mix of self-satisfaction and self-deprecating humour, neatly reflected in his anecdote of what a typical Hornby family Christmas might look like. &quot;Nick [his halfbrother Nick Hornby, the novelist] might say, 'Oh, I've written this book about my obsession with Arsenal and it's going to be made into a movie and I'm going to be played by Colin Firth.' Gill [his sister Gill Hornby, the novelist] might say, 'I've written a novel about women at the school gates called The Hive.' Robert [Robert Harris, the novelist, married to Gill] might say, 'I've written a story about Hitler having won the war and a bungling detective in the Sixties uncovering the fact that there was a holocaust.' And I would say, 'We've propelled a man into a load of fruit with the line, &quot;You know when you've been Tangoed.&quot; Everyone would laugh at me, apart from my mother, who would say, 'Well done, darling, aren't you clever.' &quot; His mother is Sonia Beesley, the BBC journalist who got Margaret Thatcher to reveal that, as prime minister, she found time in the middle of the night to darn her husband Denis's socks. His late father was the industrialist Sir Derek Hornby, chairman of Rank-Xerox and the British Overseas Trade Board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Christmas anecdote speaks volumes about the frustrations of a man with a gilded life who harbours demons deep down. He seems profoundly disturbed about the dysfunctional state of British and American politics. He hates Brexit, President Trump and the Tories and is in despair about the Labour party's takeover by the hard Left.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think John McDonnell is the baddy, probably more than Corbyn, who is the mad old uncle. They will try to get out anybody who has a sniff of David Milliband about them,&quot; he says. This is, after all, the ad man who helped Tony Blair's new Labour to hold on to office in 2001 and 2005 and who remains a close associate of Lord (Peter) Mandelson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So why not run for office himself? Any temptation is fleeting: &quot;What I would love to do is to support through what I do well - marketing and branding - whoever the next Tony Blair is. If somebody emerged, a centrist, preferably for me centre left, with the next third way, I would love to lend my hand to help to make that happen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q&amp;A</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Who is your mentor?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My late father, Sir Derek Hornby. In any difficult situation I ask myself what he would do ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Does money motivate you?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whenever people think about money too much, things will go sour, whereas people who pursue innovative ideas with passion find they will be the better off in the end.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook's failure to make people aware that it was collecting their data for advertising purposes&nbsp;was illegal,&nbsp;a German court has found.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Berlin Regional Court ruled&nbsp;that Facebook did not obtain consent from its users to use their information for its advertising goals, in accordance with German data protection law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ruling was seen as a win for the Federation of German Consumer Organisation, who have been locked in battle with the social network since 2015,&nbsp;claiming it breached consumer protection law because data sharing settings were turned on by default.&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Facebook hides default settings that are not privacy-friendly in its privacy centre and does not provide sufficient information about this when users register,&quot; said the federation's litigation policy officer Heiko D&uuml;nkel.&nbsp; &quot;This does not meet the requirement for informed consent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tech giant stores information that a person has shared on their profile, through their activity on the website but also their web history while browsing other websites.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook claims that users are made aware of what information it collects under its terms and conditions and that it allows people an easy way to manage their privacy settings.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But judges ruled that all five of default privacy settings, which were investigated after the&nbsp;consumer watchdog raised concerns,&nbsp;were not lawful, as they did not constitute consent. One example included default location services, which are &nbsp;already activated in the Facebook app with&nbsp;&quot;ticks&quot;&nbsp;already placed in boxes that allowed search engines to link to the user's timeline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court found that a further eight clauses in Facebook's terms of use were invalid. These included pre-formulated declarations of consent for Facebook to use the name and profile picture of users &quot;for commercial, sponsored or related content&quot; and to transfer their data to the US.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, it did not find any fault with Facebook's marketing as a &quot;free&quot; app. The watchdog objected to the use of the word because, according to D&uuml;nkel, &quot;Consumers do pay to use Facebook. Maybe not in euros, but with their data. And this data is extremely valuable to the company.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   Google, Facebook digital ad spend                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook said it would appeal the judgement, but it has implications for incoming General Data Protection Regulations which will come into force in May.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are reviewing this recent decision carefully and are pleased that the court agreed with us on a number of issues. Our products and policies have changed a lot since this case was brought, and further changes to our terms and Data Policy are anticipated later this year in light of upcoming changes to the law,&quot; a spokesman said.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We work hard to ensure that our policies are clear and easy to understand, and that all aspects of the Facebook Service are in compliance with applicable law.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Companies found to be in breach of GDPR face a maximum penalty of 4pc of global annual turnover or (EURO)20m (&pound;17.77m), dependant on which is greater. The new laws will replace the EU's Data Protection Act, granting more power to punish companies that fail to comply with new rules, which will allow individuals to withdraw consent over the information being used. Companies will need a paper trail that proves it collected personal information lawfully.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Facebook&nbsp;announced more &quot;transparent&quot; privacy tools in anticipation of&nbsp;the European crackdown at the beginning of 2018. Although it did not make it entirely clear how it would show people how it tracks them around other websites.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest transparency drive is one of several sweeping changes to how it communicates with users about its data collection, including a &quot;privacy checkup&quot; and privacy portal, all in response to incoming European data privacy laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In light of the new regulation, all eyes will be on Google, Twitter, Snapchat and Instagram, companies that have amassed huge sets of consumer data over the past years and will be expected to show exactly how they retrieved information, and whether each person agreed to their doing so.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Siobhan Mockler first came across General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in a Sunday newspaper last May. She had never heard of it. Her bosses at Copymoore, a 25-year-old office equipment business, had never heard of it either.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Already busy as the company's marketing executive, Mockler was put in charge of GDPR compliance. &quot;I really shot myself in the foot with that one,&quot; she said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet it worked out tremendously. Copymoore is now fully GDPR compliant, and Mockler provides consultancy services to her SME clients on the same subject.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The vast majority don't think it will have an impact on them,&quot; she said. An engineering firm told her the new rules did not apply, as it did not keep client data. &quot;If it stores data on employees, then they do,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GDPR comes into force on May 25. That is not much time to prepare for &quot;a very complex piece of legislation&quot;, said Geraldine Keehan, a lawyer with Augustus Cullen Law, who felt businesses were taking a &quot;head in the sand&quot; approach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The EU regulations create new data responsibilities for companies, give the public with new data rights - and, unlike in the previous regime, breaches can result in penalties of up to 4% of turnover.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Part of the reason small businesses have been slow to prepare for GDPR is because of the word &quot;data&quot;, said Brian Honan, a cyber-security consultant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It would have been better called the General Human Protection Regulation, because it's not about protecting data,&quot; he said, &quot;it's about protecting humans by protecting the data that is out there about them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If, for example, a staff member loses a mobile phone with client data on it, you need to know how to respond.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But if SMEs are sluggish about GDPR, consumers are not. According to a survey from software company SAS, more than three-quarters (77%) of Irish adults plan to activate new rights over their personal data, including (66%) looking at the right to erase personal data held about them. More than one in four (26%) plan to do this in May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While social media companies and financial services organisations topped the poll (62%) of businesses that people said they would request to remove personal data, 41% of respondents said they would also request personal data to be removed from small businesses such as retailers. Some 38% said they would request access to their personal data from cyrrent and previous employers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;GDPR is the bane of my life,&quot; said Michael FitzGerald, founder of OnePage CRM, a sales application for small businesses. At almost every internal meeting he attends these days &quot;it comes up - someone will say, 'What about the implications for GDPR?'&quot; The Galway business has clients around the world, many in the US. As a result of GDPR, FitzGerald is splitting its database and building a new server so the company can have one database in Europe, under GDPR, and one in the US, which has different data protection rules.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He can foresee other issues. Cloudbased systems are increasingly designed to work together, with customer relationship management systems working alongside help desk software, or connecting to tools such as Mail Chimp. &quot;You could end up synchronised between your own system and a system in the US, which is going to open up a whole new can of worms,&quot; said FitzGerald.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The implication for lead generation is another area of concern. &quot;A load of AI [artificial intelligence] systems are being created with the express purpose of building up profiles on people, and that's going to go head to head with GDPR,&quot; he said. &quot;That's just client-facing stuff. There are all your internal documentation processes to consider too, and people to be trained up to respond to instances where customers say, 'I want to retrieve all my data.'&quot; This last could give &quot;powers to trolls&quot; to put businesses through hoops. &quot;What's to stop them from asking to retrieve data multiple times a year?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such concerns are now coming to the fore at the Small Firms Association (SFA), which is running a series of GDPR information events, the next on March 9. &quot;For our first one in January, we were afraid very few people would turn up. In the end, 150 people did,&quot; said SFA director Sven Spollen-Behrens, who sees interest growing as the deadline approaches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Members want to know the practical steps they need to take to be compliant. The SFA has created a tool to help on its website. &quot;It is just a bunch of spreadsheets but it allows people to put a structure on the task ahead of them,&quot; he said. GDPR compliance also requires businesses to use language in websites and in documents that is easily understood. VisibleThread was set up in 2008 and to date has worked mostly with US state agencies. According to the software company's chief executive, Fergal McGovern, the advent of GDPR is driving demand from European SMEs too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clear terms and conditions will also protect businesses in the event of litigation. &quot;If a customer isn't going to read a simple set of terms and conditions, then that will by and large be seen by a judge as their fault,&quot; said McGovern.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But if the terms and conditions are opaque, the fault will be seen to reside with the business.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Privacy policies must clearly explain what data you are collecting and for what purpose. If you do not have permission for the data you are holding, this must be sought. Noncompliance could prevent your business winning public contracts. &quot;Increasingly, we are seeing that GDPR or formal policies around data protection are part of the standard terms and conditions of a tender,&quot; said Tony Corrigan of TenderScout. &quot;Many tenders will place the buyers in a position where they have to deal with personal data, they can be expected to put the onus for compliance onto the supplier as part of the tender qualification criteria.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On a recent Bus Eireann contract, a client contracted a GDPR consultant to audit its systems and put in place a GDPRreadiness strategy to ensure that the company was eligible to compete for the contract, said Corrigan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, being GDPR-ready is a differentiator for most businesses, but after May I expect it to be a mandatory requirement for many tenders for government contracts,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most businesses collect digital data about their customers. Whether a hi-tech start-up or an online florist, they store sensitive information such as addresses and credit card or bank details.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A new European Union regulation on this wealth of information has the potential to cause trouble for entrepreneurs. The general data protection regulation (GDPR), which was adopted in 2016 and comes into force on May 25, will give people the right to access any information about themselves held by companies. The maximum penalty for breaching the rules will be (EURO)20m (&pound;17.5m) or 4% of global turnover, whichever is higher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though it is a Brussels regulation, the provisions are included in the Data Protection Bill, currently going through the Houses of Parliament, so it will be unaffected by Brexit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GDPR will apply to all businesses that store personal details. Despite this, nearly a third of directors are unaware of the shake-up, according to a survey by the Institute of Directors. Stephen Bailey of the cyber-security consultancy NCC said: &quot;We're surprised at how little notice business owners have taken of GDPR.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Companies may not be aware of how much data they hold, not only on customers, but also on job applicants and suppliers, for example. Bailey said it was essential to make data easily searchable. &quot;The Information Commissioner's Office will accept no excuse for those that fail to do so as there's been two years to prepare.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most businesses collect digital data about their customers. Whether a hi-tech start-up or an online florist, they store sensitive information such as addresses and credit card or bank details.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A new European Union regulation on this wealth of information has the potential to cause trouble for entrepreneurs. The general data protection regulation (GDPR), which was adopted in 2016 and comes into force on May 25, will give people the right to access any information about themselves held by companies. The maximum penalty for breaching the rules will be (EURO)20m (&pound;17.5m) or 4% of global turnover, whichever is higher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though it is a Brussels regulation, the provisions are included in the Data Protection Bill, currently going through the Houses of Parliament, so it will be unaffected by Brexit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GDPR will apply to all businesses that store personal details. Despite this, nearly a third of directors are unaware of the shake-up, according to a survey by the Institute of Directors. Stephen Bailey of the cyber-security consultancy NCC said: &quot;We're surprised at how little notice business owners have taken of GDPR.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Companies may not be aware of how much data they hold, not only on customers, but also on job applicants and suppliers, for example. Bailey said it was essential to make data easily searchable. &quot;The Information Commissioner's Office will accept no excuse for those that fail to do so as there's been two years to prepare.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Although large businesses, BT included, collectively succeed in blocking billions of cyberattacks every year, no business can ever claim to be 100 per cent secure. The sheer scale of the global cybercrime industry and the rapid rate of evolving threats mean that developing a robust cybersecurity strategy should be a priority for businesses of all types and sizes.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As our use of technology is constantly changing and creating new challenges, so too are the tools and methods being employed by cybercriminals. To stay ahead, and to comply with the new GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) that comes into force in May, organisations need to adopt an informationcentric approach to security, gaining a full understanding of where their sensitive data resides, how it's stored, how it's transmitted through the network and who has access to it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While there is no one-size-fits-all approach for addressing the challenges and opportunities posed by cybercrime, businesses must get the basics right: strong passwords, firewalls, antivirus software, regular patching and training for sta. Outsourcing some aspects of your IT security estate to a trusted partner can also help businesses bolster their defences. Our report, &quot;The Cyber Security Journey - From Denial to Opportunity&quot;, gives advice to help businesses prepare for the future of cybercrime.'</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook has found a way to determine a users' social class, using a method which proves to be&nbsp;far more sophisticated than a perusal of the members signed up to its&nbsp;Avocado Appreciation Society page.&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The social network has plans to train its artificially intelligent algorithms to predict whether someone is &quot;working class&quot;, &quot;middle class&quot; or &quot;upper class&quot; dependent on a variety of factors, according to&nbsp;patent filing published in February.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These factors include the amount of devices a person has signed into the social network on - with more devices suggesting greater wealth. Others include a person's&nbsp;location, their level of education and their travel history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is unclear whether Facebook is actively using the class prediction tool currently but it is transparent about how it groups its two billion users into&nbsp;demographics for targeted advertising.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, its computer algorithms judge whether a person is more likely to be susceptible to travel advertising if they have tagged themselves in different locations and liked pages about travel.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is also able to track a person's digital footprint and could detect, for example, if someone has been viewing external travel websites while they are logging into Facebook.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Travel companies will pay Facebook to send targeted adverts to that group of people. &nbsp;While users can remove themselves from these categories under its privacy controls, the feature is&nbsp;turned on by default.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the patent design ever makes an appearance, Facebook may have to tweak its data collection methods&nbsp;to make sure it is&nbsp;compliant with the new General Data Protection Regulation, coming in next year. Companies found to be in breach of GDPR face a maximum penalty of 4pc of global annual turnover or (EURO)20m (&pound;17.77m), dependant on which is greater.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new laws will replace the EU's Data Protection Act, granting more power to punish companies that fail to comply with new rules, which will allow individuals to withdraw consent over the information being used. Companies will need a paper trail that proves it collected personal information lawfully.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Legal actions could start within weeks and it has been claimed the authorities might have to pay out billions of euro.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cost of the cards scheme has topped (EURO)60million and been criticised as an invasion of individuals' privacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Solicitor Simon McGarr yesterday told an Oireachtas Committee the PSCs fall foul of the EU's General Data Protection Regulation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added: &quot;The GDPR is ticking down to coming into force in May, what that allows for is that States will be liable for non-financial loss breaches of data protection rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If it is the case that it [the PSC scheme] is not compliant - and we're told it contains approximately three million people's details - that would indicate each one of those three million people have a claim on the State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">REMEDY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the remedy has not been set out in the terms of the GDPR, it's a remedy in terms of financial compensation, that's available through the courts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Any number, the court might consider appropriate for that type of breach multiplied by three million is a very large number.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Irish Council for Civil Liberties has called for at least the suspension of the PSC project as it has serious concerns that it exceeds its remit and is not necessary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It said: &quot;The Government has failed to respond to the clear privacy concerns regarding the PSC and has instead invested further funds for promoting a project already over budget.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Department of Social Protection statement said it does not accept Mr McGarr's claims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It added: &quot;The Department is satisfied that there is a comprehensive legal basis in place for registering people's identity and for the sharing of that identity data with specified public bodies.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amazon, Google and Apple are all in the running to become the first ever company to be valued at one trillion dollars, with analysts believing we could see history being made as early as this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Becoming a &quot;trillion dollar company&quot; has implications beyond than the business world. It could cement customer loyalty to these brands, enhancing a perception of quality. It will also throw up myriad questions about competition, regulation, and privacy. Greater scale could mean these companies are able to create more creative products and services. We could see technology giants like Apple ramping up their aims to tackle major healthcare issues like diabetes, or Google stepping up its secretive artificial intelligence division. On the other hand, greater ability to buy out rivals could grant a single company more power than ever before, and is a potential concern for governments struggling to regulate new technologies. &quot;We tend to forget what a $1 trillion market cap means: that's 1,000 unicorns,&quot; says Thomas Husson, research analyst at Gartner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Daily Telegraph has delved into the economics behind three big names in technology: Google, Amazon and Apple for clues as to which one will hit the historic milestone first.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amazon: Strengths Amazon reported the largest profit in its history on Thursday evening. The retailer drew millions of new customers to its Prime subscription, which offers next-day delivery and other benefits including its Netflixstyle streaming. Shares rose more than 6pc and chief executive, Jeff Bezos, now the richest man in the world, added billions to his fortune. Amazon could be on course to take the trillion mark thanks to its mammoth presence and a series of smart, future-proof investments, which have set a foundation upon which the company is certain to soar. Amazon is widely recognised as transforming retail through its marketplace, but it also has a consumer electronics division and a booming cloud storage company - all ripe for future growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Weaknesses Amazon has failed to fully crack the entertainment market and its streaming service, Amazon Prime Video, has yet to overtake Netflix despite big investments in exclusive series like Mr Robot. It makes famously paltry profits given its size and has yet to pay a dividend. Amazon is the largest cloud provider - providing computing power needed for businesses around the world. But just as large enterprises were considering paying Amazon a fee to host all its systems and data rather instead of using servers on their premise, the Spectre bug hit the headlines. Prospective AWS customers may be thinking twice about placing their sensitive information into a shared cloud if they believe there is even the smallest chance it might be visible to others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opportunities Amazon has correctly singled out the demand for near instant shipping as consumers turn to online shopping. Huge investments in its super-fast delivery service, including using drones to deliver packages within 30 minutes, will keep customers visiting www.Amazon.co.uk even if competitors step up e-commerce. Amazon is also growing its advertising offering, which grew 60pc in the last quarter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Threats A failure to tackle music and entertainment issues might sink its voice assistant smart speakers. Amazon Echo devices could be challenged by Apple's HomePod, due to launch next week. Plus, an ongoing feud with Google may throw a spanner in the works. The row saw Google remove YouTube from Amazon's Echo and Fire streaming devices. Without popular streaming apps, the smart speakers could fall out of favour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Google: Strengths Google, now a subsidiary of parent company Alphabet, is one of the most recognised brands in the world. Its primary business as the information sorter of choice and miner of the world's data to be converted into ad revenue is likely to continue for the foreseeable future, and it has the cash to absorb rival technologies that threaten it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Weaknesses Google has seen its traffic acquisition costs rising over the past 12 months, which could spell trouble for 2018. These costs are payments sent to other companies to direct consumer and business traffic to its website. Consumers are increasingly searching across a mix of mobile, desktop and tablets, bumping up costs, so much so that rising advertising revenues toward the end of 2017 were not enough to offset them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In light of this Google announced surprisingly disappointing earnings on Thursday evening, sparking a share price drop. &quot;Alphabet is heavily, heavily reliant on Google advertising revenue and there is creeping competition in the advertising business (Facebook for some time, and Amazon also creeping in),&quot; says Forrester analyst Colin Colburn. &quot;So that will be an interesting story to see how it plays out over the coming quarters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opportunities Google has expanded into cloud storage and consumer electronics to rival Apple. Its flagship smartphone, the Google Pixel 2, was widely regarded as one of the best phones on the market upon its launch in October last year, and a worthy opponent to the iPhone X. Its purchase of smartphone manufacturer HTC suggests big plans for its hardware division. In its latest earnings report, Google said hardware sales doubled on the same period last year. Though we have been here before: it bought Motorola for $12.5bn in 2012 and sold it for $2.9bn two years later, having extracted the patents it wanted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Threats Extremism, hate speech and cyber bullying have put Google in the spotlight. These have transformed its perception from a Californian start-up done good to a negligent platform that puts users in harm's way. Despite promising sales of its smart speaker after its launch in the end of 2017, which was boosted by heavy discounts, it might struggle to contend with Amazon's Echo and the new HomePod.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Data, once widely regarded as &quot;the new oil&quot; might cause Google to come unstuck. Incoming General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) may see a clamping down on how information Google retrieves through its search engine, Android operating system and smart speaker can be used.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Google falls foul of GDPR it faces a maximum penalty of 4pc of global annual turnover or (EURO)20m (&pound;17.6m), depending on which is greater. Meanwhile increasing pressure from regulators and the European Union could suck up more cash, with Google forced to pay up billions of dollars in antitrust fines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apple: Strengths Apple is the world's biggest company, overtaking South Korean electronics giant Samsung to become the largest seller of smartphones. On Thursday evening, it posted the largest quarterly profit of all time, despite a fall in iPhone sales. A company that sells less, but earns more, signals greater things to come. Sales for Apple Watch and Apple TV have also improved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Weaknesses Depending on how you interpret the results, selling fewer of the expensive iPhone X is either genius or a red flag. Generally, appetite for smartphones appears to be falling slightly, which means Apple may no longer be able to count on huge sales every year it brings out a new version. Sales of Apple Mac computers have also fallen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opportunities Apple's hotly anticipated HomePod will launch next week, with the company taking a big step into the market for smart speakers. The &pound;319 smart speaker will take on Amazon's Echo and Google Home, costing significantly more than both. But it is likely to appeal to its core customer base, who are looking for high quality design and sound.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Threats Apple has also suffered a bad press. It apologised after it emerged that it was slowing down iPhones with older batteries, a suspicion long held by customers who were convinced they were being nudged to buy newer models. Apple said that it slowed older batteries to stop phones from shutting down by throttling them in a software update last year. It is now offering discounts on its battery replacement service. &quot;Extraordinary growth and bigger profit than we've seen before means Apple is definitely on track to be a trillion,&quot; says Sucharita Kodali, analyst at Forrester. &quot;First or not remains to be seen.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">736 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In September, I warned in a Guardian opinion article that the Brexit process could have the effect of allowing the UK government to bring in more draconian and discriminatory immigration laws, harking back to the 70s and 80s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many people wondered how this would happen and the answer was that Brexit would allow the sweeping away of advances like the abolition of the hated primary purpose immigration rule made illegal by the European court of justice.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But now a far more profound and deliberate line of attack is being adopted by the British government in its national immigration policy, under cover of implementing the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), one of the biggest modernisations of data protection law anywhere in the world. Simply put, a new clause in the government's data protection bill, which implements the GDPR, would remove the rights of people who are subject to an immigration procedure to know what public authorities hold about them and to rectify or delete erroneous or unlawfully collected personal data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UK government is acting under the cover of the complexity of data protection law and the chaotic Brexit negotiations</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It would affect individuals who are not UK nationals, including nationals of EU member states resident in the UK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is an alarming development and anyone who understands immigration law or data protection will realise that this makes it impossible for individuals involved in immigration disputes to obtain their personal information from the Home Office, something which is essential to any administrative dispute. In addition, these measures would also potentially affect the 3 million EU citizens who will soon face new processes to register their residence after Brexit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We know the deliberate intent of the government here, because similar blanket exemptions have been attempted before but rejected by the House of Commons as far back as 1983. The then home secretary Leon Brittan wanted to make immigration control &quot; a legitimate category for exemption &quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was roundly condemned in parliament at a time when discriminatory immigration rules were otherwise accepted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The discriminatory situation being created is being seen with great concern in the European parliament. The UK data protection authority and digital rights organisations are sounding the alarm because of how this measure would disproportionately interfere with the fundamental rights of non-nationals resident in the UK. This would mean that the UK would not uphold the adequate levels of protection required for the exchange of personal data between the UK and other EU states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Home Office pays out &pound;15,500 to asylum seeker over data breach</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not only do these proposals stand to flout the important fundamental rights protections of millions of individuals, in the process undermining the already low level of trust of EU citizens in the UK with regard to their rights, they would also lower the UK's chances of obtaining an adequacy arrangement with the EU. This would also make it harder for the UK to continue to obtain information from several EU information systems, in particular those related to immigration, because of the lack of adequate protection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the UK fails to obtain an adequacy arrangement from the EU, it would lose free access to data from nations such as the US, which has negotiated an agreement with the EU called the EU-US Privacy Shield. This would have major real-world economic and commercial impact on the UK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, in essence, what is happening here is that the UK government, under the cover of the complexity of data protection law in particular, and its chaotic Brexit negotiations in general, is seeking to create damaging new discriminatory national immigration restrictions. In addition, the government is undermining the implementation of the most important piece of EU data protection law ever drafted, which will have the knock-on effect of undermining the ability of the UK to ensure the free flow of data post-Brexit. This, as people will have seen this week, could have major economic and security implications for the UK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This issue should alarm all those who care about human rights, a fair immigration system, and a professional and transparent implementation of data protection rules in the UK.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEWS; Version:1</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">654 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Government departments should be more worried about teenage bedroom hackers than state-sponsored cyber terrorists, the Information Commissioner has warned.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a speech to the heads of the civil service and other public bodies, Elizabeth Denham said that most breaches are preventable and bosses should consider the reputational&nbsp;damage as well as financial losses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;But rather than panicking about rogue states such as Russia hacking into their systems, civil servants should plan to protect themselves against&nbsp;teenage boys who attack simply to show that they are able to, the regulator warned.&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We make a mistake if we throw up our hands and worry about state sponsored attacks - we know those are rare,&quot; Ms Denham said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You should be worrying about the malicious kid in his bedroom who hacks in to your system because he can. Or the opportunistic thief who understands the value of the data you hold and knows how to get his hands on it. Because you left the door wide open.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her comments come amid rising concern about the impact of a state-sponsored attack on Britain's public services, particularly from Russia. Boris Johnson, the Foreign Secretary, recently warned the Kremlin that Britain would react in kind to any cyber attack.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In reality many of the most high profile attacks have proven to come from much less powerful sources.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kane Gamble, who is currently awaiting sentence, was just 15 when he gained access to the computers of America's top spy chiefs, including the head of CIA, from his Leicestershire bedroom. &nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Denham told the Association of Chief Executives and the Public Chairs' Forum that despite complaints about resources in the public sector, cyber breaches such as the Wannacry attack on the NHS cost more in the long run .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The international ransomware attack disrupted &nbsp;more than a third of trusts in England and saw 6,900 NHS appointments cancelled.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Denham said: &quot;I ask you to consider the risks. Think of the true cost of a cyber breach, for example.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It will cost you money but it will also cost you your reputation, trust, social licence. This is collateral damage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yet most cyber breaches and attacks are preventable. The high profile attacks on TalkTalk and Carphone Warehouse would not have happened if they had put rudimentary protections in place. And if NHS systems had been patched and up to date, they would have been protected from Wannacry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The  EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a framework with greater scope and much tougher punishments for those who fail to comply with new rules around the storage and handling of personal data, will replace the Data Protection Act in May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Denham said that the new regulations brings the legislation &quot;in line with our 21st century world&quot;.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It gives greater control to people about how their data is used and it compels organisations to be transparent and account for their actions,&quot; she said during the speech on Friday.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She added: &quot;This is about restoring trust and confidence. Only one in five people in the UK trust organisations to look after their data. That's not good enough.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), which is responsible for punishing any breaches of the rules, will receive more reports of cyber security breaches and more complaints as people are more aware of their rights, she said.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sometimes when I speak to the private sector, I can sense the panic, but also the incentive to get it right. So many businesses feel like they are starting from scratch - it's one of the reasons why we've set up helplines and targeted resources to help them prepare,&quot; Ms Denham said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&quot;Sometimes when I speak to the public sector, I can sense complacency. Because you know data protection. It's been part of the furniture for years. Now it's time to redecorate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She encouraged bosses to take the opportunity to retrain their staff and to open up transparency and accountability on how personal information is used.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amazon, Google and Apple are all in the running to become the first ever company to be valued at one trillion dollars, with analysts believing&nbsp;we could see history being made as early as this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Becoming a &quot;trillion dollar company&quot; will have implications beyond than the business world. It could cement customer&nbsp;loyalty to these brands, enhancing a&nbsp;perception of quality. It will also throw up myriad questions about competition, regulation, and privacy.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Greater scale could mean these companies are able to create&nbsp;more creative products and services. We could see technology giants like Apple ramping up their aims to tackle major healthcare issues like diabetes, or Google stepping up its secretive&nbsp; artificial intelligence division .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the other hand, greater ability to buy out rivals could grant a single company more power than ever before, and is a potential concern for governments struggling to regulate new technologies. &quot;We tend to forget what a $1 trillion market cap means: that's 1,000 unicorns,&quot; says Thomas Husson, research analyst at Gartner.&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   The race to one trillion dollars - Apple Google and Amazon                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Daily Telegraph has delved into the economics behind three big names in technology: Google, Amazon and Apple for clues as to which one will hit the historic milestone first.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   Amazon                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Strengths</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amazon reported the largest profit in its history on Thursday evening. The retailer drew millions of new customers to its Prime subscription, which offers next-day delivery and other benefits including its Netflix-style streaming. Shares rose more than 6pc and chief executive, Jeff Bezos, now the richest man in the world, added billions to his fortune.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amazon could be on course to take the trillion mark thanks to its mammoth presence and a series of smart, future-proof investments, which have set a foundation upon which the company is certain to soar. Amazon is widely recognised as transforming retail through its marketplace, but it also has a consumer electronics division and a booming cloud storage company - all ripe for future growth.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   Alexa products compared                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Weaknesses</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amazon has failed to fully crack the&nbsp;entertainment market&nbsp;and its streaming service, Amazon Prime Video, has yet to overtake&nbsp;Netflix despite big investments in exclusive series like&nbsp;Mr Robot. It makes famously paltry profits given its size and has yet to pay a dividend. Amazon is the largest cloud provider - providing computing power needed for businesses around the world. But just as large enterprises were considering&nbsp;paying Amazon a fee to host all its systems and data rather instead of&nbsp;using servers on their premise, the Spectre bug hit the headlines. Prospective AWS customers may be thinking twice about placing their sensitive information into a shared cloud if they believe there is even the smallest chance it might be visible to others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opportunities&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amazon has correctly singled out the demand for near instant shipping as consumers turn to online shopping. Huge investments in its super-fast delivery service, including using drones to deliver packages within 30 minutes, will keep customers visiting Amazon.co.uk even if competitors step up e-commerce. Amazon is also growing&nbsp;its advertising offering, which grew 60 per cent in the last quarter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Threats</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A&nbsp;failure to&nbsp;tackle music and entertainment issues&nbsp;might sink its voice assistant&nbsp;smart speakers. Amazon Echo devices could be challenged by Apple's HomePod, due to launch next week. Plus, an ongoing feud with Google may throw a spanner in the works.&nbsp;The rowsaw&nbsp; Google remove&nbsp;YouTube from Amazon's Echo and Fire streaming devices . Without popular streaming apps, the smart speakers could fall out of favour .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   Google                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Strengths</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Google, now a subsidiary of&nbsp;parent company Alphabet,&nbsp;is one of the most recognised brands in the world. Its primary business as the information sorter of choice and miner of the world's data to be converted into ad revenue is likely to continue for&nbsp;the foreseeable future, and it has the cash to absorb rival technologies that threaten it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Weaknesses</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Google has seen its traffic acquisition costs rising over the past 12 months, which could spell trouble for 2018.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These costs are payments sent to other companies to direct consumer and business traffic to its website. Consumers are increasingly searching across a mix of mobile, desktop and tablets, bumping up costs, so much so that rising advertising revenues toward the end of 2017 were not enough to offset them. In light of this Google&nbsp;announced surprisingly disappointing earnings on Thursday evening,&nbsp;sparking a share price drop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Alphabet is heavily, heavily reliant on Google advertising revenue and there is creeping competition in the advertising business (Facebook for some time, and Amazon also creeping in),&quot; says Forrester analyst Colin Colburn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So that will be an interesting story to see how it plays out over the coming quarters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   The best smartspeakers, from Amazon Echo to Google Home                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opportunities</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Google has expanded into cloud storage and consumer electronics to rival Apple. Its flagship smartphone, the Google Pixel 2, was widely regarded as one of the best phones on the market upon its launch in October last year, and a worthy opponent to the iPhone X.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Its purchase of smartphone manufacturer HTC suggests big plans for its hardware division. In its latest earnings report, Google said hardware sales doubled on the same period last year. Though we have been here before: it bought Motorola for&nbsp;$12.5bn in 2012 and sold it for $2.9bn two years later, having extracted the patents it wanted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Threats</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Extremism, hate speech and cyber bullying have put Google in the spotlight. These have transformed its perception from a Californian start-up done good to a negligent platform that puts users in harm's way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite promising sales of its smart speaker after its launch in the end of 2017, which was boosted by heavy discounts, it might struggle to contend&nbsp;with Amazon's Echo and the new HomePod .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Data, once widely regarded as &quot;the new oil&quot; might cause Google to come unstuck. Incoming General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) may see a clamping down on how information Google retrieves through its search engine, Android operating system and smart speaker can be used. If Google falls foul of GDPR it faces a&nbsp;maximum penalty of 4pc of global annual turnover or (EURO)20m (&pound;17.6m), depending on which is greater.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile&nbsp;increasing pressure from regulators and the European Union could suck up more cash, with Google forced to pay up billions of dollars in antitrust fines .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   Apple                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Strengths</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apple is the world's biggest company, overtaking South Korean electronics giant Samsung to become the largest seller of smartphones. On Thursday evening, it posted the largest quarterly profit of all time, despite a fall in iPhone sales. A company that sells less, but earns more, signals greater things to come. Sales for Apple Watch and Apple TV have also improved.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Weaknesses&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Depending on how you interpret the results, selling fewer of the expensive  iPhone X is either genius or a red flag. Generally, appetite for smartphones appears to be falling slightly, which means Apple may no longer be able to count on huge sales every year it brings out a new version.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sales of Apple Mac computers have also fallen as people spend less.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   Worldwide iPhone sales                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opportunities</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Apple's hotly anticipated HomePod will launch next week, with the company taking a big step into the market for smart speakers.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apple has also suffered bad press&nbsp;in the last year. It apologised after it emerged that it was slowing down iPhones with older batteries, a suspicion long held by customers who were convinced they were being nudged to buy newer models.&nbsp;Apple said that it slowed older batteries to stop phones from shutting down&nbsp;by throttling them in a software update last year. It is now offering discounts on its battery replacement service.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Extraordinary growth and bigger profit than we've seen before means Apple is definitely on track to be a trillion,&quot; says&nbsp;Sucharita Kodali, analyst at Forrester.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New laws set to come into force in April will mean that popular porn sites like PornHub and RedTube will require users to sign up with their names and addresses before letting them watch videos.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rules are a result of the Digital Economy Act 2018 and will store names, phone numbers, addresses and dates under a new system called AgeID.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Which basically mean if you want to access a porn site, you'll need to create a username and password first.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     CamSoda launches the 'ultimate adult experience' where users mimic sex with models through a combination of VR and sex dolls                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The laws have targeted pron giant Mindgeek, which operates the following sites - all of which will now require your name and address:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unsurprisingly, some other porn providers aren't too happy about it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You can imagine how much data that is going to give MindGeek, if they're going to have stats on what people click on, what porn sites people click on, what they pay for,&quot; said porn site owner Pandora Blake at an Open Rights Group meeting in London last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Once you've got a MindGeek login, you're going to be giving them your entire web browsing history, because they're going to be able to track every time you log in to anything.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Will the new restrictions stop you watching porn?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Privacy campaigners are naturally concerned about what might happen in the event of a security breach. Last month, VR porn site SinVR was hacked and the details of 20,000 users was stolen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mindgeek says that the new AgeID platform has been built from the ground up to protect user's privacy and be fully compliant with GDPR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We do not store any personal data entered during the age-verification process,&quot; a spokesperson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Due to the encrypted nature of AgeID's login credentials, such data cannot be exposed in the unlikely event of a hack.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These new age verification rules will be policed by the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) which also polices the age ratings that are given to mainstream films.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">By James Titcomb</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">TECHNOLOGY; Version:1</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">727 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In May 2016 - less than two years ago -&nbsp;Facebook boasted that people spend an average of 50 minutes a day on its apps - Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The figure was seen as a sign of the internet behemoth's astonishing success, as well as its growing influence over our lives. But two years is a long time, especially in social media land.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Wednesday night, Facebook's founder Mark Zuckerberg said users are spending&nbsp;in total&nbsp;50 million hours less a day on Facebook. That works&nbsp;out at a 5pc reduction in time, or two minutes per person .</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook framed the decline as a good thing: a result of recently-made changes to the news feed that decrease the number of viral videos users see, and encourage sharing with friends and family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The most important driver of our business has never been time spent by itself,&quot; Zuckerberg said . &quot;Time in news feed interacting with people is more valuable than time passively consuming video or news.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the decline in usage also appeared to reflect something else - the creeping sense that users might be retreating from the world's biggest social network. The company has been under significant&nbsp;pressure to reform amid allegations of fake news and that it is damaging users' well-being.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   Time spent on the decline                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook pointed to the declining amount of time spent as a a deliberate, and good, thing: a result of the recent news feed changes that relegated viral videos and news publishers. However, he declined to say how he was so confident it was a result of the changes, and not for some other reason.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Mark May, an analyst at Citi, asked the company whether there might be factors outside of Facebook's control, Zuckerberg dodged the question, merely asserting that he was focused on people having a &quot;good time&quot; on the site.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook's boss said he expected the amount of time spent on the app may continue to decrease, adding: &quot;we think it'll be good for the business over the long term&quot;. But should this carry on, less time spent on Facebook could well become&nbsp;a problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Analysts at Baird say some users are suffering &quot;Facebook fatigue&quot;. A recent survey&nbsp;found that around 50pc&nbsp;of members are using the social network less, just over 30pc the same amount&nbsp;and just over 10pc more often.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   Slowing daily user growth                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beyond the reduction in time spent, there were other potentially ominous signs. One of the biggest that analysts picked up on was that the number of people to log into Facebook on a daily basis is growing at a slower rate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Daily usage is an important figure because it's a sign of engagement: those that log in every day are the most valuable users.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What initially worried investors was that the number of daily users in North America - the most profitable and mature region&nbsp;-&nbsp;declined for the first time on record, falling by around 700,000. Facebook said it did not expect this to become a trend, although we will have to wait until the next set of results to see if it is.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook's Sheryl Sandberg added&nbsp;that upcoming European data rules, known as the GDPR, could affect the number of daily users in Europe. The GDPR will require users to give more explicit consent about their data being processed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Users have also noticed a rise in Facebook alerts asking users to come back. If somebody hasn't checked the app in a while, they might get a barely-relevant push alert, an apparent wheeze to pull them back in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook notifications 3 years ago: Jamie liked your photo.Facebook notifications now: A person you once had a 6 minute conversation with at a mutual friend's bday is interested in going to an event you could care less about.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Max Miller (@RuinMyWeek) January 28, 2018                                                                                  Fake accounts rise                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was more concern over Facebook's numbers as it once again upgraded the number of accounts it believes to be fake. Three months ago, it said between 2-3pc of users are likely to be fake; on Thursday night it upgraded that to between 3-4pc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a small upgrade but it means that as many as 85m users on Facebook are fake. Another 10pc - some 210m - may be duplicate accounts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The accuracy of Facebook's user numbers have been questioned before, such as claiming it has a third more users in the US than actually exist .</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mindgeek, which owns sites Pornhub, Redtube, YouPorn and Brazzers, is preparing to role out AgeID when the&nbsp;Digital Economy Act 2018 is implemented.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the system has alarmed privacy campaigners who claims it could lead to an Ashley Madison-style leak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Porn Site owner Pandora Blake said last year: 'You can imagine how much data that is going to give MindGeek, if they're going to have stats on what people click on, what porn sites people click on, what they pay for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Once you've got a MindGeek login, you're going to be giving them your entire web browsing history, because they're going to be able to track every time you log in to anything.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In August 2015 millions of cheating spouses using the Ashley Madison infidelity website were outed after hackers leaked their personal details and sex fantasies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Names, ages, addresses, phone numbers and credit card details of up to 37million users - including 1.2million in the UK - were laid bare in a 9.7 gigabyte file called 'Time's Up!' posted on the dark web.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bankers, civil servants, UN peacekeepers and even Vatican employees were outed by hackers from the Impact Team because they are considered 'cheating dirtbags'.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jim Killock Executive Director of the privacy group Open Rights Group added, 'The BBFC will struggle to ensure that Age Verification is safe, secure and anonymous. They are powerless to ensure people's privacy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'The major publisher, MindGeek, looks like it will dominate the AV market. We are very worried about their product, AgeID, which could track people's porn use.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'The way this product develops is completely out of BBFC's hands. 'Users will not be able to choose how to access websites.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'They'll be at the mercy of porn companies. And the blame lies squarely with Theresa May's government for pushing incomplete legislation.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a MindGeek spokesman said the 'principles of privacy by designed' are at the core of the AgeID system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The spokesnan added: 'AgeID has been built from the ground up with data protection, data minimisation and the principles of privacy by design at its core, while also complying with the GDPR.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'This is why we where do not store any personal data entered during the age-verification process.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Due to the encrypted nature of AgeID's login credentials, such data cannot be exposed in the unlikely event of a hack.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, critics argue the new law could lead to a large number of sites being blocked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Online ID checks will require viewers prove they are 18 before viewing any porn online, as part of the Digital Economy Act 2018.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The system will be overseen by the British Board of Film Censorship but porn publishers will carry out their own age checks.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Users will need to make their AgeID account using a passport or mobile phone to confirm their age.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The information will then be passed to a government-approved service to confirm the user is over 18.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Porn sites which fail to ID users could be fined up to &pound;250,000.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Government will also be able to ask payment service to withdraw their support.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FACEBOOK is announcing a transparency drive to update its privacy controls, following scrutiny in Europe over how it handles user information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It will for the first time publish a set of privacy principles, offer users a &quot;privacy check-up&quot; and create a new data control portal, in response to incoming European data privacy laws.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We believe that we have to comply with the General Data Protection Regulation and we want to make sure that privacy works for people who use Facebook,&quot; Emily Sharpe, the privacy and public policy manager, told The Daily Telegraph. &quot;To do that, we need to build it into the design of the product.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Sharpe said the campaign would give Facebook's 2bn users a greater understanding of how what they share is used to sell adverts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Its data collection tools are currently under threat in Germany, where Facebook is being investigated on how it uses third party data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook sells companies the opportunity to target customers who are grouped into certain profiles, based on how they act not only on Facebook, but on other internet sites. The Silicon Valley giant is currently able to track a person across the web and can detect, for example, if someone has been viewing travel websites.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That could place a user into the travel profile, which holiday companies will pay for the chance to target with marketing that pops up on the news feed. Facebook allows a user to remove themselves from these categories, but it is turned on by default. Despite the new privacy initiative, there appears to be no move to show users exactly what third party information is associated with their account. Ms Sharpe said: &quot;We are clear with people about the data we collect from third parties and other sources and we are transparent about how that data is used.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Transparency about the data we collect is paramount to our relationship with people who use Facebook, and we are actually already very transparent about it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She is working with law makers to ensure Facebook is compliant with the GDPR before the May 25 cut-off.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a new data protection law that will enter into force on May 25, 2018.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It aims to&nbsp;strengthen and unify data protection for all individuals within the European Union (EU).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This means cracking down on how companies like Google and Facebook use and sell the data they collect on their users.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The law will mark the biggest overhaul of personal data privacy rules since the birth of the internet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under GDPR, companies will be required to report data breaches within 72 hours, as well as to allow customers to export their data and delete it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Part of the expanded rights of data subjects outlined by the GDPR is the right for data subjects to obtain from the data controller confirmation as to whether or not personal data concerning them is being processed, where and for what purpose.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Further, the controller must provide a copy of the personal data, free of charge, in an electronic format. This change is a dramatic shift to data transparency and empowerment of data subjects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the right to be forgotten, also known as Data Erasure, are entitled to have the data controller erase their personal data, cease further dissemination of the data, and potentially have third parties halt processing of the data.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conditions for erasure include the data no longer being relevant to original purposes for processing, or a data subject withdrawing their consent.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This right requires controllers to compare the subjects' rights to 'the public interest in the availability of the data' when considering such requests.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Facebook is teaching you how to keep your data private with a set of new educational videos.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The social media giant has also published its privacy principles for the first time as it prepares for a tough new EU data protection law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The videos show users how to manage the data that Facebook uses to show them ads, how to delete old posts, and what happens to their information when they delete their account.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The platform targets ads based on 98 personal data points its collects on members using their on-site activity, location settings and internet connection.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anything from your marital status, age, places you've checked in, the pages you have liked, and more can be seen by advertisers unless you have changed your Facebook privacy settings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scroll down for video&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As well as its new education clips, which will appear in people's News Feeds starting today, Facebook is&nbsp;sharing privacy tips in advertising campaigns on other websites,&nbsp;Erin Egan, chief privacy officer at the firm, said in a&nbsp; blog post.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the post, Facebook, which has more than 2 billion users worldwide, also revealed its privacy principles, which&nbsp;outline how the company handles users' information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook said it had never before published the principles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Monday's announcements are a sign of its efforts to get ready before the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) enters into force on May 25.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The law will mark the biggest overhaul of personal data privacy rules since the birth of the internet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under GDPR, companies will be required to report data breaches within 72 hours, as well as to allow customers to export their data and delete it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook's privacy principles, which are separate from the user terms and conditions that are agreed when someone opens an account, range from giving users control of their privacy, to building privacy features into Facebook products from the outset, to users owning the information they share.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We recognize that people use Facebook to connect, but not everyone wants to share everything with everyone - including with us,' Mr Egan wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'It's important that you have choices when it comes to how your data is used.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also among the company's privacy principles are helping users understand how their data is used, keeping that information secure, constantly improving new controls, and being accountable to regulators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We put products through rigorous data security testing,' the blog post said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We also meet with regulators, legislators and privacy experts around the world to get input on our data practices and policies.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook uses a range of personal data points to target advertisements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not all of the ads you see while scrolling have been placed there using Facebook's 'mind reading' tools, as the technology looks for obvious clues on your page such as whether you're getting married, planning a vacation or about to have a birthday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of the ads are from personal information that users give away themselves through posts, comments and profile updates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook has previously said: 'We use information from a few different sources to figure out which ads might be relevant and useful to you.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Things like your Facebook profile information, activity on Facebook and interactions with businesses can all influence the ads you see.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company's Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg announced last week that Facebook would be creating a new privacy centre which would put the social network's key privacy settings in one place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GDPR drastically increases the level of fines for companies found to be in breach of data protection law, potentially rising as high as four percent of global annual turnover or 20 million euros, whichever is higher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook has faced probes from EU regulators over its use of user data and tracking of online activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As of Monday, users will be reminded by their News Feeds to take a 'privacy checkup,' Mr Egan wrote in his blog.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reminders aim to ensure users are comfortable about what data they are sharing, and with whom.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">TECHNOLOGY; Version:2</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">468 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook is announcing a transparency drive to update its privacy controls, following scrutiny in Europe over how it handles user information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It will for the first time publish a set of privacy principles, offer users a &quot;privacy check-up&quot; and create a new data control portal, in response to incoming European data privacy laws.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We believe that we have to comply with the General Data Protection Regulation and we want to make sure that privacy works for people who use Facebook,&quot; Emily Sharpe, the privacy and public policy manager, told The Daily Telegraph. &quot;To do that, we need to build it into the design of the product.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Sharpe said the campaign would give Facebook's 2bn users a greater understanding of how what they share is used to sell adverts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Its data collection tools are currently under threat in Germany, where Facebook is being investigated on how it uses third party data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook sells companies the opportunity to target customers who are grouped into certain profiles, based on how they act not only on Facebook, but on other internet sites. The Silicon Valley giant is currently able to track a person across the web and can detect, for example, if someone has been viewing travel websites.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That could place a user into the travel profile, which holiday companies will pay for the chance to target with marketing that pops up on the news feed. Facebook allows a user to remove themselves from these categories, but it is turned on by default.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the new privacy initiative, there appears to be no move to show users exactly what third party information is associated with their account. Ms Sharpe said: &quot;We are clear with people about the data we collect from third parties and other sources and we are transparent about how that data is used.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   Facebook by numbers                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Transparency about the data we collect is paramount to our relationship with people who use Facebook, and we are actually already very transparent about it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She is working with law makers to ensure Facebook is compliant with the GDPR before the May 25 cut-off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If found in breach of the law, which will look at how and why companies collect and retain data, Facebook faces a maximum fine of $1.1bn (&pound;777m). Writing in a blog post last Monday, Erin Egan, Facebook's chief privacy officer, said that the company had worked with experts in data protection and privacy law to improve the design of the website and smartphone apps.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For most people, January is a depressing month of diets, darkness and demotivation, but not for some of the UK's small businesses, who took to social media this month to share their optimism about jobs, investment and available support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's what The Daily Telegraph Business Tracker found when it analysed the Twitter posts of 25,000 British firms and businesspeople between Jan 1 and Jan 22. Compiled by insight company, Impact Social, the tracker revealed that small businesses have more to be happy than worried about this month, with 20pc of the 8,000 tweets shared between those dates containing a positive sentiment.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just 14pc of tweets were negative and 66pc were neutral (messages without any sentiment attached, such as January sales promotions).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of the positive tweets, a quarter (26pc) contained excitement about new roles to fill, with many companies posting job vacancy ads via the social media website. Another quarter (26pc) praised the country's start-up-friendly environment, referencing the free courses that are available to businesses that need help on issues that worry many at the beginning of a new year: taxation, access to funding and, specific to 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which comes into force on May 25 and will impact how companies collect and manage customer data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Small businesses were also keen to encourage each other under the &quot;new year, new you&quot; mantra, with one in 10 positive posts containing motivational language alongside links to articles about successful entrepreneurs with inspiring stories to tell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, 10pc of approving tweets were from firms that had secured new investment - successful crowdfunding campaigns, for example.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the tracker, tweets of a gloomy sentiment used language of fear and doubt. Nearly half (44pc), for instance, spoke about Brexit uncertainty, with the majority of these tweets referencing concerns about the future of UK-EU trade. But it's worth noting that 9pc of positive tweets mentioned Brexit opportunities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, 12pc spoke angrily about the recent collapse of Carillion, with jobs and livelihoods on the line at thousands of small subcontractors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And 15pc of pessimistic posts mentioned a concern for either inflation or negative wage growth, but, as Will Brown of Impact Social explains: &quot;There wasn't evidence in the data of any real impact of these on UK small business during this period; it's more of a perpetual fear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The onward march of artificial intelligence and automation [8pc of negative tweets] is similar - there's a fear of the unknown.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Businesses, he says, need clear guidance and help from government in these areas: &quot;Fear is not a healthy trait; it only fuels hesitation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One in 10 small firms that tweeted negatively about their start to the year mentioned late payments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mike Cherry, national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB), wants 2018 to be the year that government makes progress in tackling this poor payment practice: &quot;Following Carillion's collapse, it's unsurprising that the issue of late payments is on the minds of small business owners. It continues to be a big issue for small firms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our own research shows that, on average, 30pc of payments are typically late, while the average value of each late payment stands at &pound;6,142.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This must change; small businesses deserve to be paid promptly,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is the Daily Telegraph Business Tracker?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Daily Telegraph Business Tracker is a piece of analysis compiled by Impact Social.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It tracks the Twitter posts of 25,000 British companies and businesspeople, searching their public tweets for indicators of their sentiment towards the state of the economy, their own business performance, and their reaction to government policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Between Jan 1 and 22, they had tweeted a total of 8,000 times. Those aggregated search results are then analysed manually by Impact Social's researchers to assess whether the messages are positive, negative or neutral.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That process also strips out posts that are promotional, leaving only the businesses' actual opinions on the topics in question.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether you regard the digitalisation of society as a welcome revolution or a bewildering disruption, the argument that new rules are needed to protect citizens' data is largely undisputed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevertheless, preparing for the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) - a new EU directive due to come into force in May - poses significant challenges for public sector organisations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For those working in and with services for children, the GDPR introduces an unprecedented layer of complexity, from differing ages of consent across the EU, to competing and repetitive requirements for data from different agencies and providing simple, child-friendly explanations that also inform consent for data sharing. All these issues could cause significant headaches. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a little extra effort and focus now could help avoid challenges in the future; organisations could be ordered to pay huge fines - &pound;18m or 4% of turnover, whichever is higher - if they do not at least show how they plan to comply. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Organisations could be ordered to pay huge fines if they do not at least show how they plan to comply</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Children's social care services hold a significant amount of personal data about the families and children they are involved with. This ranges from basic demographics to in-depth qualitative data, and sometimes stretches over decades. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Currently, local authorities have to share data with colleagues working in other public services, such as health and the police, if it is needed for child protection purposes. How that is done and what needs to happen before it takes place is likely to change under the GDPR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ahead of the new regulation coming into force, child-focused app developer Mind of My Own, digital development company Neontribe and public sector digital design experts FutureGov came together to discuss these issues with those on the frontline of children's services and discover how to prepare. Here, we share the key pointers for children's services, partners and suppliers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  What does it take to make digital technology work in children's services?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   It's about consent                    </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For under-16s, parental consent is required to approve a child's permission to use their personal data. This can be complicated for children in contact with social care services because of concerns about their welfare, and whose best interests may not always be served by the parent with consent rights. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fortunately, the hierarchy of laws whereby child protection trumps privacy rights is likely to hold, but workers will have to show how they decided additional consent could be waived. Where practitioners work face-to-face with young people, this could be done easily through training and raising awareness. It becomes more complicated when obtaining informed consent from young people to use digital services that may use their data in multiple ways. In their direct work with young people, practitioners will be well-placed to help them understand what is involved in agreeing to privacy statements and terms and conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   Sharing information                    </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Children's services are routinely asked to share personal data with other local public bodies as part of a multi-agency approach. Children's services teams need to be ready to explain to children and those with parental responsibility about who may access their data and why. Under the GDPR, the organisation collecting the data is responsible for explaining this clearly and in detail. Gaining informed consent early on will save time and effort. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Best practice has always been for workers who collect and may share personal information about children and young people to explain clearly to them and their parents or carers how that data is likely to be used. A good rule of thumb is to remember that the Data Protection Act 1998 and the GDPR are about protecting the privacy of individuals rather than organisations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  GDPR: how charities should prepare for data protection changes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   Know why                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the GDPR, all personal data held or processed must have been collected for a specific legal reason, which informs the organisation how it can be used. When a &quot;data subject&quot; gives explicit consent, this is normally sufficient legal basis for processing their data. Other reasons include compliance with employment laws; protecting the vital interests of a data subject who cannot give consent; not-for-profit organisations that do not disclose to third parties; and certain legal processes, such as care proceedings. In cases where teachers, social workers or health professionals have strong evidence of a safeguarding issue, relevant legislation such as the Children Act 1989 takes precedence and personal information may be shared if it is clearly in the child's best interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   Prepare, but don't panic                    </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GDPR takes the place of the Data Protection Act in the hierarchy of laws about working with children. It broadens the definitions of personal data from those in the act and specifies that consent must be unambiguous, explicit and recorded. There is no real change here, but services are mindful not to repeat the &quot;cookies experience&quot;, where people using websites and apps tend to consent to the collection and processing of personal data without fully understanding the terms and conditions. The GDPR is designed to try to ensure this trap is avoided by requiring organisations to spell things out in language that everyone, including children, can understand. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Any big change can feel onerous, especially during uncertain times. However, if done correctly, the shift required under the GDPR should make data protection easier for everyone to manage and understand - service users and professionals alike.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook will roll out a new set of tools aimed at making it easier for users to make informed choices about their privacy in response to sweeping new European privacy laws, according to the company's chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're rolling out a new privacy centre globally that will put the core privacy settings for Facebook in one place and make it much easier for people to manage their data,&quot; Sandberg said at a Facebook event in Brussels on Tuesday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said that the creation of a &quot;privacy centre&quot; was prompted by the requirements of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), an EU regulation that seeks to give Europeans more control over their information and how companies use it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our apps have long been focused on giving people transparency and control and this gives us a very good foundation to meet all the requirements of the GDPR and to spur us on to continue investing in products and in educational tools to protect privacy,&quot; Sandberg said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Companies found to be in breach of GDPR face a maximum penalty of 4% of global annual turnover or (EURO)20m (&pound;17.77m), whichever is greater. In Facebook's case, based on a total revenue of $27.6bn in 2016, the maximum possible fine would be $1.1bn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sandberg also said that the Facebook would work hard to end the abuse of its platform by those seeking to hurt the democratic process around the world, and tackle the problem of fake news. She reiterated the company's promise to double the number of people working on safety and security to 20,000 by the end of the year. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If we can prevent people from being part of our ad networks, prevent people from advertising and take away the financial incentive, that is one of the strongest things we can do against false news, and we are very focused on this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday, the company published a series of blogposts accepting that it had been too slow to recognise the damage it was inflicting on democracies around the world. &quot;I wish I could guarantee that the positives [of social media] are destined to outweigh the negatives, but I can't,&quot; said Facebook product manager Samidh Chakrabarti.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An hereditary peer who voted to muzzle the press previously came under fire for his expenses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Viscount Falkland was accused of exploiting a loophole to pocket &pound;125,000 by claiming a home in Kent as his main residence - despite actually spending most of his time in London.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week the peer was among those who voted for an inquiry into the Press, and backed moves to force most publications to pay costs in data protection cases even if they win.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The result caused fury, with ministers saying it would restrict press freedoms and deal a 'hammer blow' to local papers. The government has vowed to overturn the amendments in the Commons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2009 it emerged that the 15th Viscount of Falkland registered a two-bedroom oast house in Kent, owned by his wife's aunt, as his main home, despite not being on the electoral roll there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In reality, he was living in a three-storey Victorian townhouse in fashionable Clapham, South London, just three miles from the House of Lords.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By saying his primary residence was near Maidstone, 50 miles from Westminster, he became entitled to subsistence payments of &pound;174 a night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the rules at the time members of the Lords whose main residence was within Greater London could night claim night subsistence allowance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The peer, whose family name is Lucius Edward William Plantagenet Cary, was making claims for at least a decade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He defended his actions in 2009, saying he was just 'an impoverished peer', and the House of Lords later cleared him of breaching rules.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told the Sun on Sunday today: 'You can understand my attitude against the press isn't very friendly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another peer criticised over expenses claims, Baroness Uddin, was among the supporters of the anti-press amendments last week.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following a lengthy and impassioned debate, peers voted by 238 votes to 209, majority 29, for a further hearing into alleged data protection breaches by the media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Supporters of the move argued it was needed amid claims of ongoing press abuses while opponents said it amounted to &quot;harassment&quot; of the media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The upper chamber also backed a controversial measure which would see newspapers not signed up to a state-supported regulator pay their own and their opponent's legal costs in relation to alleged data protection breaches, even if they were successful in court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was despite warnings the move was unlawful and was effectively &quot;blackmail&quot; of the media.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soon after the votes, Culture Secretary Matt Hancock tweeted: &quot;House of Lords have just voted to restrict press freedoms. This vote will undermine high quality journalism, fail to resolve challenges the media face and is a hammer blow to local press. We support a free press and will seek to overturn these amendments in the Commons.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The challenges came during the report stage in the Lords of the Data Protection Bill, which will bring the European Union's general data protection regulation (GDPR) into domestic law, helping Britain prepare for Brexit because it will mean the systems are aligned when the UK leaves the bloc.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carphone Warehouse has been slapped with a &pound;400,000 fine after one of the company's computer systems was compromised as a result of a cyber-attack in 2015, putting millions of people's data at risk. The Information Commissioner's Office on Wednesday said that the company's failure to secure the system allowed unauthorised access to the personal data of over three million customers and 1,000 employees.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That data included names, addresses, phone numbers, dates of birth, marital statuses and - for more than 18,000 customers - historical payment card details. &quot;A company as large, well-resourced, and established as Carphone Warehouse, should have been actively assessing its data security systems, and ensuring systems were robust and not vulnerable to such attacks,&quot; said Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Carphone Warehouse should be at the top of its game when it comes to cyber-security, and it is concerning that the systemic failures we found related to rudimentary, commonplace measures.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ICO said that intruders had theoretically been able to access Carphone Warehouse's system via out-of-date WordPress software, but it also said that so far there has been no evidence that the inadequate security measures had actually resulted in cases of identity theft or fraud.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nonetheless, Ms Denham said that customers and employees had been victimised by having their data &quot;open to abuse by the malicious actions of the intruder&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Companies and public bodies need to take serious steps to protect systems, and most importantly, customers and employees,&quot; she said. May this year will see the introduction of a set of stringent data protection rules known as the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many have described GDPR as the most significant development in UK data protection law since the 1990s. Under it, companies will have to be more transparent in the way that they collect data, be more explicit about notifying the public if there's a hack or a data breach, and will have to appoint a dedicated data protection officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The regulation covers all companies that handle any form of data belonging to EU citizens, and institutions which fail to comply will face a fine that may be tied to revenue.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The upper chamber voted by 238 votes to 209, defeating the Government with a majority of 29. Itcalls on the Government to investigate &quot;corporate governance and management failures&quot; in the press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The crossbench amendment to the Data Protection Bill - supported by Labour and the Liberal Democrats - aims to hold a second phase of the Levesoninquiry, following the first that was set up by David Cameron in 2011.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Supporters of the move argued it was needed amid claims of ongoing press abuses while opponents said it amounted to &quot;harassment&quot; of the media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the vote could be overturned when the legislation returns to the Commons, the newly-appointed Culture Secretary Matt Hancock said: &quot;House of Lords have just voted to restrict press freedoms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This vote will undermine high quality journalism, fail to resolve challenges the media face and is a hammer blow to local press. We support a free press and will seek to overturn these amendments in the Commons.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leveson 'Part Two' may never go ahead</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following the vote Tom McNally, a Liberal Democrat peer, said the Conservatives &quot;have been halted in their shameless disregard for the private lives of those violated by the press going too far&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added: &quot;This victory will send a message to those whose privacy was trampled on by press hacking and other criminality that we are serious about protecting their rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Tories have clamoured about attacks on press freedoms but this is just a bogus smokescreen to try and shield press barons from independent oversight. This is a step in the right direction towards protecting freedoms and privacy&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chamber also backed by 211 votes to 200, majority 11, a controversial measure which would see newspapers not signed up to a state-supported regulator pay their own and their opponent's legal costs in relation to alleged data protection breaches, even if they were successful in court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was despite warnings the move was unlawful and was effectively &quot;blackmail&quot; of the media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The successful challenges came during the report stage of the Data Protection Bill, which will bring the European Union's general data protection regulation (GDPR) into domestic law, helping Britain prepare for Brexit because it will mean the systems are aligned when the UK leaves the bloc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also aims to make it simpler for people to control how companies use their personal details, with extra powers for the information watchdog to issue much larger fines.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Information Commissioner's Office on Wednesday said that the company's failure to secure the system allowed unauthorised access to the personal data of over three million customers and 1,000 employees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That data included names, addresses, phone numbers, dates of birth, marital statuses and - for more than 18,000 customers -historical payment card details.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Information Commissioner has 'huge concerns' over Uber data breach</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A company as large, well-resourced, and established as Carphone Warehouse, should have been actively assessing its data security systems, and ensuring systems were robust and not vulnerable to such attacks,&quot; said Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Carphone Warehouse should be at the top of its game when it comes to cyber-security, and it is concerning that the systemic failures we found related to rudimentary, commonplace measures.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ICO said that intruders had theoretically been able to access Carphone Warehouse's system via out-of-date WordPress software, but it also said that so far there has been no evidence that the inadequate security measures had actually resulted in cases of identity theft or fraud. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nonetheless, Ms Denham said that customers and employees had been victimised by having their data &quot;open to abuse by the malicious actions of the intruder&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Companies and public bodies need to take serious steps to protect systems, and most importantly, customers and employees,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">May this year will see the introduction of a set of stringent data protection rules known as the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many have described GDPR as the most significant development in UK data protection law since the 1990s. Under it, companies will have to be more transparent in the way that they collect data, be more explicit about notifying the public if there's a hack or a data breach, and will have to appoint a dedicated data protection officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The regulation covers all companies that handle any form of data belonging to EU citizens, and institutions which fail to comply will face a fine that may be tied to revenue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To face a &pound;400,000 fine for exposing customers' personal details to hackers once might be considered misfortune. But for Sir Charles Dunstone, who was today hit with his second record penalty from data protection watchdogs, it is beginning to look like carelessness.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carphone Warehouse was handed the fine after a cyber attack exposed the personal details of more than 3m of its customers and staff in 2015, when Sir Charles was its chairman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is just the second company to receive a fine that large from the Information Commissioner's Office, the other culprit being TalkTalk, which was spun out of Carphone Warehouse in 2010, and whose board is also helmed by the billionaire entrepreneur.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ICO said Carphone Warehouse's failure to secure its systems allowed hackers to gain access to names, addresses, phone numbers, dates of birth, marital status and, for more than 18,000 customers, historical payment card details. &nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elizabeth Denham, the Information Commissioner, said: &quot;Carphone Warehouse should be at the top of its game when it comes to cyber-security, and it is concerning that the systemic failures we found related to rudimentary, commonplace measures.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ICO said it found &quot;multiple inadequacies&quot; in Carphone Warehouse's data security practices and that the company had &quot;failed to take adequate steps&quot; to protect customer information, neglecting to update important software and not carrying out routine security checks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carphone Warehouse will only have to pay &pound;320,000 of the fine, as there is a 20pc discount for early payment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Companies that break data protection rules currently face a fine of up to &pound;500,000. That will rise to (EURO)20m (&pound;17.8m) or 4pc of global annual revenues, whichever is higher, once the new Europe-wide General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) come into force later this year. &nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokesman for the company said it was sorry for any distress caused by the incident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We accept today's decision by the ICO and have co-operated fully throughout its investigation into the illegal cyberattack on a specific system within one of Carphone Warehouse's UK divisions in 2015,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As the ICO notes in its report, we moved quickly at the time to secure our systems, to put in place additional security measures and to inform the ICO and potentially affected customers and colleagues.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shares in Dixons Carphone, the company created by Carphone Warehouse's merger with Dixons Retail in 2014, were down 0.8pc at 202p in afternoon trade.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BEING able to attract and retain key staff is the No1 concern of businesses this year, according to a report by Dublin Chamber.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The survey, carried out amongst 210 companies, found more than two thirds of firms (69%) rank the retention and attraction of employees as an issue of high concern.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Concerns about new GDPR data protection legislation - due to come into effect in May - provide the second biggest headache for firms. Around 62% stated they are highly concerned by how the new regulations will impact on their business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nearly one-in-four firms (23%) said they felt their business is unprepared for GDPR. More encouragingly, 60% said they feel &quot;quite prepared&quot; for GDPR, while 11% believed they were &quot;very prepared&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Traffic is expected to remain a big issue for firms in the year ahead. Around 53% of firms said they were highly concerned about the impact of increasing congestion on their firm in 2018.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dublin Chamber chief Mary Rose Burke said: &quot;Irish businesses are in a relatively good place going in to 2018.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;However, this survey shows that there are a number of significant challenges that companies will need to overcome over the next 12 months. &quot;It's no surprise that fears over retaining and attracting good staff are top of mind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;With the country edging ever closer to full employment, competition for talent continues to heat up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We see this both at a national and international level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have some of the world's best staff working in Dublin, but keeping them here - and attracting more like them - has never been tougher.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unsurprisingly, Brexit continues to occupy the minds of Irish business owners and managers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Around half of respondents (49%) pinpointed it as an issue they were highly concerned about over the coming 12 months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Encouragingly for the Government, businesses are positive about how it has handled Brexit negotiations so far. Three-quarters of firms rated the its performance in Brexit discussions as either &quot;good&quot; or &quot;very good&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Around 20% described the Government's performance as average, with just 4% summing it up as &quot;poor&quot; or &quot;very poor&quot;. However, businesses are more critical of the Government's performance in solving Dublin's infrastructure issues. 85% said the Government was not doing enough to ease infrastructure pressures facing Dublin, Ms Burke said: &quot;Dublin is competing on a daily basis with other cities around the world and it is vital therefore that we ensure that Dublin is as attractive and as competitive as possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This includes ensuring that Ireland's tax base is attractive and compares favourably with other cities, notably the UK cities. Measures must also be taken to continually improve the quality of life that's on offer in Dublin.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c6">A seismic year awaits and that's even before Brexit; <BR>The financial services industry faces major upheaval as a number of policy changes will open up the sector to greater competition</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Omar Ali</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">BUSINESS; Pg. 2</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This will be yet another seismic year for the financial services industry, and not just because of Brexit. Of course, the UK's decision to leave the EU will continue to attract considerable attention for the sector, given the importance of the EU to the City and vice versa. Securing a binding transition phase early in 2018, alongside a successful outcome for the future trading relationship, will be critical, but Brexit isn't the only force at play.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year will see the culmination of a number of regulatory interventions and policy changes, which will make the sector more resilient and more open to competition. The fabric of UK financial services could experience as big a change as we went through after the global financial crisis.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While predictions are fraught with danger; there are three trends that are likely to accelerate in 2018: Firstly: increasing choice for consumers - initiatives such as open banking, which will launch in 2018, will provide new entrants with further opportunities to grow. This increased competition will compel the major institutions to speed up the pace of change in their own businesses and drive further improvements to their products and services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Secondly: more financial services jobs outside of London - the ring fencing of banks, a key regulatory intervention to make the system safer and more resilient, will go live. This will see many geographical changes, including HSBC's ring-fenced bank launching in Birmingham. Combined with the need for the industry to be more efficient, it will help drive growth of UK financial services in areas outside of London.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thirdly: UK fintech goes mainstream - spurred by larger companies collaborating with new innovators, exciting new apps and a supportive regulatory environment for new players, we expect to see consumers become increasingly aware of, and familiar with, using UK fintech products and services. We will continue to see rapid development of crypto-currencies and the use of artificial intelligence (AI); intensifying the debate on how we regulate these new areas, and protect against evolving cyber risks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We will see the introduction of a wave of new regulation that will enable change and drive increased competition. The simultaneous arrival of the general data protection regulation (GDPR), ring fencing, the payment services directive 2 (PSD2) and the UK's enforcement of open banking is potentially revolutionary. The focus on data-sharing, opening up the payments systems and the uncoupling of retail and investment banking will mean in 2018 we're likely to witness both decentralisation - a decreased reliance on only a few major financial services companies - and devolution, as the sector grows its presence outside of London.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Decentralisation will be driven by the removal of some of the main barriers to scaling up for new entrants. The arrival of PSD2 will require banks to open their payments infrastructure to third parties, providing opportunities to develop innovative new solutions and offerings. Open banking will mean customer data can be shared seamlessly between banks and fintechs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What does this mean in practice? In isolation these regulations may have a limited impact, but combined they mean that individual customers will safely and securely be able to invite other companies to look at their financial data and offer them the right products at the right time. It is also going to mean that start-ups with good ideas will have better access to the same infrastructure that major players have.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The devolution of financial services is also partly driven by regulation. It is a by-product of ring fencing, which ensures banks' retail and investment activity is entirely separate. Front office investment banking and global headquarters will likely stay in London subject to the final outcome of the Brexit negotiations. But, as we have already seen, some larger retail banks, asset managers and insurers are picking alternatives outside of London for their UK headquarters. A number of regions across the country are finding their voice when it comes to making the case for financial services investment, and putting their money where their mouth is in terms of creating the right environment and infrastructure, and securing talent. Scotland, Manchester and Birmingham are &quot;the ones to watch&quot; in 2018.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our regulatory framework and progressive advancements in the application of financial technologies are often cited as the key reasons for the success of financial services in the UK, and are particularly important features as we navigate Brexit. Standards in the UK are rightly high and, with rising concerns over levels of consumer debt, a slowing economy and the impact of inflation, we are unlikely to see a relaxation any time soon. The impact of regulatory change is not often felt immediately, and we are unlikely to know the full impact of all the changes arriving in 2018 in the near future. What is clear, however, is that despite Brexit being the topic on everyone's lips for 2018, the next 12 months will be remembered as a time of progress for the industry, as it decentralises. By doing so, it will help maintain the UK's position as the world's leading financial centre.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This will be yet another seismic year for the financial services industry, and not just because of Brexit. Of course, the UK's decision to leave the EU will continue to attract considerable attention for the sector, given the importance of the EU to the City and vice versa . Securing a binding transition phase early in 2018, alongside a successful outcome for the future trading relationship, will be critical, but Brexit isn't the only force at play.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year will see the culmination of a number of regulatory interventions and policy changes, which will make the sector more resilient and more open to competition. The fabric of UK financial services could experience as big a change as we went through after the global financial crisis.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While predictions are fraught with danger; there are three trends that are likely to accelerate in 2018:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Firstly: increasing choice for consumers - initiatives such as open banking, which will launch in 2018,  will provide new entrants with further opportunities to grow. This increased competition will compel the major institutions to speed up the pace of change in their own businesses and drive further improvements to their products and services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Secondly: more financial services jobs outside of London - the ring fencing of banks, a key regulatory intervention to make the system safer and more resilient, will go live. This will see many geographical changes, including HSBC's ring-fenced bank launching in Birmingham. Combined with the need for the industry to be more efficient, it will help drive growth of UK financial services in areas outside of London.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thirdly: UK fintech goes mainstream  - spurred by larger companies collaborating with new innovators, exciting new apps and a supportive regulatory environment for new players, we expect to see consumers become increasingly aware of, and familiar with, using UK fintech products and services. We will continue to see rapid development of crypto-currencies and <SPAN style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&#8232;</SPAN>the use of artificial intelligence (AI); intensifying the debate on how we regulate these new areas, and protect against evolving cyber risks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   What is Fintech?                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We will see the introduction of a wave of new regulation that will enable change and drive increased competition. The simultaneous arrival of the general data protection regulation (GDPR), ring fencing, the payment services directive 2 (PSD2) and the UK's enforcement of open banking is potentially revolutionary. The focus on data-sharing, opening up the payments systems and the uncoupling of retail and investment banking will mean in 2018 we're likely to witness both decentralisation - a decreased reliance on only a few major financial services companies - and devolution, as the sector grows its presence outside of London.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Decentralisation will be driven by the removal of some of the main barriers to scaling up for new entrants. The arrival of PSD2 will require banks to open their payments infrastructure to third parties, providing opportunities to develop innovative new solutions and offerings. Open banking will mean customer data can be shared seamlessly between banks and fintechs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What does this mean in practice? In isolation these regulations may have a limited impact, but combined they mean that individual customers will safely and securely be able to invite other companies to look at their financial data and offer them the right products at the right time. It is also going to mean that start-ups with good ideas will have better access to the same infrastructure that major players have.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">.html-embed.component .quote.component{margin-left:0}.html-embed.component .quote.component .component-content{margin-right:16px}.quote__source, .quote__author {white-space: normal;}@media only screen and (min-width:730px){.html-embed.component .quote.component{margin-left:-60.83px}.html-embed.component .quote.component .quote__content:before{margin-left:-12px;padding-right:1px}}@media only screen and (min-width:1008px){.html-embed.component .quote.component{margin-left:-82.33px}}Scotland, Manchester and Birmingham are 'the ones to watch' in 2018</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The devolution of financial services is also partly driven by regulation. It is a by-product of ring fencing, which ensures banks' retail and investment activity is entirely separate. Front office investment banking and global headquarters will likely stay in London subject to the final outcome of the Brexit negotiations. But, as we have already seen, some larger retail banks, asset managers and insurers are picking alternatives outside of London for their UK headquarters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A number of regions across the country are finding their voice when it comes to making the case for financial services investment, and putting their money where their mouth is in terms of creating the right environment and infrastructure, and securing talent. Scotland, Manchester and Birmingham are &quot;the ones to watch&quot; in 2018.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our regulatory framework and progressive advancements in the application of financial technologies are often cited as the key reasons for the success of financial services in the UK, and are particularly important features as we navigate Brexit. Standards in the UK are rightly high and, with rising concerns over levels of consumer debt, a slowing economy and the impact of inflation, we are unlikely to see a relaxation any time soon. The impact of regulatory change is not often felt immediately, and we are unlikely to know the full impact of all the changes arriving in 2018 in the near future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is clear, however, is that despite Brexit being the topic on everyone's lips for 2018, the next 12 months will be remembered as a time of progress for the industry, as it decentralises. By doing so, it will help maintain the UK's position  as the world's leading financial centre .</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UK's retail industry will flatline at best in 2018 - and many shops should brace for a &quot;fight to survive&quot;, a leading think tank for the sector has warned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The KPMG/Ipsos Retail think tank, in a report published yesterday, argues that a cocktail of geopolitical and macroeconomic obstacles, combined with an increased number of regulatory compliance issues and persistent structural change, will present significant headwinds to businesses over the coming 12 months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lacklustre consumer spending will particularly hurt the sector, as a result of disposable incomes being squeezed by a jump in inflation coupled with stagnant wage growth, and the think tank said that the divide between non-food items and food items will widen - with demand for the former dented by higher prices for the latter.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The past year &quot;won't go down in the UK retail annals as a memorable one, simply because the challenging narrative barely made a detour&quot;, said Tim Denison, the think tank's co-chairman. He said that retailers in 2018 &quot;will be working manically behind the scenes reinventing the ways in which they deliver that all-important customer experience&quot; in order to compete with rivals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday's report also found that the sector could see more consolidation as a result of tricky trading conditions - or mergers and acquisitions - as the &quot;fight to survive&quot; continues to challenge players, especially smaller ones. The UK's competition regulator earlier this month cleared Tesco's &pound;3.7bn takeover of wholesaler Booker Group. In recent weeks, Unibail-Rodamco and shopping centre operator Westfield announced a major tie-up, mirroring a similar deal penned by Hammerson and Intu. Last year Sainsbury's acquired Argos, and over the summer - further afield - e-retail behemoth Amazon swallowed upmarket grocer Wholefoods in a bid to secure a bricks-and-mortar presence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paul Martin, UK head of retail at KPMG, said that going forward &quot;winning market share will remain a core focus for businesses&quot;. He said that mid-market clothing stores are likely to be particularly hit hard by squeezed consumer spending, along with other &quot;larger discretionary purchase categories&quot;. He also pointed out that &quot;store-based&quot; business models should prepare for a tough year ahead, as the popularity of online shopping continues to dominate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UK arm of US toy retailer Toys 'R' Us has in recent weeks made headlines with its struggle for survival. The business's online store has thrived, but its large warehouse-style outlets have fallen out of favour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other - perhaps less obvious - challenges for the retail sector in 2018 will stem from the regulatory environment, the think tank forecasts. In May 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) comes into effect, designed to strengthen data protection across Europe. Retailers will have to be acutely aware of the data they have on their customers and how it is used. Mr Martin said that the cost of non-compliance with GDPR could be substantial for retailers and that their reputation could be put at risk too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Brexit, the think tank said that it expects to see &quot;close correlation between the outcome of Brexit negotiations and the overall health of the industry&quot;. A soft Brexit would likely lead to meagre growth, while a hard Brexit could even see the market contract, it predicts. Consumer confidence, directly linked to Brexit, is also going to be a key determinant of the health of the sector. &quot;Continued uncertainty around Brexit and its implications is undoubtedly affecting consumer confidence, which is clearly on the wane,&quot; said Martin Newman, chief executive of e-commerce consultancy Practicology.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Official retail figures for November showed that annual sales growth was up in volume and value terms across UK retail, but the British Retail Consortium (BRC) has also struck a downbeat tone for 2018. &quot;Inflation, fuelled by the fall in the pound, has eaten into real incomes, leaving households with budgets that won't stretch as far,&quot; Rachel Lund, head of retail insight and analytics at the BRC, said earlier this month, adding that there is &quot;little sign of those dynamics changing any time soon&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The General Data Protection Regulation ( GDPR ) is a European Union directive that will come into force in May 2018.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It aims to create stronger and more unified protections of EU citizens' data - and for businesses of all sizes, this means complying with certain rules around consumer data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, not every firm is up-to-date.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A recent&nbsp;Close Brothers&nbsp; study &nbsp;of 900 small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) from across the UK and Ireland claimed that just one in four has started preparing for it, while one in three is aware of its implications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For starters, it's well worth reading the ICO's 12 Steps to Take Now document, but here are some other sensible starting points for meeting GDPR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Join the community | Share your small business storySource some help</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Miles Thorp, digital director at Banana Moon Clothing, thinks that businesses shouldn't be afraid to ask for help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hire someone full-time to handle GDPR or nominate an existing member of staff to be in charge and make sure that you're fully in the know and compliant by the deadline,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vivek Dodd, director at the training provider, Skillcast, adds that, depending on the size of the business, it can take months to get internal agreement on a&nbsp;GDPR message, how it's communicated, and follow through with any activities to reinforce that message, so don't leave&nbsp;it to the last minute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While some companies will want to keep it informal - using emails and team meetings, for example -&nbsp;others will prefer formal, mandatory training. &quot;There's no set formula,&quot; he says. &quot;But most businesses will have to employ both, and do so multiple times, to reinforce the message.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He suggests using a framework of three key objectives for any training, whether internal or external, to be successful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">.html-embed.component .quote.component{margin-left:0}.html-embed.component .quote.component .component-content{margin-right:16px}.quote__source, .quote__author {white-space: normal;}@media only screen and (min-width:730px){.html-embed.component .quote.component{margin-left:-60.83px}.html-embed.component .quote.component .quote__content:before{margin-left:-12px;padding-right:1px}}@media only screen and (min-width:1008px){.html-embed.component .quote.component{margin-left:-82.33px}}Privacy notices must be clear, concise and transparent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first is to raise awareness of the risks that potential GDPR breaches pose to the business, such as heavy fines and the potential loss of reputation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Second, ensure that everyone completes the necessary training, accepts the changes, and transitions successfully to the new compliance regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, he says, and most importantly: &quot;The training needs to be incorporated into induction procedures so that new staff are trained on GDPR issues before they have a chance to work with personal data.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Audit your data</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While also undertaking all the necessary research and preparation, SMEs must audit where all their customer data is collected and stored, says&nbsp;Julian Saunders, founder of data management and GDPR compliance company,&nbsp; PORT.im .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GDPR will require that firms protect data against &quot;unauthorised or unlawful&quot; processing, accidental loss, damage or destruction, he explains. &quot;The processes that businesses have in place to manage this data is crucial, which means using technology with the most up-to-date security settings.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Work out whether what you have is fit for purpose by determining whether you can isolate and view all of the data of a single data subject quickly and easily, advises Mr Saunders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If not, upgrading your existing systems is probably the best approach, because this will enable you to get the best value out of your data, become compliant, and be ready for further legislative changes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Check your 'opt-in' options</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SMEs must also prepare to obtain a &quot;positive opt-in&quot; for direct marketing to prospective and existing customers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under GDPR, this means that individuals must &quot;opt-in&quot; whenever data is collected on them (and not out).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Privacy notices must be clear, concise and transparent, explains Mr Dodd. &quot;Currently, many businesses use [opt-outs] -&nbsp;either a pre-checked ticked box or one that needs unchecking in order to capture permission, rather than a box that must be proactively ticked.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Individual rights</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sarah Brown, founder of business management consultancy, inspire2aspire, says that her main GDPR concern is checking that each of the firm's 8,000-plus contacts is happy with the way that the business is holding their records.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company has produced a detailed email to explain GDPR to its customers, so that they understand what's what.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The emails will trigger auto-responders to confirm that the recipient wants to unsubscribe from the newsletter or be removed completely from the [database] -&nbsp;and it offers them a chance to change their mind,&quot; explains Ms Brown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Remember, though, that big companies have been fined for trying to get individuals to change their marketing preferences, says Katrina Cliffe, the managing director at marketing, PR and social media agency, KC communications .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tread carefully; for example, you can't go back to individuals and ask them to opt back in, she warns.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE European Union is set to end the University of Cambridge's 300-yearold &quot;class list&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lists - where students' names are displayed alongside their degree grade on a board outside the university's main building Senate House - face abolition due to new data protection laws, which will come into force next year.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The issue has led to bitter divisions among the student body, with class lists having survived votes of confidence from both students and academic staff last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That came amid pressure from campaigners who argued that class lists were &quot;damaging&quot; to welfare, triggered depression and led to &quot;promoting a culture of shaming&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now the practice is under fresh threat from EU laws that place greater emphasis on &quot;active consent&quot; of subjects, rather than presumed consent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the General Data Protection Regulation, due to come into effect in May next year, the university may be legally required to ask for students' consent over whether they want their grades to be published.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cambridge's council, which is chaired by Stephen Toope, the vicechancellor, has backed a proposal to allow students to have their names removed from result lists through a simple tick-box option.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The final stage is for the proposal to be approved by Regent House, but Graham Virgo, pro-vice-chancellor for education, told Varsity, the student newspaper, that it was &quot;anticipated&quot; the new opt-out system will be in place by May, when the next examination period begins.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Currently, students can only opt out if they provide a valid medical reason for it and the university has to authorise the move. In a student referendum last month, 55 per cent said they wanted the student union to campaign to keep the list alive, and the following month academic staff followed suit in their own vote. Pressure to get rid of the list began in 2015 when a campaign called Our Grade, Our Choice called for students to have the choice to opt out of the lists without having to provide a reason.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It argued that the lists were &quot;damaging&quot; to the welfare of students and could trigger depression.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the prospect of their abolition deeply divided students, with an opposing campaign, titled Save the Class List, arguing that it was a &quot;fantastic tradition&quot;, and part and parcel of attending an ancient university.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Information Commissioner's Office said that the UK's decision to leave the EU will not affect the commencement of the GDPR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It argued that the lists were 'damaging' to the welfare of students and could trigger depression</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SCHOOLS and universities across the UK will be banned from publishing students' exam results under a complete overhaul of data protection rules imposed by Brussels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GETTY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Data Protection Bill: EU rules will mean schools cannot publish exam results without student consent</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new regulations mark the biggest change to data handling laws since they were introduced in the 1990s, and will require schools to gain the consent of students before making their grades public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And despite Britain's decision to split from the European Union, officials in the UK have confirmed the rules will still apply.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The General Data Protection Regulation , is set to come in to force in May 2018 and applies to any business, organisation or public body which handles personal information.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parliament is in the process of transferring the GDPR on to the UK's statue books, and the Government says it will &quot;empower people to take control of their data&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the new rules will potentially spell the end of a 300-year-old tradition at the University of Cambridge which sees degree results published alongside students' names.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;class list&quot; is posted on a board outside the university's Senate House, but university staff are already putting plans in to place to accommodate the new EU rules.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tradition has divided scholars at the prestigious institution, but a referendum in November last year found 55 per cent of students wanted the student union to campaign to keep the custom alive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However support for an opt out began in 2015 when a campaign argued the list was &quot;damaging&quot; to the welfare of students and could lead to depression.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GETTY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new data protection rules could mean the end of Cambridge's 'class list' tradition</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once the GDPR enters in to force, the Cheshire-based Information Commissioner's Office will be responsible for ensuring they are properly implemented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ICO said that the UK's decision to leave the EU will not affect the commencement of the new rules,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And this week advocacy organisation Universities UK met with ICO officials to discuss the GDPR.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a survey from Close Brothers, just one in four small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Britain have begun their compliance preparations ahead the new rules that come into effect next May, risking huge fines as a result.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Failure to be ready in time could see firms fined up to (EURO)20m (&pound;17.6m) or 4 per cent of their annual global turnover in the worst cases, Close Brothers said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) will introduce more stringent requirements around how firms maintain records of personal data, and will force companies to provide greater transparency to the public when breaches occur.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The research shows that just one in three SMEs are currently aware of GDPR's implications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some of the rules sound deceptively simple, but many firms will struggle to cope because they don't even have a clear idea of what data they currently hold on customers, or where and how it is stored,&quot; said David Thomson, chief executive of Close Brothers' invoice finance and rentals division.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Making an investment now in order to prepare and protect your business is essential if you do not want to risk incurring significant financial penalties - or the major reputational damage that a public breach of the new regulation would undoubtedly cause,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The number of fines handed out to firms for breakingUKdata protection laws almost doubled last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to figures from the UK's Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) analysed by professional services firm PwC, the number of fines for data protection breaches rose from 18 in 2015 to 35 in 2016 - amounting to &pound;3.2m in total.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After a year marked by devastating cyber attacks and breaches, online attackers are expected to become even more destructive in 2018, security researchers said Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A report by the security firm McAfee said the ransomware outbreaks of 2017 offer just a taste of what's to come as hackers develop new strategies and 'business models.'</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McAfee researchers said that as ransomware profitability fades in the face of new defenses, hackers will turn to new kinds of attacks that could involve damage or disruption of computers and networks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attackers will also look to target wealthy individuals and aim at connected devices which offer less security than computers and smartphones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'The evolution of ransomware in 2017 should remind us of how aggressively a threat can reinvent itself as attackers dramatically innovate and adjust to the successful efforts of defenders,' said Steve Grobman, McAfee's chief technology officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McAfee also predicted wider use of cyber attacks 'as a service,' allowing more hackers for hire to have an impact.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Raj Samani, chief scientist at McAfee, said the events of 2017 showed how easy it is to commercialize hacking services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Such attacks could be sold to parties seeking to paralyze national, political and business rivals,' Samani said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McAfee's 2018 Threats Predictions Report also said privacy is likely to be eroded further as consumer data - including data involving children - is gathered and marketed by device makers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Connected home device manufacturers and service providers will seek to overcome thin profit margins by gathering more of our personal data - with or without our agreement - turning the home into a corporate store front,' the McAfee report said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report said parents 'will become aware of notable corporate abuses of digital content generated by children,' as part of this effort to boost profitability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McAfee said it expects some impact for the May 2018 implementation of the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation, which limits how data is used and sold and which would affect companies with operations in the EU.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GDPR regulation 'makes 2018 a critical year for establishing how responsible businesses can pre-empt these issues, respecting users' privacy, responsibly using consumer data and content to enhance services, and setting limits on how long they can hold the data,' said McAfee vice president Vincent Weafer.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Data protection regulator the Information Commissioner's Office has said that it has &quot;huge concerns&quot; relating to Uber's cover-up of a massive data breach that came to light this week. Uber admitted on Tuesday that it had failed to disclose a cyberattack that exposed the data of some 57 million combined drivers and passengers -and paid hackers to not release the stolen data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement posted online, Uber chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi said that an October 2016 attack encompassed personal information like names and phone numbers of Uber users worldwide. In a blog post, he said two unnamed people outside the company had &quot;inappropriately accessed user data stored on a third-party cloud-based service&quot;, without breaching Uber's internal systems.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our outside forensics experts have not seen any indication that trip location history, credit card numbers, bank account numbers, social security numbers or dates of birth were downloaded,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The data stolen included the names and licence numbers of around 600,000 drivers in the US and unidentified &quot;personal information&quot; on 57 million drivers and users around the world, including the drivers described above including names, email addresses and mobile phone numbers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We took immediate steps to secure the data and shut down further unauthorised access by the individuals,&quot; Mr Khosrowshahi said.&quot;We subsequently identified the individuals and obtained assurances that the downloaded data had been destroyed. We also implemented security measures to restrict access to and strengthen controls on our cloud-based storage accounts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those responsible were reportedly pressured to sign non-disclosure agreements so news of the breach did not get out. The New York Times alleged that company executives had then dressed up the breach as a &quot;bug bounty&quot;, the practice of paying hackers to test the strength of software security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Affected accounts have been flagged for additional fraud protection, Mr Khosrowshahi said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;None of this should have happened, and I will not make excuses for it,&quot; he wrote. &quot;While I can't erase the past, I can commit on behalf of every Uber employee that we will learn from our mistakes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is the latest in a series of scandals to damage Uber's credibility, following Transport for London's refusal to renew its licence and the company's loss of an employment tribunal that ruled in favour of drivers demanding workers' rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday, the Information Commissioner's Office said that Uber's admission over the hack &quot;raises huge concerns around its data protection policies and ethics&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's always the company's responsibility to identify when UK citizens have been affected as part of a data breach and take steps to reduce any harm to consumers,&quot; said deputy commissioner James Dipple-Johnstone. &quot;If UK citizens were affected then we should have been notified so that we could assess and verify the impact on people whose data was exposed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that the ICO would be working with the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) and other relevant British and international authorities to determine the scale of the breach, and the extent to which it has affected people in the UK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Dipple-Johnstone said that the ICO and other agencies would also determine what steps need to be taken by Uber to ensure it fully complies with its data protection obligations. &quot;Deliberately concealing breaches from regulators and citizens could attract higher fines for companies,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokesperson for the NCSC, an arm of GCHQ, said companies must report any cyber attacks &quot;immediately&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The more information a company shares in a timely manner, the better able we are to support them and prevent others falling victim,&quot;he added. &quot;We are working closely with other agencies including the NCA and ICO to investigate how this breach has affected people in the UK and advise on appropriate mitigation measures. Based on current information, we have not seen evidence that financial details have been compromised.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Concerns about corporate cybersecurity have intensified in the wake of high-profile hacks targeting companies like Yahoo -which disclosed this year that all three billion of its email users' accounts were hacked in 2013 -and credit reporting agency Equifax, whose former CEO was grilled before Congress about security weaknesses that facilitated the attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According toBloomberg, the Uber hack cost Chief Security Officer Joe Sullivan and an associate their jobs because they sought to keep it quiet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alex Neill, managing director of home products and services at consumer's association Which?, said that data breaches are becoming increasingly common and the protections for consumers are lagging behind. &quot;The UK Government should use the Data Protection Bill to give independent bodies the power to seek collective redress on behalf of affected customers when a company has failed to take sufficient action following a data breach,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The EU-wide General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) will punish companies attempting to conceal breaches after it comes into force in May. The law, which the UK will remain part of after Brexit, will impose fines of up to Euro 20m (&pound;18m) or 4 per cent of the company's global annual turnover - whichever is higher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Proponents say it will harmonise national laws and &quot;protect and empower all EU citizens' data privacy and to reshape the way organisations across the region approach data privacy&quot;. It comes amid warnings over record levels of cyber crime, which are expected to continue rising as the techniques and programmes used become more easily obtained and operated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Around 1.8 million cyber-enabled crimes took place in England and Wales last year, mostly involving fraud for profit, but also including disruption and data breaches blamed on hostile states including Russia, Iran and North Korea.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ignorance made me feel comfortable to use them whilst not understanding the hate and the ramifications they carry. That isn't an excuse, I take responsibility for my mistakes and hope you can understand that my younger self doesn't reflect who I am today.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When you post something online - whether on a &quot;private&quot; social network like Facebook or a public one like Twitter - you're effectively recording it forever.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are various steps you can take to remove or delete old posts to get rid of things you may have regretted saying in the past. But even so, archived and cached copies may still be accessible to those who know how to get them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The best way to avoid any future embarrassment is to take a moment before posting anything and decide if you really, really want to share it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All that being said, here are a few ways to cover up your social media footprints.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Facebook goes after YouTubers and budding filmmakers with new 'Creators' app                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To start with, make a list of the online sites you visit frequently or can remember using in the past. Searching for your name (or any common usernames or tags) on various sites is a good way of turning up old information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This may include old message forums or social media sites (remember MySpace?) as well as playlist histories from things like Spotify or YouTube.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once you know which sites you spent the majority of time on, you can log back in and find the option to delete your old posts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     WhatsApp hack means 'unsent' messages can still be read after they've been deleted                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It may be tempting to simply delete the entire account and be done with it. However, many web properties will keep comments and images displayed even if the account is no longer active.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's why it's a good idea to go back and manually delete each individual post you made before silencing the account for good.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many online accounts will let you bulk-delete within a given time period, which will take some of the effort out of it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Twitter says it will take away your blue tick if you don't abide by its rules                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Any EU citizen can ask search engines like Google, Bing and Yahoo to remove any results connected to their name that are no longer relevant. This may include old relationships or jobs that you no longer want recorded. It also means that older social media pictures and posts are less likely to be easily accessible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Search engines have made it easy to make a request under the right to be forgotten. For example, Google requires you to fill out a form thatcan be found here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, this will only apply to links listed in the European Union - as soon as you head out of the EU (such as to the US) the links will still be visible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Here's why you should never use full stops in your texts, according to science                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In May 2018, the EU will bring into force a new data privacy regulation known as GDPR that aims to give individuals more control over how their personal information is stored and processed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When it comes into force, anyone will be able to request that a website remove the personal data they hold - providing it is not of historical or scientific importance, which embarrassing old posts are unlikely to be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Brexitwill have no impact on GDPR as all the legislation will be applicable in the UK's new Data Protection Bill.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An investigation is underway after the personal details of British Uber customers were feared stolen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ride-sharing app&nbsp;paid hackers $100,000 (&pound;75,000) to delete data belonging to 57 million customers and drivers worldwide and keep quiet about the breach, it revealed on Tuesday night.&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Wednesday the Information Commissioner's Office, the UK's data watchdog, suggested that the beleaguered tech firm could face fines for the cover-up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Uber's announcement about a concealed data breach last October raises huge concerns around its data protection policies and ethics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If UK citizens were affected then we should have been notified so that we could assess and verify the impact on people whose data was exposed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Deliberately concealing breaches from regulators and citizens could attract higher fines for companies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Uber founder Travis Kalanick was in charge when the breach took place but has since resigned as chief executive</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It will work with the National Cyber Security Centre to determine the scale of the breach and how it has affected British riders.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Uber has not confirmed which countries have been affected, but founder Travis Kalanick said in October 2016 - the same month as the breach - that its entire global customer base was 40 million, which suggests&nbsp;that the vast majority of its accounts had been breached.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company now has 65 million active riders globally. In the UK it has 5 million active riders - those who have taken a trip in the last three months - including 3.5 million in London.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tech company&nbsp;has 3.5 million active riders in London alone, where it is trying to win back its licence from Transport for London . &nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company, valued at almost $70bn, has suffered several setbacks caused by internal bickering, sexual harassment scandals and the resignation of controversial Mr Kalanick. He was replaced in August by Dara Khosrowshahi, who has promised to fix the company's culture and repair relationships with regulators like Transport for London.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Uber controversies timeline</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Khosrowshahi revealed the hack on Tuesday evening and fire Uber's security chief and&nbsp;former Facebook lead Joe Sullivan over the debacle.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coming clean about the breach, he&nbsp;revealed names, email addresses and mobile numbers along with the license numbers of around 6000,000 drivers in the United States were stolen.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">External forensic experts hired by the company claimed there was &quot;no indication&quot; that trip location history, credit card numbers, bank account numbers of dates of birth were downloaded. Uber will&nbsp;notify affected drivers by email but did not say whether it would contact individual riders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The National Cyber Security Centre appeared to confirm that financial details had not been breached.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Based on current information, we have not seen evidence that financial details have been compromised,&quot; a spokesperson said.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two hackers, not believed to be employees, were able to access the information after workers left keys to the company's cloud account on GitHub, a site where developers can share software code.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Higgins, cyber security expert at CyberArk said that the breach was &quot;bad practice&quot; but it was likely that &quot;opportunists&quot; had found the information before bribing the company.&nbsp; He suggested that breaches were a regular occurrence within the tech industry thanks to lack of regulation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Uber aren't alone in this and until GDPR comes in next year there isn't currently any legal mandate,&quot; he said.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These days, the run-up to the Budget brings with it a tightening knot in the stomach for British small businesses and the self-employed. And it's no surprise.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back in March the announcement (and then swift U-turn) of a dramatic tax hike for the self-employed made us all wince.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It wasn't just the principle of putting up Class 4 National Insurance contributions, it was the general spirit behind the move.&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It demonstrated a lack of understanding about the risk involved in working for yourself - and worse, it suggested this kind of economic endeavour is not appreciated and unwelcome.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The big worry for next week is the potential lowering of the VAT threshold.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Currently set at &pound;85,000, the very fact that the Chancellor asked the Office of Tax Simplification to examine the case for and against would suggest a very serious intent in the Treasury to raid yet more cash from small business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our members tell us the timing for this is all wrong. Small firms are dealing with Brexit, General Data Protection Regulation, rising auto enrolment contributions with Making Tax Digital on the horizon for VAT-registered firms expected to start in 2019, it makes a great deal of sense to make sure it stays where it is.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On another note, is it fair to ask consumers to pay 20 per cent more for coffee from an independent cafe when larger firms can afford to charge less?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, we hope the Chancellor will consider some of the following measures that would actually help small businesses at this critical moment.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Export vouchers to help prepare for Brexit                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                         Emma Jones&nbsp;                       </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Emma Jones, is an entrepreneur and the founder of small business support group Enterprise Nation </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Small companies that export are much more likely to be focused on trade with the EU. Currently, this is a very straightforward thing to do.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, once we leave the EU, trade will inevitably be more complicated, at least initially.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An Export Vouchers programme would both stimulate the private sector market - as it would use government funds to ensure export experts are matched with small businesses - and it would also show the Government recognises the fact that smaller firms will need a helping hand.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is so much export specialist talent in the market - and so much potential for young firms to sell worldwide - what's required is a platform to match the two and a nudge from government to make the connection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Broadband and digital training                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Industrial Strategy needs to reflect the growing digital needs of small businesses and start-ups and its important impact on the British economy.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Broadband, or lack of it, disproportionately affects smaller firms and those operating in the rural economy. It makes sense to see digital training offered as super-fast broadband is rolled out across the UK more quickly so that smaller firms, that are not yet digitally-savvy enough to take advantage of this, can be part of the growth equation - and avoid hefty fines from new data protection rules GDPR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Prompt payment                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far more than 2,000 firms have signed up to the Prompt Payment Code, but it's never going to be enough until it's made compulsory for large employers to pay their small suppliers on time.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once tech giants and huge corporates that genuinely use the products and services of smaller producers sign up, then we will have progress on this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Business rates                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We hear from our members that the hike in business rates has been an unprecedented problem, with some reporting increases in rates of more than 200 per cent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While transitional relief has been patchy and in some cases, unattainable, we'd like to see a situation when common sense is applied, linking business rates with actual profits rather than commercial property values.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While some firms absolutely have seen the property their business occupies go up, they may not have seen an increase in turnover. The Government has got to stop causing disruption and provide stability in order to create growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Bring the self-employed into auto enrolment                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We all need a nudge on this as it seems there is still a gap within the haves and have-nots in terms of pension provision.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bringing the self-employed in now would avoid some of them finding the cupboard is literally bare when retirement finally arrives.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     What will be in the Budget... and what should be? Listen to the This is Money Podcast&nbsp;                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the last Budget mess, the snap election that went wrong, the unexpected rise of Corbynism, and the Brexit arguments that just won't go away, the Chancellor will hope that he can get everything back on track on Wednesday.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So what could he deliver - and what should he?&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From help for younger people, to stamp duty cuts, pension tinkering, building more homes and just fixing the roads, in this week's podcast Simon Lambert, Georgie Frost and Rachel Rickard Straus take a run through what might come up - and what they think should be done.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mumsnet now has levels of online security on a par with what you might expect from your bank - but then the popular parent site has been hacked twice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Privacy is at stake because some Mumsnetters air their innermost thoughts online, believing they are protected by anonymity. So when cybercriminals hacked the site in 2014 and 2015, 1.5 million users were asked twice to reset their details.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such is the devotion of users that Mumsnet weathered the storm. &quot;I think we've reclaimed our trust but it was definitely a moment of crisis,&quot; Mumsnet's head of policy and campaigns, Rowan Davies, told The Telegraph's Festival of Business. Backroom security has been beefed to be with the breached Decoded up and moderators regularly reminded of how easy it is to open the door to cybercriminals.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It appears no longer a question of if but when a business will be hacked, say cybersecurity professionals. &quot;Companies need to be comfortable with the idea of being breached,&quot; says Sam Nixon, product owner of technology educator Decoded. Information security needs prominence at board level, rather than remaining a backroom operation. &quot;It's not a hindrance. It's a core part of the business and that's how you need to think about it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE IMPACT OF REMOTE WORKING</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A cultural shift has taken place at work, particularly among millennials, says Phil Lander, director of mobile and IT, B2B, at Samsung Europe.Mobile technology means personal life spills into working life and vice versa. And as more employees use their own smartphones for work, a company's systems are potentially more vulnerable to infiltration. &quot;The working day has changed,&quot; says Mr Lander. &quot;More people are accessing systems remotely.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year 46pc of businesses in the UK suffered a cyber-attack, the latest government figures show - nearly twice as many as the previous year. Costs of breaches vary but can prove catastrophic for smaller firms, says Mr Lander. But Samsung's research shows that while 70pc of larger organisations say cybersecurity ranks in their top three concerns, just 30pc of smaller businesses agree.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But by 2020, 70pc of workers in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are expected to be mobile employees and that changes the shape of the security needs for these businesses,&quot; he says. &quot;Research shows that in 2015-16 in the UK alone, businesses spent &pound;10.9m on cybercrime. It's a big problem.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A TWIN-DEFENCE APPROACH</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are two ways to hack a business: through the technology itself or through the people who work there. And building defences to keep out cybercriminals requires a twin approach along these lines, says Mr Lander.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're in an age of digital Darwinism - the internet of things, artificial intelligence, mobilisation. There're so many choices - why not embrace it?&quot; Samsung, for instance, has just helped TSB to become the first UK bank to install iris recognition technology as a security layer for consumers. &quot;So the technology is there - you need to find the solution you need.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But more often than not, human error gives cybercriminals the &quot;in&quot; they need to wreak havoc. Mumsnet's second security breach occurred after a phishing attack - a fake message designed to trick an individual into revealing personal information. Thousands of highly convincing scam messages are sent every day - and so individual staff, including increasing numbers of remote workers, need to be kept aware.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People might feel ashamed that they have been scammed,&quot; says Ms Davies. In fact, they should broadcast it as an example, and company culture should welcome this, she says. &quot;Whenever our tech team sees something dodgy - a phishing email, say - they forward it to staff saying 'here's an example of a scam'. Falling for it shouldn't be shaming.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attacks are not always online - criminals might gain access through a phone call, even in person, says Mr Nixon. But once they're in a system, passwords are often lamentably easy to crack. &quot;Phishing is the biggest threat by far faced by organisations, but is rarely used in isolation. Think of it like being conned. Password managers are a cheap solution to this. Or having two-stage authentication - such as having to enter a code from your phone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having a plan when it all goes wrong is also essential, says Mr Lander. And when new GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) comes into force next May, businesses will be obliged to report certain security breaches within 72 hours after becoming aware. &quot;You need to run through potential scenarios,&quot; he says. &quot;Each team, from comms to technical, should know their role when the crisis hits. Education is key.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">High street pawnbroker Cash Converters has revealed it's suffered a data breach that could mean a number of customers are 'at risk'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The firm, which sells small loans and second-hand jewellery, has warned that its old online website that was withdrawn on 22 September had fallen victim to hackers before being taken down.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's now claiming people who had one of its Webshop accounts on cashconverters.co.uk before this date, could be at risk, according to MoneySavingExpert.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cash Converters said that sensitive data, including customers' usernames, passwords and delivery addresses have potentially been accessed by a third party, but confirmed that no credit card information was compromised as part of the breach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     TV Licence fee refund - the dangerous scam email spreading fast and the real refunds you might qualify for                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is now contacting customers of the old Webshop site with details to help protect them from being impacted by the security breach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you have or have had a Cash Converters account online, it's advised that you change your password - including on websites and log-ins where the same password has been used.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you receive anything suspicious, report it through Cash Converters orAction Fraud.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     The shopping mistake that could cost you &pound;893 - and you don't even get what you ordered                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A statement from Cash Converters said: &quot;Along with the relevant authorities we are investigating this as a matter of urgency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are also actively implementing measures to ensure that this cannot happen again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jon Topper, at infrastructure consultancy The Scale Factory added: &quot;Initial reports of this breach suggest that the data was exfiltrated from an older version of the Cash Converters web shop, which was no longer in use by customers, but was still apparently online.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When migrating away from old solutions it's important to bear in mind that old digital assets will still be running and available online until such time as they are fully decommissioned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As a result they should still be treated as &quot;live&quot;, which means maintaining a good security posture around them, keeping up with patching and so forth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In their customer notification, Cash Converters were quick to point out that the old site was operated by a third party, possibly intending to deflect responsibility for this breach, which definitely won't fly under GDPR regulations coming into force next year. Companies running server infrastructure that handles customer data should be engaging with experts to review their security posture ahead of that, in order to avoid being slapped with a large fine.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IF DATA are the new oil, does that make Experian the new BP? The &pound;15bn credit checker has been a FTSE 100 stalwart since it gained its independence from retailer Argos a little over a decade ago, but the dividend yield of 2pc is a long way short of the payout gusher investors rely on from the energy giant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The voguish expression refers less to shareholder returns and more to the growth in a valuable resource that will power the economy long after BP's last well has run dry.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How much easier it is to profit by drilling into reams of information instead of the bowels of the earth, an unstable occupation that can lead to disasters such as the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. But data is not without risk, as the numerous organisations that have suffered cyber Experian Avoid attacks this year show. Experian has four divisions. Credit services accounts for half of the business and it collects and analyses more than one billion credit histories to inform lenders and credit card firms if new customers are a safe bet. Decision analytics uses data to minimise fraud risk and spot which customers have grown unhappy with the service they are receiving. Marketing services enables clients to plan their marketing campaigns and track responses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fourth division, consumer services, lets individuals monitor their credit score. It has been the laggard as Experian attempts to create a giant, free membership base from which it can generate new revenues. So far it has 12m members signed up in the UK and US, and high hopes for IdentityWorks, a subscription-based identity monitoring service, and LendingWorks, a comparison service for loans and credit cards. The last quarter illustrates the challenge. Group underlying sales growth was 4pc, with decision analytics and marketing services strongly ahead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, consumer services slid 8pc with particular weakness in the UK. Analysts at Goldman Sachs remain bullish on the division, pointing out that the new products introduced in the US should gain scale as they are rolled out in the coming months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That may contribute to a return to growth in the second half. Watch out for signs of divisional progress when half-year results are posted on Nov 15. Experian shares have been directionless this year. They currently trade 7pc below their May peak, reached around the time of their full-year results announcement, but 9pc higher than the trough they hit in the aftermath of the Equifax data breach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Experian's American rival made headlines for one of the largest-ever data breaches as personal details of 143m Americans were compromised after a cyber attack. Equifax is not alone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Experian had its crisis early when the details of 15m T-Mobile customers leaked out two years ago. This time around, Experian might be able to increase market share at the expense of Equifax, but, all things being equal, data is going to become a more expensive business. US politicians are training their sights on the industry. Experian boss Brian Cassin was among several consumer credit checking leaders that declined to appear before a panel of House Democrats late last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On this side of the Atlantic, the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which comes into force next May, makes life harder for any company managing consumer data, with harsher fines promised for those that fail to protect sufficiently against attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of greater concern is the credit outlook. Central bankers are becoming exercised about credit bubbles, with car finance and credit cards areas of worry. Banks are reining in offers and rising interest rates stand to cool matters further. Experian is reliant on the volume of activity. While pointing out the high barriers to entry in this sector, Morgan Stanley reduced its forecasts for the credit services division in the UK and US over summer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Experian has a strong balance sheet, with a $600m share buy-back promised this year on top of $734m repurchased last year. The group has also shown willingness to tighten its portfolio. Earlier this year it sold a majority stake in its low-margin email marketing arm in a transaction that gave the unit a &pound;320m enterprise value. But trading at close to 20 times next year's forecast earnings, Experian shares should be avoided for now. Better sticking with oil instead.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We all know about the Data Protection Act - the rules that govern who gains, keeps and distributes your all-important personal data and how. As headlines of massive data breaches have broken one after another like one long line of waves onto the shores of privacy, it has become increasingly important - albeit in an oddly abstract way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But now a major shake-up is on the cards that will radically shift the power of ownership back into the hands of the little people. And most of us know nothing about it. From next May, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) will replace the Data Protection Act, bringing with it all sorts of requirements to make companies take far greater care of the personal data they hold about us.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taking back control</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They will, for example, have to declare if there is a breach or loss of that data immediately. They will also have to provide valid reasons, founded in law, for asking for deeply private information, such as our sexuality or religion. Meanwhile, businesses will need a real person in place who can be held accountable for the way information is stored and used.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But while that is all important, the biggest change is that individuals will be able to ask for a copy of the information held about them. Known as a Subject Access Request or SAR, customers and clients should expect a response within 30 days, with failure to comply potentially carrying a fine worth 4 per cent of the entire business's turnover.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a regulation that comes from the European Parliament, the Council of the European Union and the European Commission in a bid to unify data protection for all citizens of the European Union while clamping down on the way data is exported out of the EU. As it is not a directive that would require national governments to pass legislation to make it law, it will become binding and applicable in the UK regardless of Brexit. Indeed, for British consumers it could not have come at a more opportune time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the dark</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A third of UK adults are now concerned about their personal data falling into the wrong hands - both through illegal hacking and the infuriating but perfectly legal practice (with the right permissions) of selling data on. Customers are already able to ask for the information but it involves a fee and can take up to 40 days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barely 30 per cent of us know that the GDPR legislation is on its way. Financial services providers in particular may be hoping it stays that way as many predict an avalanche of requests is set to engulf the customer services arms of our major banks and building societies. Almost 60 per cent of all UK consumers are expected to demand such information, which should be delivered in a &quot;permanent&quot; format, mostly paper, which is causing some security headaches in itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Julie Evans, chief operating officer of Exonar, one of the businesses to have sprung up in response to the legislation, said May will mark a turning point in privacy and companies should expect that millions of us will be raising a SAR. &quot;The good news for consumers is they won't be charged to obtain the information companies hold on them and they will have a far greater say in how the information is used,&quot; she said. &quot;They'll even have the 'right to be forgotten'. But at the moment people are ignorant about the changes. That's good news for businesses because they need all the time they can get to be ready to deal with the influx in requests. Take the banking sector for example, around 21 million of us have a current account, so the banks could expect to see around seven million people raise a SAR. NatWest even tweeted recently that it thinks there will be huge demand in SARs when it drops the &pound;10 fee.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Information avalanche</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the effect will not just be felt by banks. Almost two in five people will ask their credit card provider or social media platform what information they have. About one in ten will ask for records from a mobile network provider or a utility company and one in 20 will demand records from retailers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The cost to business will be huge,&quot; Evans adds. &quot;Just imagine the time a bank will need to take copies of all the information held about an individual across all the different departments; bank statements, credit card information, insurance details, CRM data, credit checks, emails and letters etc. There's no way to recoup this cost other than to put prices up across the board.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the right to be forgotten also set to be enshrined in the GDPR, some also predict a PPI style industry will develop. Meanwhile, all that paper has also drawn concerns from environmentalists.</SPAN></P>

But increased cyber terrors have had the effect of making shares in Sophos a safe haven. They listed at 225p in mid-2015 and only got traction this year, doubling in the last seven months. At a recent capital markets day, the company nudged up its forecast this year for growth in billings - which it focuses on instead of revenues - to circa doubled Growth Wait for entry 20pc compared with the previous guidance of mid to high-teens.

Twin threats to business are twin opportunities for Sophos. Attacks of the type suffered by the NHS, TalkTalk and Equifax, the US credit ratings agency, that compromise personal data and cripple operations are not going to end any time soon. But the responsibility for guarding against those attacks will fall more squarely on the individual company under the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) that comes into force next May. Broadband provider TalkTalk was hit with a &pound;400,000 fine for security failings after a hack in October 2015. Bit it might have had to stump many times that under new rules, which in the UK will punish firms that don't adequately protect customers' details with fines of up to &pound;17m, or 4pc of global turnover. Although Elizabeth Denham, the Information Commissioner, points out that multi million-pound fines are unlikely to be levied on a regular basis, it makes investing in better cyber protection a no-brainer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sophos operates at both ends of the spectrum - providing software that keeps networks safe, as well as remote end users on laptops or smartphones that might be targeted by being sent dangerous web links or unwanted apps.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company is also trying to encourage customers to upgrade by launching next-generation product lines such as Intercept X for end users. Morgan Stanley believes there is significant room for further cross-selling because less than 10pc of Sophos customers take both network and end-user packages from them. Kris Hagerman, the chief executive, has increased the number of resellers the group uses by 50pc in the last year to bring new clients through the door. Investors appear more focused on renewal rates. Going into this financial year, the total subscription renewal book of $823m (&pound;624m) was 22pc higher than a year ago, UBS points out.

Many that do list in London don't last, given overseas interest in buying up the UK's data-driven champions has been sharpened by the weak pound.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That Sophos shares are still available might have something to do with the 22pc stake owned by private equity backer Apax, and the 9pc apiece held by founders Jan Hruska and Peter Lammer, who set up Sophos in a front room in 1985 after meeting as postgraduates at Oxford. Its strong run has closed the valuation gap with American peers.

<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Switching levels have dropped 15.7% in a year&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nationwide Building Society is the clear winner in the current account switching battle, attracting nearly four times as many customers as its nearest rivals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Britain's biggest mutual won over 38,683 more switchers than it lost in the first three months of the year, according to the latest data from payment provider Bacs.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The figures also reveal, however, that appetite for switching has dipped 15.7 per cent in the 12 months to the end of September 2017 with 892,643 switches compared to 1,059,674 in the same period a year earlier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is despite the current account switching advertising campaign reaching 93 per cent of the adult population and 99.4 per cent of switches being completed in a seven-day timeframe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Drilling into the data, Nationwide top the charts for switchers.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many have been tempted into its FlexDirect offering, which comes with five per cent interest on &pound;2,500 in the first 12 months of opening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Santander, which frequently topped the current account switching charts in recent years, saw 24,019 switch to the bank - but lost 26,305. This is doubtless a result of its 123 current account no longer offering a top tier of three per cent of interest on balances up to &pound;20,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of the high street giants lost far more switchers than they gained, the figures show.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The biggest losers were Barclays, with a net 16,056 switching away from the bank.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NatWest lost a net 10,264 customers who switched elsewhere, Lloyds Bank 8,765 and RBS 7,516.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another big loser was Clydesdale Bank, where a net 12,857 left the bank for pastures new.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This may partly suggest why it is now offering a &pound;250 switching incentive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Behind Nationwide, TSB had a net inflow of 11,750 customers, followed by HSBC at 8,686 - although the HSBC figures also include popular First Direct and M&amp;S Bank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Halifax saw a net inflow of 4,979 customers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The switching service has helped move 4.2million accounts since it launched in 2013 - but the drop off of those using the service may suggest that people are switching and sticking with their new provider.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report added: 'The advent of Open Banking, PSD2 and GDPR will make it more important than ever to look beyond headline figures, such as switching volumes and customer awareness, to understand better how the market is responding.'&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We round up some of the best deals on offer below:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Free money and incentives</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clydesdale and Yorkshire Bank off-shoot, B, is currently offering &pound;250 to anyone that switches to its current account. The app-based bank offers low overdraft fees extra budgeting and saving features.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HSBC offers the second largest sign-up bonus at &pound;200 if you switch to its Advance Account.&nbsp;It waives overdraft fees for six months and offers access to exclusive products including a 5 per cent regular saver but the account requires a &pound;1,750 minimum deposit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First Direct pays &pound;125 to new customers who switch to its&nbsp;  First Account &nbsp;(until December 11). The account comes with a &pound;250 fee-free overdraft buffer and access to its popular Regular Saver, paying 5 per cent on up to &pound;3,600 per year (&pound;300 per month).  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> M&amp;S Bank's current account &nbsp;has a &pound;185 gift card offer for switching to it. That's &pound;125 when you sign up and &pound;5 per month for up to 12 months, as long as you pay in &pound;1,000 per month. You also get 1 point for every &pound;1 spent on your M&amp;S debit card in store in the M&amp;S Loyalty Scheme. An attached regular saver pays 5 per cent.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Halifax is offering &pound;125 to switch to one of its current accounts. Those with a&nbsp; Reward Account  also get a &pound;3 monthly reward if they pay in &pound;750 and maintain two direct debits. &nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The best interest-paying accounts</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The best interest-paying account for you will depend on the level of your balance and your monthly deposit amount.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Santander's 123 Account to&nbsp;1.5 per cent interest on up to &pound;20,000, a top deal for anyone with a large balance. It also pays up to 3 per cent tiered cashback on household bills, however&nbsp;it has a monthly charge of &pound;5.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Nationwide FlexDirect  pays 5 per cent interest on balances up to &pound;2,500 -&nbsp;but this only for the first year. You must pay in a minimum monthly income of &pound;1,000.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TSB's Classic Plus account  offers 3 per cent interest on the first &pound;1,500 in your account plus you get up to &pound;10 each month if you maintain two direct debits from the account and make at least 20 debit card payments a month (until June 2018).

</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cyber security is big news at the moment. It seems that every other week there are reports that yet another company has been attacked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">US credit score giant Equifax reported in September that around 145million of its customers had their accounts hacked earlier this year, with more than 15 million of those in the UK.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's an awful lot of sensitive information to be stolen, but pales in comparison to the three billion accounts that Yahoo recently revealed were breached back in 2013. That's almost half of the world's population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And they are just a couple of examples we know about.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the moment firms are under no real obligation to disclose when their systems have been compromised, although that is set to change pretty soon with the introduction of new data protection rules (GDPR) next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From May, every time there is a data breach it has to be notified publicly, something that bodes well for Osirium Technologies and its chief executive David Guyatt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stand by for the number of breaches announced to double in 2018 as a result of the new rules, he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Simply put, Osirium is a cyber security specialist and the more publicity generated by database hacks, the larger the potential for its software.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Markets are becoming aware of this potential, too. Since the last results in September, the value of the AIM-listed group has risen by two-thirds but brokers such as Stifel believe this is just the start.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Osirium's software has twin customer benefits, said the broker, lower cyber risk and more productive IT departments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'The product attributes of 'simple to use' and 'easy to deploy' technology are resonating with target upper mid-market customers,' the broker added, which was evident in the last interim results with bookings ahead by 393 per cent year-on-year and revenue up by 59 per cent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guyatt explains it like this: 'Every piece of IT kit has privileged access, which is what the technical staff [sysadmins] use to manage networks, maintain, upgrade and so on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Most cyber attacks look eventually to get hold of privileged accounts, so imagine a world where you have no control over the people who have this privileged access to your IT systems.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Orisium's product makes sure that the right level of privileges are granted to the right people so that they can do their jobs, but without opening up huge golden arches for cyber attackers.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Banks, financial services companies and insurers are major users of privileged access management security (PAM), a market globally expected to be worth more than US$2 billion by 2020.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Early versions of PAM needed an 'army of consultants' to run as it was so complicated, says Guyatt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A legacy of this is that many larger organisations have 3-4 times as many privileged accounts as users.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When an employee or contractor leaves, often their credentials are never erased, usernames/passwords being hard to change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Osirium's functionality ensures that routine IT processes are packaged as tasks and automated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Introducing this task automation has been a game changer and gives an important competitive advantage, believes Guyatt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We are the first in cyber security space to do this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We don't give sysadmins access to privileged accounts, they just press the button and Osirium does the task for them.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Osirium is still in its early stages and Stifel expects sales to jump from an estimated &pound;600,000 this year to &pound;900,000 in 2018, which is as far it is estimating currently, but it acknowledges the opportunity further out is substantial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After taking on eight customers in the first half of 2017, the same number again were signed up in the next three months and evidence of the build-up in momentum says Guyatt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Osirium bills by subscription, with subscription terms typically lasting between 12-36 months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a SaaS/pay-as you-go business, the underlying financial model is cash-generative and its operations generate annuity revenue streams, says Stifel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Customers so far have also typically upgraded both the services and the number of devices being monitored.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Small software companies can suffer growing pains but Osirium's management should have the experience to make the most of the opportunity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guyatt was a co-founder of Content Technologies (CT) -an early UK tech investor of the type now called unicorns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fellow co-founder Andy Harris is Osirium's chief technology officer and Catherine Jamieson, another CT veteran, is chief operating officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Content Technologies sold its MIMEsweeper software business in 2000 for around &pound;670million and Guyatt believes the mood now is similar due to the growing cyber attack threat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Awareness, understanding and intelligent budgeting for projects is what's forcing it [the market] forward now.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At 161p, Osirium, which floated last year at 156p, is valued at about &pound;17million.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For many companies, the greatest threat lies not in competition but in the staggeringly incomplete picture they have of their own operations. You may think that most big corporations would be able to pull up at the press of a button information on the size of their wages bill or where they store their customer data, but you'd probably be wrong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just how insulated many senior executives are from vital back-office business functions has been revealed by a raft of new corporate transparency requirements, including gender pay reporting rules and the general data protection regulation, or GDPR.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The madness of the gender pay gap, which generally results from women holding the majority of lower-paid junior roles and far fewer reaching the top, has persisted in part because it has been so hard to measure and is not immediately visible. Yet as companies try to help to rectify this and prepare to publish their gender pay gap statistics by next April's deadline, many are complaining that it's too hard to capture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A big part of the problem for large companies that have grown through acquisition or have multiple sites is that they may use three, or even 33, different types of payroll software in different units. Trying to get discrete systems to talk to each other is often a huge task that many companies simply avoid. As Debi O'Donovan, director of the Reward &amp; Employee Benefits Association, notes, if a patchwork of incompatible systems is working and people are getting paid on time, most companies see no reason to change anything, even it does cloud their overall picture of their workforce.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then there's the question of who a company employs. If an entire IT department is permanently staffed by contractors, who traditionally are male and relatively well-paid, they ought to be included in gender pay reports, even if they are not, strictly speaking, employees because they reflect the wider picture on pay. Yet if contractors, agency workers or ad hoc consultants, however often they turn up in the office, are paid through the procurement department, not payroll, they may not be so easily visible to the people responsible for gender pay reporting. There's a good chance, says Rita Trehan, an HR consultant, that the HR director has a very different view of &quot;people costs&quot; than the finance director. Who is right? The introduction of real-time information rules, which require companies to submit PAYE information to Revenue &amp; Customs every time that employees are paid, rather than annually, has led to some improvements on this front. So, too, have the new pensions auto enrolment rules. But it's not enough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When it comes to the GDPR rules that from next May will require companies to keep a record of how and when individuals give consent to store and use their personal information, as well as a right to have their data deleted, similar obstacles exist. While companies in highly regulated systems, such as banking or telecoms, may be able to do this, many others won't find it easy. Data isn't always instantly available, or even visible, as large companies may have numerous databases on PCs and servers on the premises and with multiple cloud providers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This tyranny of data, which has grown since the 1990s' global explosion of digital information, is as much a problem for companies as for society. Data adds value only when it's accessible and accurate, not when it is obscuring the truth. Forcing companies to clean house is expensive and hard, but hopefully it will benefit everyone in the end. As well as boosting corporate efficiency, it might also rebuild customer and employee trust that their data is being captured and used for their own good.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Breaches will have to be reported, for example.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those who fail to comply with the EU rules from May 2018 face a fine of up to (EURO)20million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, a survey of almost 900 members of the Institute of Directors (IoD) released today shows 30 per cent of directors have not heard of GDPR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The IoD believes one reason for this is directors are being pulled in so many different directions in the run-up to Brexit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The IoD's Jamie Kerr said: &quot;It was clear from the outset that this change would be a mammoth task for small and large businesses alike.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether we're reading tailored social media news feeds or scrolling through lists of movies that have been chosen especially for us, the consumer is existing in an increasingly personalised world.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Technology is putting the individual at the centre of everything, which means that the approach of blanketing whole sections of society  with the same messages is no longer good enough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a recent study by PwC's Digital Services, 94pc of top execs felt that delivering personalisation was&nbsp; critical &nbsp;to reaching and retaining customers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also known as one-to-one marketing, personalisation is now being surpassed by &quot;hyper-personalisation&quot;, where tailoring a message, service or price to one specific person is done right down to the most granular level using technology, such as artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning and real-time analytics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Join the community | Share your small business storyAutomated ad buying</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marketing tech company,&nbsp; Cablato, uses programmatic advertising (where a machine buys digital ads rather than a human) and real-time data to create ad campaigns designed for a specific individual. Programmatic machines make decisions about what will work best, for whom, and when, all in just five milliseconds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joey Gartell, Cablato's strategy director, says that its tech has seen ad effectiveness increase by a factor of 10: &quot;Using data and machine learning to drive content personalisation is transforming marketing performance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company's clients can access and use a number of available data sets, including price, location, weather and behavioural data, to recommend their content and products to consumers. This helps them make more informed choices and, importantly, increases sales and marketing efficiency, adds Mr Gartell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bespoke recommendations</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime harness a recommendation engine to personalise our viewing based on our previous watching habits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clive Malcher, senior vice president at video products and services company,&nbsp; Piksel, says that soon, the advertising that we see alongside films and TV programming will be just as bespoke.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;AI means that we're more informed than ever about what's out there for us. Companies are connecting with their audiences on a much deeper level, and it's natural that this would enter people's living rooms,&quot; says Mr Malcher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Targeted ad breaks, TV guides, and even personalised product placement are all on the horizon, he adds. There are a range of systems that small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) can employ to improve how they tailor their services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Email insight</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garden furniture specialist,&nbsp; Alexander Francis, uses a scalable cloud-based system from retail management platform,&nbsp; Bright Pearl, alongside Mailchimp, which provides an integrated email marketing service. It enables them to have a better understanding of their customer database, including their behaviours and buying habits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It means that the company can personalise its messages. &quot;We send emails about our newest furniture collection only to customers who have demonstrated a prior interest in those types of items - and at that particular price point,&quot; says managing director, Lee Adams.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This makes our interactions more relevant and engaging.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By collecting data about its consumers, a company can use it to make decisions about what they might best respond to next. But this collection of data comes with concern and responsibility; according to a&nbsp;MediaCom&nbsp; study, from 2015 to 2017, people aged eight to 19 have become increasingly concerned about the amount of information that advertisers hold on them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Data treatment</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) also places a number of restrictions on how data is used - and empowers people to take control of their data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;With access to the right data, the sky's the limit in terms of how companies can personalise their interactions with customers,&quot; says Julian Saunders, chief executive and founder of data management and GDPR compliance company,&nbsp; PORT .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;However, with this opportunity comes a huge risk for businesses - feelings of intrusion, unease and loss of trust.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Saunders recommends that companies ensure that they have good data management. This means that businesses need technology in place that allows data to be error-free, in a readable format, and complete, centralised and easy to access. They should have processes in place to capture, modify and add data, and trained staff to understand data governance and legal requirements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is fundamental to ensure that hyper-personalisation is a positive experience for customers,&quot; he adds.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Everybody has the right to decide how much they disclose to the world. Until now, they have not had enough power to control how companies use their data. The UK's Data Protection Act dates to 1998, which for today's digital economy is a moment of pre-history. It was the year Google was founded, when only a fraction of British homes had an internet connection. Since then there has been an explosion in web use, and the creation and sharing of billions of pieces of data.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We were reminded once again this month how valuable data are, when Equifax disclosed a major cyber attack. At Cifas, the fraud prevention organisation that I chair, we see the price of bad data management every day. In the first six months of this year, there were 89,000 cases of identity fraud reported to us - a record number. The new Data Protection Bill that is due imminently will not automatically prevent these breaches, but will ensure the UK from next May complies with the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This will update the law, help public understanding and deter companies from neglecting data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 1998 Act established eight principles that govern how consumers' personal data, such as their phone number and email address, are processed. This includes that they must have been obtained fairly, they are accurate and they are held securely. It gives consumers the right to discover what personal data an organisation holds on them. These rules were updated in 2003 to give added protections around unsolicited direct marketing. The biggest change under the new regulations is that consumers gain much more clarity about the &quot;right to be forgotten&quot;. This is the ability to ask Facebook, Amazon and others to delete all the data they carry on you. It is the last thing many daily Facebook users would want, because they regard the service as a record of their lives. This new law, however, applies to any company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a right to ask, not an absolute right to delete everything. Still, the conditions are pretty broad. It applies when the data are no longer necessary in relation to the purpose for which they was originally collected. It applies when there is no legitimate interest for continuing to process the data, and it applies when consent is withdrawn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These rules are bold but lawyers are still working through the detail. I suspect how much is ultimately erased will only be clarified in court. The hope is that consumers will take greater interest in who knows what about them. The &pound;10 fee for information requests is being removed and every organisation must disclose what they know within a month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of the headlines about GDPR have focused on the cost to businesses if they fail. Data breaches including cyber attacks where companies are found wanting could be punished with fines of up to &pound;17m or 4pc of global turnover, whichever is higher. Under the existing regime, the maximum fine is &pound;500,000. Many small businesses are only now becoming aware of the work they will have to do to prepare for the new rules. The biggest challenge for companies will be to demonstrate that users understand what they are signing up for. A simple tick in the box is no longer enough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Data lie at the heart of many industries where the UK excels. Companies have used the information they have to innovate and tweak their offering. On the other hand, the massive expansion of personal data collection and storage by businesses has brought much greater scrutiny. Business leaders must accept this new reality and prepare now for GDPR.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     A worrying number of UK charities are yet to take any steps to prepare for the new UK law on data protection. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our survey (pdf) of more than 300 UK charities shows that most are taking action to prepare for the new general data protection regulation (GDPR), which comes into effect in May 2018, with major new requirements for how organisations process personal data. Steps already taken include training and recruiting staff; discussing data protection with their board; reviewing and updating privacy policies; and undertaking audits. This all shows that charities are taking seriously the need to reach the right standards for data protection.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  GDPR: how charities should prepare for data protection changes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, and not surprisingly, some organisations are finding it a challenge to get ready for these new legal changes. A fifth of respondents - 22% - said they had not yet taken any steps to get ready for GDPR. The vast majority of those organisations are smaller charities, with a turnover of under &pound;1m. But compliance and GDPR is not optional - so we need to ensure that everyone in the charity sector is ready. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The biggest challenge reported in our survey, cited by 72% of respondents, is a lack of clear guidance. The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has not yet published its final guidance on consent, but the law is written and final and the commissioner has put out a  range of resources for all organisations to think about the new law. There is also guidance from a range of organisations including ourselves, the Fundraising Regulator, and others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, we also believe there is a need for government action. That's why we've written to the digital minister, Matt Hancock, asking him to work with charities, regulators and sector bodies on a new strategic intervention to help the sector prepare for these changes. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As part of this, and based on the responses to our survey, we would like to see a targeted grant scheme set up to support charities who need to update their databases. We also want to see a coordinated campaign to raise awareness across the sector about the changes and guidance on offer. While the government already provides limited but very welcome support in building fundraising skills and capacity through the provision of subsidised training programmes, this should be complemented with an additional programme on data protection, and a hotline for charities with advice and information. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We know money is tight; if direct funding is not available, the government should use its convening power to identify and coordinate funding bodies that could support charities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  'This has to work': last chance for charities to clean up fundraising | David Brindle</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meeting the new requirements in data protection will affect all charities and it is the right thing to do for charity service users, volunteers and supporters. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But our research shows that for some there is still a long way to go before the charity sector as a whole is fully prepared. With May 2018 getting ever closer, the time for action is now. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the real world, asking someone out is sometimes fraught with awkwardness and tinged with the prospect of possible humiliation. One of the successes of the dating app Tinder was that it revealed only that a user liked another when the feeling was mutual. The wealth of information that such software requests may help to home in on the perfect match, but it also raises important questions over how the data is stored and what rights one has over it. Very little, if the case we reported earlier this week is anything to go by. In that story it took months for a journalist to extract her Tinder data. More than 800 pages of her most intimate life details - volunteered when using the dating app - tumbled out.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a world where personal data is increasingly shared and manipulated, there is an increasing risk that it might leak. The European Union, to its credit, understands that individuals might object to the way a tech company deals with their personal data. The EU's general data protection regulation (GDPR) sensibly attempts to strengthen a user's control over their data: in certain instances, companies are required to get explicit consent for how they use data. Fines for violations will be steep: up to (EURO)20m (&pound;17.5m). It also grants users access to their personal data. This is important: as our story points out, Tinder shares personal information with other tech giants which then use it to build a picture about users.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The personal data affects who you see first on Tinder but it can also be used to decide what job offers you have access to, or how much you will pay for car insurance. We found that Tinder only disclosed what it wanted to. Crucially, the company did not say how &quot;attractive&quot; the reporter had been rated - nor explained how this metric had been calculated. The Silicon Valley firm argued that as the data was always in the US, it had no legal duty to give her anything. This is wrong morally, if not in law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In effect, US big tech is engaging in jurisdictional arbitrage - taking advantage of the discrepancies between competing regulatory systems - to shelter what it does with personal data from oversight. US firms are not processing data in Europe for fear of falling under stricter EU regulations - something that became obvious after Google found itself liable for data-handling in Spain, a case that led to the landmark &quot; right to be forgotten &quot; ruling. The GDPR is supposed to level up protections; but one of Donald Trump's first acts was to say he would give non-US citizens less data protection than US ones despite previous assurances from Washington. The result is the growth of a US-centred tech economy where sensitive data is shared with little accountability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the case that the Guardian highlighted it took a lawyer, a technologist and a reporter to pierce the corporate veil and work out where personal data was processed. It's a global issue: Russia has told Facebook it would block access to the social network unless it stores the personal data of Russian citizens on its soil. Britain's new data bill, supposed to incorporate the GDPR, looks badly drafted. A concern is that UK regulators will simply take tech giants at their word. We are heading to a society where personal data is ever more influential. But its collection, storage and aggregation remains opaque. Shielding it impinges on people's right to make decisions for themselves and ultimately restricts their&nbsp;individualism.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scottish business groups have warned that companies are unprepared for radical changes in data protection law and risk heavy fines when the regulations come into force in seven months' time.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) becomes law in May and will force businesses to adopt stricter standards for dealing with customer and employee data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It includes a &quot;right to be forgotten&quot; under which consumer data can be erased. The definition of personal data is also extended to include internet protocol (IP) addresses, which can identify a phone or computer, and cookies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, the rules require companies to report all data breaches to the information commissioner within 72 hours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gordon Henderson of the Federation of Small Businesses Scotland (FSB) said many small business owners either did not know what GDPR was, or were unaware of the scope of the changes. He said: &quot;It will be a real challenge for firms to get ready for next year's legal deadline.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A report by Edinburgh law firm Brodies, carried out in conjunction with Ipsos Mori, said one in four organisations were unaware of GDPR, and that nearly half had not taken basic steps to prepare for its implementation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Watt, head of the Institute of Directors (IoD) in Scotland, said companies needed &quot;to wake up now&quot; to the implications of GDPR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Groups that fail to comply face significant fines with penalties for serious breaches of up to &pound;20m or 4% of worldwide turnover, whichever is greater.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin Sloan, partner with Brodies, said: &quot;GDPR applies to any organisation that handles personal data. Contrary to some suggestions, there is no exemption for small businesses.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added that companies that were not ready for GDPR risked regulatory investigations. He said: &quot;The information commissioner's Office isn't going to start knocking on everyone's door on May 26, but it has made it clear that it does not intend to delay investigating reports of alleged non-compliance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The FSB and other business groups, including the CBI and IoD, have published guidance on the regulations and the changes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oscar Wilde famously said: &quot;Ambition is the last refuge of the failure.&quot; So it's no coincidence that first minister Nicola Sturgeon, having had to abandon the traditional scoundrel's refuge of patriotism as our economy unravelled, is now desperately seeking a new bolthole in ambition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unveiling the SNP's programme for government, A Nation With Ambition, last week, Sturgeon said: 'The programme I have set out today, the policies and the legislation, is fresh, it is bold and it is ambitious.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Problem is, it isn't any of those things. A Nation With Ambition is the usual long on rhetoric, short on detail, ill-thoughtout policies we have been fed for the past decade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The SNP has had 10 years in charge with little to show for it beyond a dog's dinner of a property tax, cardboard baby boxes, and Trump-style put-downs when critics of its serial mismanagement of our economy are attacked for &quot;talking Scotland down&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problem with all this big picture ambition is that it's missing the brushstrokes. That's the day job bit, Nicola, turning ambition into practical measures and implementing them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, Sturgeon announced she would publish a series of &quot;evidencebased&quot; papers to make the case for enhanced powers in key policy areas, most notably immigration. It's a year since Sturgeon called for immigration to be devolved. It's also almost a year since I offered a blueprint for how a devolved immigration policy could work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why on earth does the first minister need to commission a policy paper? Her government has had ample time to formulate proposals and put them to Westminster, and, if it had any real ambition, it would have done so by now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What A Nation With Ambition really offers is old wine in new bottles. All the usual suspects are there, more promises to boost research and development, plans to create a Scottish investment bank - yes, that one again, and yet another &quot;strategic board&quot; for enterprise and skills. On top of all that Scotland will be free of all petrol and diesel cars within the next 15 years, construct 50,000 affordable homes, scrap the public sector pay cap, and examine the case for the so-called citizens annual income.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You could be forgiven for thinking Scotland didn't have a (nominal) deficit of &pound;13.3bn, 8.3% of our GDP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But fear not, the first minister, having already soaked businesses and made Scotland the most highly taxed part of the UK, plans to raise taxes even higher. Of course, we don't know how much taxes will increase because, along with being laughably illogical, A Nation With Ambition is also bereft of costings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For instance, the shift to electric cars will cost billions of pounds. The timeline outlined by the first minister would also require the construction of new nuclear plants or gas-fired power stations to generate energy for them. The Scottish government is opposed to both.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While many welcome the Scottish government's plans to cut the amount of plastic waste, the decision to impose a deposit on bottles will, according to the Scottish Retail Consortium, hit retailers to the tune of &pound;41m in implementation costs and could put small traders out of business. Surely it would be simpler to increase the number of kerbside recycling points rather than impose onerous regulations on corner shops? A Nation With Ambition is testimony to a decade of the Scottish government's economic failures. In the week it was unveiled, two weeks after this newspaper revealed that the Scottish government's &pound;500m growth fund for business had failed to support a single Scottish business, Edinburgh tech company Payfont collapsed into administration. Payfont chief executive David Lanc's words are a stark reminder of the chasm between the Scottish government's ambition and its actions. He said: &quot;If we had been in Silicon Valley life might be different, but being in Edinburgh, there remains a challenge in funding of hightech companies that need time to generate global interest.&quot; Mind the www.gap.Be prepared for a digital future About 150 people attended the FutureScot Digital Cities seminars, in Dundee and Edinburgh last week. Sponsored by The Sunday Times Scotland and Canongate, the seminars address the issues facing businesses and public sector bodies as the digitisation of our economy accelerates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A key theme so far is the number of businesses unprepared for the general data protection regulation (GDPR), which comes into force in eight months. GDPR will require businesses to adopt stricter standards for dealing with customer data. Failure to adhere will leave companies open to fines of up to 4% of annual turnover or &pound;18m - whichever is higher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One attendee sheepishly explained his ignorance thus: &quot;My primary tech adviser is my teenage son. He's great at sorting out our software, but doesn't know much about the law, he's busy with his Highers.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The American credit ratings giant at the heart of a cyber-attack affecting as many as 44m Britons would potentially face a &pound;95m fine for mishandling data under new European online privacy laws.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two days ago, Equifax revealed that hackers had infiltrated its computer system, potentially compromising the personal information of 143m Americans. It is one of the biggest breaches in history, and could prove more financially damaging than the attack on 1bn Yahoo user accounts last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The revelation sparked fears that millions of British citizens may also have had their personal data stolen, putting them at risk of identity theft.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Equifax, which is listed in New York with a $15bn (&pound;11.4bn) market value, holds data on 44m Britons and works for numerous companies, including BT and British Gas, owned by Centrica. Yesterday the FTSE 100 giants said they were monitoring the situation closely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Analysts said the credit ratings agency could have been subject to a heavy fine had the European Union's new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) already been in place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tough new rules covering how companies collect, share and store information on EU citizens are due to be introduced in May. Businesses will have to ask for explicit consent before storing and using information, and will be obliged to identify and report security breaches within 72 hours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The penalties for non-compliance will be heavy. Brussels will be able to fine companies as much as 4% of their global turnover. &quot;Had this cyber-attack occurred after next May, the requirements of the GDPR would be relevant [as] it took Equifax over a month to report the breach,&quot; said Citi bank analysts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year, the Atlanta-based company generated sales of $3.1bn, suggesting a maximum penalty equivalent to &pound;95m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This weekend, Equifax is fighting to salvage its reputation, and fend off potentially crippling litigation. It is already the target of class-action lawsuits in America. One of the lawyers involved said the company could be facing $70bn in claims. Eric Schneiderman, the New York attorney general, has opened an investigation into the breach, which is considered to be substantially more serious than the Yahoo attack because Equifax holds more sensitive personal details than the online search and email giant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cyber-thieves have reportedly procured names, addresses, social security numbers and dates of birth for millions of Americans from the agency's database. Experts said that could be enough for a criminal to set up a bank or credit card account in a victim's name.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BT said: &quot;Like many companies in the UK, we use Equifax services. We are working on establishing whether this breach has any impact on those services.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sources said British Gas keeps its customers' credit card and bank details in an encrypted database and did not share the data with third parties.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Small businesses and self-employed people are big targets for hackers, and the financial implications can be crippling. Gone are the days of thinking &quot;It'll never happen to us&quot;. A total of 61% of all data breaches this year occurred in businesses with fewer than 1,000 employees, according to the Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report. Estimates vary on how much a breach truly costs, but it can often be millions of pounds. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Cyber security takes centre stage in the age of Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What's more, new European regulation aimed at protecting personal data (GDPR) comes into force next year, and could result in fines of between 2% and 4% of annual turnover, or (EURO)20m (&pound;18m), whichever is greater. Not only have hacks increased in frequency, but the impact on SMEs is getting much bigger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But where do you begin? Many SMEs feel that being as secure as a big business is impossible. Corporations have large budgets, chief security officers and entire teams dedicated to cybersecurity. This perception stems from the impression that hacks are vastly complicated, and rely on a tireless horde of highly skilled attackers. Most hacks aren't like that. The majority depend on poor passwords and a lack of awareness of what a hacker actually needs to compromise your systems - a simple phishing email or a leaked password and they're in. It's that simple.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Educating yourself and your staff is the only solution. Hackers always look for soft targets, so start with the basics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   1 Get a strong password                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A total of 80% of hacking-related breaches use either stolen passwords and/or weak or guessable passwords. Getting a strong password is the bare minimum. What's more, it's easier than you think. A lot of people don't know that you can use spaces in your passwords, for example: &quot;horse mug table&quot; is much a much better password than &quot;Horse123&quot;. Test out how long yours would currently take for your password to be hacked here:  https://howsecureismypassword.net/</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   2 Then make your password unique                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having a single strong password doesn't count for much if that password then gets leaked. We've seen massive, trusted companies like LinkedIn and Yahoo leak millions of passwords over the last few years, which opens the door to wide-ranging cyber attacks. Password managers like LastPass and OnePassword help you generate and keep track of unique and strong passwords.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   3 Know what to look out for with phishing                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hackers are constantly sending &quot;phishing&quot; emails, trying to get you to click on their website so that they can install malware or convince you to give them your password. Understanding what a hacker is trying to do and what to look out for is key. Poor syntax, incorrect spelling, or email addresses and links that include a lot of full stops (for example, amazon.getcode.tickets.phishingattack.com ) are all key warning signs to look out for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   4 Understand the information you're already giving away                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Phishing attacks rely on the amount of information we share about ourselves online. Famously the hackers behind the celebrity iCloud leak in 2014 used information they'd gained from public posts to guess the answers to user's secret questions. If your secret question is &quot;The city I was born in&quot; and you post that information on Facebook, then hackers have an easy way into your account.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   5 Pay attention to web page urls                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When you see &quot;http&quot; in a web page url that means your communication with that page is unencrypted. Any communication could be easily read by a hacker waiting on that page; &quot;http&quot; is a warning sign to look out for if you ever think you might have stumbled onto a phishing or generally suspect website. If you're ever entering sensitive information like credit card numbers or personal details, make sure the website has &quot;https&quot; in the website url. That way you're more secure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   6 Update your software                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Software is updated for a reason. Usually companies like Microsoft or Apple will discover a vulnerability that might let hackers in, fix it, then offer an update. Always take them up on it. We saw with the WanaCry attack earlier this year what happens when organisations don't install patches (updates bringing computer systems to the most up-to-date version) and security updates. Unpatched vulnerabilities offer gaps into your systems that hackers use to install malware and ransomware, or to just gain control of your systems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   7 Encrypt everything                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Should a breach happen, you want to make sure whatever information hackers get their hands on is, at the very least, difficult for them to understand. Encrypting your hard drives and databases with a modern algorithm like AES256 is a key defensive tool to protect your data in the event of a breach. It's quick and easy to do. For more info you can check out this post by FreeCodeCamp to do it in under an hour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Knowledge is the key to cybersecurity, but it's important to think about the underlying structure of your business and the way it handles data more broadly. Organisation-wide controls and data-protection policies help define sound technological defence, and ensure you know how to respond in the event of a breach. Just remember that industry standards like an ISO27001 certification and SOCII are beneficial, but only when combined with education and good user behaviour.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The number of fines handed out for breaking UK data protection laws almost doubled last year, making Britain one of the most active regions for regulatory enforcement across Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to figures from the UK's Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) analysed by professional services firm PwC, fines for data protection breaches hit over &pound;3.2m in 2016, putting the UK on par with Italy, where fines totaled &pound;3.3m, but dramatically below the US where fines of approximately $250m (&pound;195m) were served.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mention the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which takes effect next May, and invariably eyes glaze over. Not too surprising, given that the title of this EU regulation is lamentably boring. Nonetheless GDPR is potentially a game-changer and requires compliance, regardless of where we might be next spring en route to Brexit. Hats off, then, to Lewis Silkin, whose public education video is commendably lively, with slick and amusing graphics that take you through the &quot;eleven things you must do to prepare for GDPR&quot;. It grabs your attention by warning of the enormous fine threatened for those who are unprepared (up to (EURO)20 million or 4 per cent of annual turnover). Eleven Things is guaranteed to stir you into action.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FIRMS that keep or process customers  personal information are being urged to act now to avoid steep fines under tough new EU data laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With nine months to go until the major shake-up of information governance laws, Dr Adam Marshall, director-general of the British Chambers of Commerce, which has warned smaller firms not to leave preparations  until the 11th hour , said:  This is a big change to the way that companies have to handle data and not knowing that the change is coming is not an excuse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We all need to get ready for this and make sure our data handling procedures are compliant. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The General Data Protection Regulation, which includes the  right to be forgotten , comes into effect on May 25. It means businesses could be liable for fines of up to <SPAN style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&#8218;</SPAN>&not;20 million (&pound;18.4[0/00]million) or four per cent of their turnover if they breach the rules. The Data Protection Bill announced in the Queen s Speech last month will implement GDPR into UK law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marshall said:  This [preparation] is crucial, not just for trading at home, but in future for trading with EU countries. The flows of data between us and the EU are very big and we wouldn t want to see any UK company losing access to customers or markets in Europe because it wasn t following the correct data handling procedures. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The BCC has recommended businesses review what personal data their firm holds, where it came from and who it is shared with. Firms should also review how they seek, obtain and record consent from individuals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said:  This isn t just about spam, this is about data that one might hold about customers and how it s protected on your servers, for example. Any business with a database should be thinking about it. Businesses that bill their customers should think about how they handle that billing information to make sure it s secure, for example.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is not and should not be any place to hide for a business that is wilfully trying to get around the law, because that undercuts other firms who are doing everything in their power to comply with it. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mike Cherry, chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said:  There is a clear danger that companies could inadvertently face a fine.  The FSB said the danger comes from the lack of awareness some small businesses have regarding the changes. It warned some do not know that the changes will relate to their business and will not be making preparations needed to comply with the new regulations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It said, giving the example of a gardening start-up that wanted to advertise services locally via email, the changes around consent would have a huge impact on a small business without a human resources or data protection officer. The business will not be able to email people unless they have given consent and if a person asks for their personal details to be deleted, this must be done in 72 hours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The FSB said fining should be a  last resort .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, bulk SMS provider Voodoo SMS surveyed consumers and businesses and found 75 per cent of respondents would not opt in to receiving marketing communications from online retailers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Managing director Gareth Davies said:  Businesses  customer contacts are unlikely to opt in to future marketing, a prerequisite of GDPR, and smaller firms are unaware of what to do to prepare for changes. Our concern is especially for small businesses without the expertise, resources and awareness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There s no grace period, no oewe ll be relaxed for the first couple of months. We ve got customers such as sports nutrition maker Myprotein doing massive turnover with hundreds of thousands of customers, and they started as one-man bands. They will all be affected and need to change their website, their privacy policy and their data retention policies. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Britain will seek to remain &quot;fully involved&quot; in shaping EU data protection regulations after Brexit in a hugely ambitious attempt to retain the status quo environment for businesses, the government has announced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plan, which was set out in a position paper from the Department for Exiting the EU, was welcomed by tech industry chiefs, although they quickly warned it would not be easy or straightforward to accomplish.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The question of how both business and government will maintain legal cross-border data exchanges after Brexit remains one of the most pressing of the Brexit talks, with data flows the lifeblood of both trade and security ties.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 13-page position paper argues that the UK will depart the EU with rules on data-sharing at an &quot;unprecedented point of alignment&quot;, and will seek an early determination from the European side that those flows will be maintained unimpeded immediately after Brexit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   How long until Britain leaves the EU?                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Subsequently, the UK will seek to build a new, bespoked UK-EU model &quot;which could build on&quot; the existing model in which the European Commission grants &quot;adequacy&quot; status to non-EU countries which it has determined comply with EU data protection standards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new model would allow the UK's data authority, the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) to be &quot;fully involved in future EU regulatory dialogue&quot;, with an &quot;ongoing role&quot; for the ICO with the existing network of EU data protection authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government has conceded that no other non-EU country has such a role and that such an arrangement would be unique and unprecedented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Antony Walker, deputy director Tech UK which represents more than 1,000 UK-based tech firms, welcomed the ambition of the UK proposals, but urged more detail from government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What the government says it wants to achieve is positive, but we urgently need more detail on how we get there, because it won't be easy or straightforward - although it is not impossible,&quot; he told The Telegraph. &quot;There really is a mutual interest to getting a solution to these issues.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Businesses hoping for a regulatory arbitrage on EU data rules after Brexit will be disappointed, with the UK government making clear that it is seeking no additional privileges for the UK after its departure from the EU.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead the British government believes it can use its &quot;unique&quot; alignment with the EU at the point of Brexit to win a seamless deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, EU sources have cautioned that even though the UK will this year absorb the EU's new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) into UK law, a determination of &quot;adequacy&quot; after Brexit is not guaranteed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a non-EU country, any such designation will have to take into account the UK's security establishment which has sweeping powers under the new 2016 Investigatory Powers Act that one senior EU official has told The Telegraph &quot;harks back to the 1940s.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Robert Madelin of Fipra International, a policy adviser who was the director-general of the EU's digital directorate DG Connect from 2010-2015, said the question of adequacy and surveillance were a &quot;real issue&quot; both politically and for the European Court of Justice.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The difficulty, at UK as well as EU level, is the proportionality of data use, the avoidance of all-encompassing data acquisition (a default data dragnet) and how to allow effective oversight by courts or regulators while respecting national security,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tech industry leaders have also warned that the UK should not take &quot;adequacy&quot; for granted, citing the experience of the United States that had to work extremely hard to build its Privacy Shield data-sharing agreement with the EU after a previous agreement, Safe Harbour, was struck down by the European Court of Justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liz Fitzsimons, a partner in privacy and information law at Eversheds Sutherland said the UK paper was &quot;ambitious&quot; and represented a welcome change of tone, but warned that difficult issues remained unresolved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She cited the recent rejection by the ECJ of&nbsp;a proposed passenger name record (PNR) database with Canada as an illustration&nbsp;that core issues over the balance between security and privacy was still highly problematic in Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However she added that failure to strike a deal would hit EU27 businesses hardest, as happened when the ECJ struck down the US-EU Safe Harbour agreement.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Absent of a deal, the bulk of the costs to ensure lawful data transfers will hit EU27-based businesses which are likely to continue to trade and share data across borders regardless,&quot; she warned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   Brexit negotiations | UK position papers                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UK government, which has said it wishes to retain links with Europol, believes that Britain's unique place in the EU security apparatus, where UK security services have some of the best information in Europe, will provide an effective lever to reach a deal with the EU.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also believes that the fact that 43pc&nbsp;of all large EU digital companies are started in the UK will further incentivise the EU into cutting a deal, with the paper warning that an disruption to EU-UK data flows will be &quot;economically costly&quot; both sides.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However a potential breakdown in talks - and a desire among some member states, like France, to capture some of that UK tech market as a by-product of Brexit - point to the potential for fraught negotiations ahead, industry experts warn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the event of a total breakdown, the government acknowledge that businesses will have to fall back on so-called &quot;standard contract clauses&quot; that undertake to follow EU data privacy rules - a situation that business has warned would be hugely costly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is crucial that businesses are not left relying on standard contract clauses to deal with managing data flows after Brexit,&quot; said Allie Renison, head of EU and Trade Policy at the Institute of Directors. &quot;It is the responsibility of the UK and the EU to come to an agreement on this, rather than transferring the onus of compliance requirements onto companies.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Government data protection paper published today is a welcome step in the right direction, setting out the vital need for the UK to remain a global leader on data protection by promoting both the flow of data internationally and high levels of data protection rules.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These issues may not dominate headlines or stir public debate relative to immigration or sovereignty, but are nonetheless key to a prosperous future outside the EU. However, they have remained out-of-sight and out-of-mind for too long when the stakes couldn't be higher. Not only for our future competitiveness outside the EU, but for our national security.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the paper highlights, the UK is a leading player in global data flows, accounting for 11.5 per cent of cross-border data flows, and a fast-growing digital economy - worth &pound;118 billion in 2015.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Queen Elizabeth II uses a computer to upload a video to the Royal Channel on You Tube video alongside co-founder of You Tube Chad Hurley (centre) and Nikesh Arora (left), President of Google Europe, Middle East and Africa during a visit to the company's London &nbsp;headquarters, in Buckingham Palace RoadCredit:      Adrian Dennis&nbsp;/PA     </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Staggering, really - to think it was just over four decades ago when Queen Elizabeth II was one of the first heads of state to transmit real-time electronic data over national borders, sending an email under the username &quot;HME2.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Or that global cross-border data flows were nascent just 15 years ago and now account for $2.8 trillion of the $7.8 trillion total flows of goods, services, finance, people and data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But at present, 75 per cent of current data flows are with EU countries. Therefore, it must be a red-line early on in negotiations that we recognise each other's data protection frameworks from the point of exit. This must be before negotiating a new agreement that allows us the freedom to trade freely with new and fast-growing economies around the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second, and less-explored, issue raised in this paper is the potential for the UK to be a global pioneer of digital innovation, just as Queen Elizabeth II was a pioneer of the internet back in 1976.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There can be no doubt; the exponential growth witnessed affects us all - circulating ideas, content and new innovations to all corners of the globe. At the same time, it has stoked the threat of cyber-attacks, data breaches and risks to national security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                             BoE: Brexit uncertainty puts 'speed limit' on UK economy                         01:54</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If we get the next few years right, the UK could set the gold standard for both allowing digital innovation to thrive, while appropriately balancing online responsibility and security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is no easy task, but it is vital if we are to move away from the protectionist mindset of the EU and attract new global opportunities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first test for the Government will be the upcoming Data Protection Bill this September, which needs to set out how the UK will handle the derogations under the new EU General Data Protection Regime (GDPR), which will apply to all EU Member States from May 2018 and updates the 1995 Data Directive (from the days of dial-up internet connections). It will also set out how the UK will implement the Police and Criminal Justice&nbsp;Directive on data processing for law enforcement, which governs how data should be processed for law enforcement purposes covering both controllers (e.g. the police) and processors (e.g. a startup doing smart data analytics on behalf of the police). A new framework for data processing for national security purposes will also be set out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No easy task, especially as the GDPR could have a significant impact on our most innovative fast-growth startups, who face the highest resource implications as they lack the in-house capabilities to adapt. Especially as the last Data Protection Act was passed way back in 1998, before the days of even Google and Facebook.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At this time of intense upheaval, the Government must avoid any moves towards digital protectionism in the name of &quot;robust safeguards.&quot; Now is not the time to create self-imposed digital barriers, but to do all that is possible to create a regulatory landscape that encourages growth, innovation and scale. We led the way before. We can do it again today.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Naughton</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">OPINION; Version:1</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">835 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Next year, 25 May looks like being a significant date. That's because it's the day that the European Union's general data protection regulation (GDPR) comes into force. This may not seem like a big deal to you, but it's a date that is already keeping many corporate executives awake at night. And for those who are still sleeping soundly, perhaps it would be worth checking that their organisations are ready for what's coming down the line.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  UK citizens to get more rights over personal data under new laws</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First things first. Unlike much of the legislation that emerges from Brussels, the GDPR is a regulation rather than a directive. This means that it becomes law in all EU countries at the same time; a directive, in contrast, allows each country to decide how its requirements are to be incorporated in national laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Second, the purpose of the new regulation is to strengthen and rationalise data protection for all individuals within the EU. It also covers the export of personal data to outside the bloc. Its aims are to give control back to EU residents over their personal data and to simplify the regulatory environment for international business by unifying regulation, so that instead of having to deal with a range of data-protection issues in different jurisdictions, companies will effectively be able to obtain a &quot;passport&quot; for the entire region, much as financial services firms have been able to acquire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given that the use, abuse and exploitation of personal data has become the core business of the internet, anything that affects this is going to be a big deal. The GDPR extends EU data-protection law to all foreign companies that process the data of EU residents. So even if a company has no premises or presence within the EU, if it processes EU data it will be bound by the regulation. And the penalties for non-compliance or infringement are eye-watering, even by internet standards: fines up to (EURO)20m and/or 4% of global turnover.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Advertising Age concludes that the new regulation will 'rip the global digital ecosystem apart'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GDPR applies both to data &quot;controllers&quot; (who determine how and why personal data is processed) and &quot;processors&quot; (who handle the data on the controller's behalf). The obligations on controllers are broadly similar to those imposed by current data-protection law. But if you're a processor, then the regulation imposes specific legal obligations on you to maintain records of personal data and processing activities and you will have significantly more legal liability if you are responsible for a data breach. And any breach, no matter how small, has to be reported to the authorities within 72 hours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More significantly, the GDPR extends the concept of &quot;personal data&quot; to bring it into line with the online world. The regulation stipulates, for example, that an online identifier, such as a device's IP address, can now be personal data. So next year, a wide range of identifiers that had hitherto lain outside the law will be regarded as personal data, reflecting changes in technology and the way organisations collect information about people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The regulation gives important new rights to citizens over the use of their personal information. They have the right, for example, to contest and fight decisions that have been made about them by algorithms processing their data. Valid consent has to be explicitly obtained for any data collected and for the uses to which it will be put. Consent for children's data must be given by parents or guardians and data controllers must be able to prove that consent has been obtained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Citizens will now have the right to request the deletion of personal information related to them - and companies will have to be able to prove that the offending data has been properly wiped (which may be more difficult than it sounds ). And so on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For many traditional companies - the ones that keep HR records, customer lists, contact details etc - the GDPR will probably make little practical difference, except for more onerous compliance requirements. But for organisations that have hitherto operated outside the reach of data-protection law, for example the hidden multitudes of data-hucksters, trackers, data-auctioneers and ad-targeters that operate behind the facade of websites, social media and Google, the GDPR represents an existential threat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook and Google should be OK, because they claim to have the &quot;consent&quot; of their users. But the data-broking crowd do not have that consent. As Advertising Age puts it: &quot;Targeting and tracking companies will need to get user consent somehow. Everything that invisibly follows a user across the internet will, from May 2018, have to pop up and make itself known in order to seek express permission from individuals.&quot; The new regulation will, it concludes, &quot;rip the global digital ecosystem apart&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not before time, IMHO. In the meantime, three cheers for the EU. And - since you ask - the UK government has decided that the GDPR will apply here even after Brexit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">SMALL BUSINESS; Version:1</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1098 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What does the General Data Protection Regulation mean for me and my small business, how can I prepare for the new regulation and when should I start?&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Myron Jobson, of This is Money, says:&nbsp;The&nbsp;General Data Protection Regulation&nbsp;is a piece of legislation designed by the European Union to which every citizen in the 27 nation bloc must adhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a lot to this new legal framework but, put simply, it will introduce stricter rules on how firms and organisations handle and use our personal data.&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In particular, the new directive takes aim at how sensitive customer information is processed, stored and exchanged among businesses.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GDPR will also give more power to people over how their personal data is used and make it easier for them to access it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the more notable measures of the GDPR is the fabled 'right to be forgotten' which allows EU citizens to request for a company to delete the personal data they have on file provided there are no legitimate grounds for retaining it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The European Commission - which creates EU legislation - says it is all about protecting the privacy of individuals and not about erasing past events or restricting freedom of the press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It adds that&nbsp;some nine out of 10 EU citizens have expressed concern about mobile apps collecting their data without their consent, while seven out of 10 worry about the potential use that companies may make of the information disclosed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Data protection will be even stricter when it comes to handling personal data of children.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The idea is that they may be&nbsp;less aware of risks and consequences of dishing out sensitive information about themselves and should therefore be afforded to heightened protection compared to adults.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In short, GDPR is a biggie. It will have far-reaching consequences for your business and how you use customer data - even for those who haven't bought anything.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The directive is due to come into force from 25 May 2018. The UK's decision to leave the EU changes nothing. The British government has confirmed it has no intention of backtracking on these arrangements now.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bosses of firms both big and small should educate themselves on the changes and take the appropriate steps to ensure their enterprise is positioned to implement the changes ahead of time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We approached&nbsp;Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) -&nbsp;the watchdog responsible for guarding our personal information -and a data protection expert at business insurance firm Hiscox&nbsp;about the key considerations and the steps businesses should be taking now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garreth Cameron, group manager of Policy Directorate, at ICO&nbsp;, replies: If you're complying with the current data protection law, you'll be well on the way to complying with the GDPR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new legislation will apply to any organisation in the UK handling personal data from May 25 next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is an evolution of current data protection law that will require businesses to be more accountable for their use of personal information and give consumers more control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of the GDPR's main aims and principles are the same as those in the Data Protection Act. So if you're complying properly with the current law then most of your approach to compliance will remain valid under the GDPR and can be the starting point to build from.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However there are new elements and some significant enhancements, so you will have to do some things for the first time and some things differently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consumers will have more rights in areas such as being better informed about what businesses are doing with their data and having greater access and control over their data. For example, by having the right to access their data free of charge and to request data about them is erased.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is vital that organisations are prepared to comply but they can also prosper in the new regulatory landscape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those organisations which thrive in the changing environment will be the ones that look at the handling of personal information with a mindset that appreciates what citizens want and expect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This means moving away from looking at data protection as a compliance issue to making a commitment to managing data sensitively and ethically because it's just as much part of good business practice as honest pricing or good customer service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now is the time for businesses to act and the ICO is here to help them through this important change. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Stephen Ridley, cyber and data risks underwriter at Hiscox UK and Ireland, adds: GDPR affects businesses of all sizes - even SMEs - that hold personal information like names, addresses, HR records, customer lists and even online identifiers such as a computer's IP address.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are now under ten months to make sure you are compliant by the time it comes into effect on 25 May 2018, so in terms of when you should start, the answer is now. The key things to consider include:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>

<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Review the situation as it is at present - What personal data do you currently hold/process? How was it gathered? Where is it stored? What do you do with it?&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
</LI><LI CLASS="c10"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"><NOBR>&bull;</NOBR></SPAN></P>
<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Check the data consents that you have in place - You may have given 'opt out' options when you collected specific data (for example from customers), but these are invalidated by GDPR, so using this data for any purpose where consent is required could lead to prosecution. You may have to re-obtain consent from individuals where you are unable to demonstrate that they have given affirmative consent.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
</LI><LI CLASS="c10"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"><NOBR>&bull;</NOBR></SPAN></P>
<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Businesses will have an obligation to make individuals aware of their rights as part of the data collection process, so consider whether you need to update your privacy policies or T&amp;Cs. Review your supplier contracts, if you share data with them. The GDPR has some specific provisions which have to be included.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
</LI><LI CLASS="c10"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"><NOBR>&bull;</NOBR></SPAN></P>
<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Have a clear plan for what should happen in the event that you experience a data breach.&nbsp;Understand what data you hold counts as 'personal', where it's kept, who has access to it, your mechanisms for spotting a breach and who it should be reported to.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Non-compliance can have severe consequences, resulting in regulatory investigation and/or a fine.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The size of the fine could be up to 4 per cent of a company's global turnover (for the previous year) or (EURO)20million (&pound;18million) -whichever is the higher- for the most serious of breaches, or 2 per cent/ (EURO)10 million (&pound;9million) for administrative errors such as not completing - or even just not documenting - privacy impact assessments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although it would be very surprising if a small business was fined anywhere near these figures, the ICO has already demonstrated its willingness to impose financial penalties against SMEs, so it is better to be safe than sorry.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A new law, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), comes into force next May. It will have a big impact on the way many businesses can store, transfer and process personal data.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Breaking the GDPR could result in heavy penalties with the most serious violations potentially leading to fines of up to (EURO)20 million or 4% of turnover (whichever is greater). Matthew Pryke, a partner at law firm Hamlins, looks at what steps you can take to prepare now:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1 Make sure you do a thorough audit of the information you hold. Businesses are required to document the personal data held, where it came from and who the business shares its data with. Until a full audit has been undertaken it is difficult to address this requirement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2 Review how you seek, record and manage consents for use of data. Consents under the GDPR must be clear, unambiguous and freely given. &quot;Opt Outs&quot; will not do.an appropriate budget.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3  Allocate As with any business change, there are unavoidable costs. They'll include, for many organisations, the appointment of a Data Protection Officer. Without a budget and an employee responsible for this project you will find it hard to meet the various obligations required.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4 Review your privacy policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is inevitable the privacy policies and notices used by your business - whether as part of a website or on other media - will need to be reviewed and updated to reflect the changes required by the GDPR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once notices have been bought up to scratch, systems can then be put in place to ensure these privacy notices are effectively communicated to customers and other individuals whose data you hold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5 All businesses will be required to have the correct procedures in place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These will involve the detection, reporting and investigation of personal data breaches. This can include cyber attacks and other unauthorised disclosure of data to which many businesses are now subjected.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following the infamous row over chlorinated chicken, Trade Secretary Liam Fox accused the British media of &quot;obsessing over the detail of the very end stage of one sector of a potential free trade agreement&quot;. Yet obsessive level of detail at every stage and for every sector is exactly what we need, especially from the Government, if we are to successfully forge new trade agreements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New free trade arrangements with some of the world's fastest growing economies offer us huge post-Brexit opportunities, but the devil really is in the detail. This is particularly true for our fast-growth digital sector that does not adhere to a traditional trade model of goods vs. services, but generates significant economic trade value.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fast-growth digital sector represents 24 per cent of total UK exports and underpins the new era of digital globalisation, which has upended the entire concept of trade in recent years with the increase of cross-border data flows around the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a time when global goods grew by only 1.3 per cent in 2016 - the first time since 2001 that trade grew more slowly than GDP - global cross-border data flows now account for $2.8 trillion of the $7.8 trillion total global flows of goods, services, finance, people and data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   How long until Britain leaves the EU?                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UK is a world-leader here, accounting for more than 11 per cent of global cross-border data flows in 2015. By comparison, we accounted for 3.9 per cent of global GDP and less than one per cent of global population - and analysis shows that data will benefit the UK economy by up to &pound;241 billion between 2015 and 2020.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In short, we must put the ability to transfer data unhindered at the heart of these new free trade agreements. Liam Fox must view data flow as the bedrock from which to build upwards - but his job won't be straightforward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First, three-quarters of the UK's cross border data flows are currently to EU countries. UK and EU negotiators must ensure the unhindered flow of data with them after we exit the EU. Any disruption would severely hamper economic growth, industry and national security - both in the UK and in the EU member states in question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once we leave the EU, the UK will be classified as a 'third country' and need to go through a formal process to obtain an 'adequacy decision' from the European Commission. This will confirm the UK's domestic data protection rules are an equivalent standard of protection to that available within the EU.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                             The U.K.'s Digital Economy: It's About to Explode                         05:06</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the face of it this shouldn't be too complex. It is in the interests of both parties to do a deal - and the British Government has taken steps to align its data protection rules with the EU, by opting-in to the EU General Data Protection Regime (GDPR) and bringing in a new Data Protection Bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This sets out how the UK will handle the derogations under the GDPR, implement the EU directive on data processing for law enforcement (often overlooked) and states an ambition to have a framework for data processing for national security purposes. But this process has many potential pitfalls and complexities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One potential stumbling block is talk of potential trade agreements with the US - which&nbsp;must&nbsp;include data transfers. If these negotiations progress in advance of resolving adequacy with the European Commission, it won't land well in Brussels.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The challenge will be creating a deal that does not act as an impediment to building a close new partnership with the EU, between nations that have very different views on data protection. The EU and the US approach data protection from two vastly different philosophies and the GDPR includes specific controls on the transfer of personal data to non-EEA countries who are not officially recognised as providing an adequate level of protection. This includes the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Where the EU data protection regime puts individual data protection at its heart - a move mirrored by the UK in the upcoming Data Protection Bill - the Trump administration has moved to dismantle Obama's 2015 net neutrality regulations, which required internet providers to obtain customer permission before sharing their browsing history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump's chairman of the Federal Communications Commission,  Ajit Pai has called the rules &quot;heavy handed&quot; and argues that the rules limit innovation, especially for smaller providers and &quot;market forces are better than government rules&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The EU will pay close attention to our 'Privacy Shield' equivalent with the US, and be concerned that onward data-flows are not up to their standards, thus limiting room for manoeuvre and our negotiation powers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                             Tech Sector Takes Wild Ride Post-Election                         03:57</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is not to say the EU is an aspiration for the UK. The EU has struggled to keep up with the digital revolution and failed to strike its own agreement across the membership bloc on what form a Digital Single Market should take.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In truth, the bloc mentality of the EU has been holding back global digital trade advancements for its member states. Indeed, European negotiators failed to persuade the Japanese to accept their guarantees on freer flows of data, leaving this critical element abandoned for now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is not the route we want to go down as we forge our new way in the world. But maintaining open-data flows between the EU, UK and&nbsp;US, is a critical area of negotiations where the Government faces a diplomatic challenge to avoid a situation where the UK has to choose between the US or the EU.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New trade deals offer our digital economy exciting opportunities to accelerate its already incomparable growth rate. It is clearly an area where the UK can emerge as a global leader.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the diplomatic and regulatory challenges ahead may make chlorinated chicken seem like a paltry footnote if the Government doesn't urgently make data trade a priority of new trade deals.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If not, small overlooked details may quickly escalate and dramatically impact one of the UK's most successful and innovative sectors.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Westminster's empty, Theresa May's off hiking and Don't Tell the Bride's embroiled in a faking scandal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But that doesn't mean government has completely shut down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's been a slow drip-feed of good news coming from Whitehall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From banning rip-off card charges to protecting package holidays, these positive announcements have made some easy headlines for the government.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's just one hitch - they all have strong roots in policies from the supposedly terrible EU, which we're trying to leave.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In other words, we would have had to introduce major parts of these laws anyway before Brexit in March 2019.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Extra charges for paying by credit card outlawed - saving as much as 20% on flights, council fines and more</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sometimes this has been obvious if you're looking for it. But with one policy, the government didn't mention it at all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here are three EU policies this summer that have been dusted off, tweaked and boasted about afresh by the Tory government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Date: July 19</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Department: Treasury</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is it? Extra charges for paying by credit card will be outlawed from January 2018. It'll save Brits &pound;473million on extra charges for flights, online shopping, gig tickets and more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How was it announced? The Treasury issued a press release claiming &quot;ministers today acted to end these unfair fees&quot; and didn't mention the EU at all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So what's the EU link? The Second EU Payment Services Directive was already forcing governments to introduce a ban on certain types of surcharge by January 2018. The government simply decided to &quot;extend&quot; this ban to &quot;all retail payment instruments&quot;, its own documents say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Extra charges for paying by credit card outlawed - saving as much as 20% on flights, council fines and more</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Date: August 14</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Department: Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is it? Current protections on package holidays will be extended to those sold online; travellers will have to be given better information at the time they book; and the business you buy from will be responsible for the whole holiday, even if some aspects are provided by third parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How was it announced? The government issued a press release with the title &quot;Government launches proposals to better protect holidaymakers&quot;. The only reference to the EU was the final sentence: &quot;The European Package Travel Directive comes into force in July 2018.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So what's the EU link? That 'Package Travel Directive', which you can read here, contains everything in the government's announcement already. In other words, it's not really an announcement. Last night, only after prompting from the Mirror, a Business Department spokesman admitted there were no &quot;additional parts&quot; of the proposed law that weren't already laid down by the EU.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Date: August 8</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Department: Culture, Media and Sport</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is it? Bodies providing an &quot;essential service&quot; like airlines, utility firms and the NHS could face fines of up to &pound;17million if IT blunders or cyber-hacks lead to service failures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How was it announced? Of the three announcements here, this one was the most honest about its EU link. A press release openly said it was about &quot;how to implement the Network and Information Systems (NIS) Directive from May 2018&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So what's the EU link? The above Directive is a wide-ranging EU law on improving cyber-security. It says it will be up to EU member states to decide a level of &quot;penalties&quot; which are &quot;effective, proportionate and dissuasive&quot;. In other words, the general principle was from the EU and the exact rule drawn up by the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">British airlines and the NHS face tough fines if IT meltdowns affect the public under new EU law</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Date: August 7</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Department: Culture, Media and Sport</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is it? A new Data Protection Bill will bring in a string of measures including the 'right to be forgotten' and making it easier to withdraw consent for the use of personal data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How was it announced? In a press release with the boastful title &quot;Government to strengthen UK data protection law&quot; and a small mention of the EU Directive at the bottom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So what's the EU link? Many of the measures - including the right to be forgotten and changes to the law on consent - are almost word-for-word what's already in the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Everyone will be given sweeping new powers to see what tech companies know about them and have it deleted, under a new bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Data Protection Bill will make it far more easy for people to find out how companies are using their personal details, including their browsing history and even their DNA. And once they've seen it, it will also greatly increase the &quot;right to be forgotten&quot; - allowing people to make those companies delete that most personal of information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bill is intended partly to allow people to escape from their internethistory when they become an adult, since companies like Facebook and Google will have to scrub everything that they posted when they were a child.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Companies that won't comply could be fined millions of pounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As well as giving people far more power in how their information is handled, it will also make companies be more up front about how it is collected. Companies won't be able to trick their customers by using pre-selected tick boxes that opt into tracking, for instance, and people will instead have to give their explicit consent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The legislation will:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Allow people to ask for their personal data held by companies to be erased.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Enable parents and guardians to give consent for their child's data to be used.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Expand the definition of personal data to include IP addresses, internet cookies and DNA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Make it easier and free for individuals to require an organisation reveal the personal data it holds on them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Create new criminal offences to deter organisations from intentionally or recklessly creating situations where someone could be identified from anonymised data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The legislation will bring the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) into domestic law, helping Britain prepare for Brexit because it will mean the systems are aligned when the UK leaves the bloc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Information Commissioner's Office will be given significantly tougher powers, with the maximum fine it can levy being increased from &pound;0.5m to &pound;17 million, or 4% of a firm's global turnover.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bill, which was announced in the Queen's Speech, will be introduced in Parliament when MPs and peers return from the summer break in September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Digital Minister Matt Hancock said: &quot;Our measures are designed to support businesses in their use of data, and give consumers the confidence that their data is protected and those who misuse it will be held to account.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The new Data Protection Bill will give us one of the most robust, yet dynamic, set of data laws in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It will give people more control over their data, require more consent for its use, and prepare Britain for Brexit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have some of the best data science in the world and this new law will help it to thrive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham said: &quot;We are pleased the Government recognises the importance of data protection, its central role in increasing trust and confidence in the digital economy and the benefits the enhanced protections will bring to the public.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Julian David, chief executive of industry body techUK, said implementing the GDPR regulations in full &quot;puts the UK in a strong position to secure unhindered data flows once it has left the EU, and gives businesses the clarity they need about their new obligations&quot;.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UK government has announced plans to strengthen UK data protection law, giving citizens more control over their personal information - including what they share on social media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the newData Protection Bill, individuals will have the &quot;right to be forgotten&quot;, meaning they will be able to make websites like Facebook delete information - including content published in their childhood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Matt Hancock, Minister of State for Digital, said the measures are designed to &quot;give consumers the confidence that their data is protected and those who misuse it will be held to account&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If passed, the Data Protection Bill will bring British law into line with the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which will become enforceable from May 2018.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's what the new Data Protection Bill and &quot;right to be forgotten&quot; could mean for you:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you ticked a box that gave a company permission to use your personal information for marketing or targeted advertising, and have come to regret it, the new bill will allow you to withdraw your consent at any time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This should encourage companies to treat your information with respect, and not bombard you with unsolicited communications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook to be forced to delete your information on demand under new law</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you uploaded embarrassing photos to Facebook as a teenager, and now want them wiped from your record, the new bill will give you the power to do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You will also be able to force companies to delete your contact details and personal information from their databases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is important that the general public embraces this new freedom and recognises the value of personal data,&quot; said David Emm, principal security researcher, Kaspersky Lab.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is important that we on an individual level know what information is being kept and how it's being handled - which will also reduce the likelihood of it falling into the wrong hands.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Children are accessing the internet from an early age these days, so it's important their personal data is being protected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new bill will give parents and guardians direct control over where their child's data is used.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parents must stop kids using social media &quot;like junk food&quot;, says government's top child protection adviser</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If companies want to collect your personal data, they will have to gain your explicit consent - meaning you will have to proactively tick a box saying you agree.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That means default opt-in and pre-selected &quot;tick boxes&quot; will become a thing of the past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is not yet clear whether the same principle will be applied to the government's collection of citizens' personal data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It feels hypocritical for the government to be trumpeting these new data protection measures while at the same time being responsible for the Investigatory Powers Act, or Snoopers' Charter, that runs completely contrary to these proposals,&quot; said Simon Migliano, Head of Research atTop10VPN.com.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Will the Government have to ask 'explicit' permission to harvest your data? Will you be able to ask them to view or delete the data the Government holds on you? I doubt it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Consumers should not rely on the Government to look after their digital rights and data. Instead they should take responsibility for minimising their digital footprint through a combination of cautious, careful habits and technology.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook exec quit job and lives as a RECLUSE claiming machines 'destroy jobs' and will spark an 'ugly' revolution</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the digital, age the definition of personal data is not always clear, and the ways we share information online are constantly evolving.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new bill will expand the definition to cover the digital footprints you leave online without even realising - such as IP addresses and internet cookies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It will also include DNA - which means the biometric information you use to access digital service, such as fingerprints, facial recognition and iris scanning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The expansion of personal identifiable information to include IP addresses, DNA and cookies is going to be no easy task for businesses to identify and protect,&quot; said Bharat Mistry, principal security strategist at Trend Micro.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What's more, they'll need to have both an effective consent policy in place, and know exactly where this data is held should a consumer exercise their right to be forgotten.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And this doesn't just to apply to businesses themselves, but any third party partners that might be processing their customer data, meaning there are a lot of plates to spin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you use a lot of online services, it can be difficult to keep track of what information you have given to each company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bill will allow you to request a full breakdown of the information any given company holds on you.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This does provide some challenges for business in terms of getting their houses in order, but, ultimately, this now means that privacy needs to be at the core of their business strategies,&quot; said Mark Thompson, head of privacy advisory at KPMG.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instagram named worst social network for cyberbullying with two in five victims going on to develop anxiety</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you have lost trust in one online service provider and want to switch to another, the bill will make it easier to do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It will also make it easier to share information between two difference service providers, so you don't have to enter it all over again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If a company loses your personal information, you can often feel powerless to do anything about it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the terms of the bill, the Information Commissioner's Office will be given the power to issue higher fines of up to &pound;17 million pounds or 4% of global turnover, in cases of very serious data breaches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The measures should encourage companies to take data protection seriously, and help give users of online services peace of mind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All too often consumers suffer the consequences when company failures lead to their data being compromised, so the government must ensure they can easily get redress when data is lost,&quot; said Alex Neill, managing director of home products and services at Which?.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook and other social networks will be forced to delete information on demand under a proposed new law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It will give users the power to ask social networks to delete all the data they hold on them, including personal information, posts and photos.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And it bans websites from using 'opt out' tick boxes to approve data collection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Information Commissioner watchdog will be given the power to issue fines of up to &pound;17 million for companies who break the rules.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Data Protection Bill, being trailed by Digital minister Matt Hancock today, also writes the EU's General Data Protection Regulations into British Law - aligning our system with Europe's in the run up to Brexit .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other measures in the bill expand the definition of 'personal data' to include IP addresses and DNA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And it aims to make it easier - and free - to force an organisation to reveal the personal data it holds about individuals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Digital Minister Matt Hancock said: &quot;Our measures are designed to support businesses in their use of data, and give consumers the confidence that their data is protected and those who misuse it will be held to account.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The new Data Protection Bill will give us one of the most robust, yet dynamic, set of data laws in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parents must stop kids using social media &quot;like junk food&quot;, says government's top child protection adviser</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It will give people more control over their data, require more consent for its use, and prepare Britain for Brexit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have some of the best data science in the world and this new law will help it to thrive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham said: &quot;We are pleased the Government recognises the importance of data protection, its central role in increasing trust and confidence in the digital economy and the benefits the enhanced protections will bring to the public.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Julian David, chief executive of industry body techUK, said implementing the GDPR regulations in full &quot;puts the UK in a strong position to secure unhindered data flows once it has left the EU, and gives businesses the clarity they need about their new obligations&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bill has been toughened up since it was introduced in the Queen's Speech - it originally only set out to force companies to delete information on users up to the age of 18.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shadow culture secretary Tom Watson said: &quot;Labour's manifesto committed to allowing young people to remove content shared on the internet before they turned 18, so we're glad the Government is taking action on this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As we are leaving the EU it is more important than ever that we have a robust data protection framework fit for the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We'll be scrutinising the bill carefully to make sure it creates that future proof framework.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                                        &lt;table&gt;                                                                           </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - DCMS (@DCMS) August 7, 2017                                                                                  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Included in the reforms are a &quot;right to be forgotten&quot; that will allow individuals to ask companies including social media firms for their data to be erased.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   What are the new measures?                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Data Protection Bill proposes a package of new measures for consumers:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Right to be forgotten</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consumers will be able to ask businesses and organisations for access to their personal data and for it to be wiped, giving them more control over how their information is removed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This measure is part of the European General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR), but the UK law will extend this slightly by requiring social media companies to delete all of a person's posts from before they were under 18, if they ask for it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The requirement will be subject to some exemptions, but may cause a headache for businesses, some of whom may not have data stored in files or on analogue tapes, making it difficult to sort their data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Personal data</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The definition of personal data will be greatly expanded to reflect new types of data that were not covered by the 1998 regulations. They include IP addresses (used to identify a phone or computer visiting a website), internet cookies (data about your web browsing habits) and DNA. This follows concerns that internet browsing records are increasingly being used to target people.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Privacy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At present, many websites force visitors to opt out of being added to email and phone call lists by ticking boxes at the end of online forms. Consent for privacy policies,&nbsp;which web browsers never read, is often assumed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new laws will make consent explicit - people will have to opt in to being put on cold-calling lists and be aware that their&nbsp;information is&nbsp;being passed on to marketing companies. In practice, it should mean receiving fewer calls asking if you've been in a car accident that wasn't your fault.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Automated processing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is another law being taken over from GDPR, but its consequences are still yet to be seen. When individuals are &quot;profiled&quot; by an algorithm based on their personal data, such as an evaluation of their health, wealth or movements, individuals can demand this action is performed by a person, rather than a machine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Things such as insurance and job applications are increasingly relying on automation, so this will be of growing importance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Data portability</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consumers will be able to move data between companies should they wish to. For example, they will be able to easily move photos between cloud storage companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   New powers and criminal offences                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The data watchdog will be given new powers to enforce the rules. It will be able to levy fines of up to &pound;17m, or 4 per cent of a company's global turnover, for breaching the rules, well up from the current &pound;500,000 maximum for breaching the current Data Protection Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For a major company like Google, that could mean fines potentially worth billions of pounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There will also be two new criminal offences, which could have unlimited fines:</SPAN></P>

<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Re-identifying people from anonymous data:&nbsp;Data is often kept anonymous to respect people's privacy, but by piecing many of these bits together, it might be possible to identify an individual's browsing habits or credit card transactions. This will become a criminal offence.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Changing data: Organisations could also face criminal charges if they are found tampering with data that has been requested by an individual.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   Why are we doing this?                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Next May, the &nbsp;GDPR, a new set of cross-EU data rules, comes into force. The UK's existing data rules must be updated to match them so they are equivalent to the EU's laws after Brexit. This is to ensure that organisations can freely send data back and forth with Europe after we leave.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some reforms, such as the requirement that social media companies delete under-18 posts when asked, are extra to the GDPR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   Is it controversial?                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many experts have warned that businesses are totally unprepared for the new rules coming into force. Although fines are unlikely to all reach &pound;17m, companies may be stung before getting their houses in order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Campaigners have criticised the Government for not allowing privacy groups to make &quot;super complaints&quot; against companies, in the same way that consumer organisations can. These complaints were made an option under the GDPR but ministers have not taken it up. Privacy groups say consumers often find it difficult to understand complex data issues so campaigners should be able to act on their behalf.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The extent of the reforms are also unclear - important personal data such as health records or data of scientific importance may be protected, but at this stage&nbsp;it is unclear exactly what the exemptions may be.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DNA profiles and browsing histories are also to be included in a new definition of personal data, with companies facing criminal prosecution if they fail to protect users' identities.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before the election Theresa May promised to rebalance the relationship between internet users and the technology industry, pledging to lead the world in internet regulation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ministers will today spell out the details of a Data Protection Bill to be introduced in the Commons next month. It will include the right of adults to request the deletion of social media content they posted as children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While that measure was expected, ministers will say that they intend also to expand the definition of personal data to include IP addresses and cookies. Matthew Hancock, digital policy minister, said that the bill would con-tain the most robust, yet dynamic, data laws in the world. &quot;It will give people more control over their data, require more consent for its use and prepare Britain for Brexit,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Experts said that it could have farreaching effects on companies that trade in anonymised data harvested online. Some offer cheap genetic tests for genealogy and then sell the information to medical researchers. Officials said that the bill would tighten up consent requirements and punish those that failed to protect individuals' identities. &quot;The reliance on default opt-out or pre-selected 'tick boxes', which are largely ignored, to give consent for organisations to collect personal data will become a thing of the past,&quot; one said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With fines of up to &pound;17 million or 4 per cent of global turnover, companies also face criminal sanctions if they are found to have been &quot;either intentionally or recklessly creating situations where someone could be identified from anonymised data&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Retailers increasingly rely on supposedly anonymised browsing data to target advertising. Researchers in Germany have exposed how easily identities could be uncovered, discovering the pornography preferences of a judge from anonymised data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The measures are designed to bring Britain into line with the EU's general data protection regulation (GDPR).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vikki Hoyle, of the solicitors Walker Morris, said that the present data protection regime was created before the advent of Google, Amazon and Facebook. The EU regulation had been designed to deal with advances in technology over the past 20 years and for the next two decades, she added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are fewer than ten months to go until GDPR comes into force and there is still a lot of uncertainty about how some provisions will work in practice,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Data Protection Bill will hopefully bring some much needed clarity on how data protection will be regulated in the UK under GDPR and post-Brexit. However, the government's announcement leaves a lot of blanks still to be filled in.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Manchester company Purple sneakily inserted the bizarre clauses into its terms and conditions as a bit of a joke - with only ONE person spotting it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the tasks listed were cleaning festival toilets, scraping chewing gum off the streets cleaning animal waste from parks, hugging stray cats and dogs, manually tackling sewer blockages and scraping chewing gum off the streets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 22,000 people 'agreed' to carry out the uninviting tasks over a two week period, presumably because they failed to read the small print and inadvertently agreed to the terms and conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those panicking they're set for 1,000 hours of community service - equivalent to 125 eight-hour shifts - will be relieved to know they won't be forced to don a pair of rubber gloves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why you should ALWAYS read the terms and conditions before signing up for public WiFi</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The clause was a gag inserted into the terms to highlight the lack of consumer awareness when signing up to free wifi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Purple bosses wanted to make the point that most people often have no idea what they're actually committing themselves to when agreeing to a network's terms and conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All users were given the chance to flag up the clause in return for a prize. Remarkably, just ONE person spotted it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Purple CEO Gavin Wheeldontold Manchester Evening News: &quot;Wifi users need to read the terms when they sign up to access a network.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What they are agreeing to, how much data are they sharing, and what license are they giving to providers?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our experiment shows it's all too easy to consent to something unfair.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The free online shopping tool that reckons it can save you &pound;425 a year - thanks to a very handy feature</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Purple unveiled its findings to coincide with this week's announcement it is the first General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) compliant wifi provider.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This relates to European legislation, due to come into force in May next year, which bosses at Purple say will 'reshape the way organisations approach data privacy and allow end users to gain more access to the data collected about them'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gavin added: &quot;We welcome the strengthening of data protection laws across Europe that GDPR will bring.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Not only will it give wifi users more control over how their personal data is being used by companies, it will also raise the level of trust in the digital economy.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If a Brexit planner, a drone photographer and a gaming &quot;shoutcaster&quot; were stuck in a lift or stranded on a desert island, what would they talk about? What could they possibly have in common? More than we might imagine. They could, for instance, discuss how technology and other big changes were transforming the labour market.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If a lift engineer or rescue ship had not arrived by nightfall, they might even work out that none of their jobs even existed over a year ago. They are not alone. Social media managers, You-Tube influencers, data scientists and machine learning engineers are among those in roles that had not been invented when they were at school.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Who would have thought that hotels, golf courses, construction companies, insurers and news organisations seek pilots to fly unmanned aircraft systems or drones for aerial videos, photographs, mapping or data? Drone operators are in high demand. The gaming industry, in which Britain is a world leader, is one of the sectors most active in inventing new jobs. Virtual reality and artificial intelligence have spurred new engineering roles in machine learning, data mining and coding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So too has electronic or esports, whose popularity is such that professional gamers command large audiences with excitable commentary from shoutcasters. Really.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then there is political or regulatory change, with Brexit the obvious example. David Davis, secretary of state for exiting the European Union, and his hastily recruited Whitehall ministry, are not the only people whose jobs were created by last year's vote. Many organisations are hiring Brexit planners, for whom clairvoyance is presumably an added advantage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Doug Monro, of the job search engine Adzuna, said: &quot;The recent surge in political and technological change can hardly have gone unnoticed. And the UK job market is starting to ring the changes, with new jobs being created for talented Brexit planners, GDPR [data protection] advisers and social media advisers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Much as the Oxford English Dictionary adds new words, labour analysts at the Office for National Statistics are adding to their job classifications. Proposals include mobile app developer, game designer and digital marketer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jo Twist, chief executive of Ukie, which represents the gaming industry, said: &quot;Around 65 per cent of today's students will be doing jobs that don't currently exist yet, showing just how fastmoving today's job market is.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IT IS hardly a household name, in fact few people will have ever heard of Worldpay. Yet, the company knows lots about you and almost everything you buy. Such power is why the business - part of the Royal Bank of Scotland until it was forced to sell it in 2010 as part of its government bailout - found itself at the centre of a takeover battle between two US financial giants last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Responsible for around 400 electronic payments every second, analysts predicted that the FTSE 100 firm could trigger a wave of counterbids from technology giants such as Google, Apple or Amazon - in a rapidly expanding digital world, knowing what, when and where people buy things has never been so alluring.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you have 42pc market share in the payments industry [as Worldpay does in the UK], then you can see what people are buying on a daily basis,&quot; noted Robin Van den Broek, an analyst at Mediobanca. &quot;With this data [a company] could phone me up tomorrow and give me three products I would probably buy immediately. That data makes a lot of sense to have.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With that hanging over the two interested parties - payment rival Vantiv and banking giant JP Morgan Chase - the former wasted no time in getting its offer on the table. A day after the talks emerged and Worldpay's shares soared 28pc, a merger was agreed with Vantiv, JP Morgan withdrew its interest (making clear on its way out that it had been responding to an invite from the group) and Worldpay's shares fell 8pc. It is still possible that others could swoop in. But the frenzied 24-hour tug-of-war for Worldpay points to a wider battle among large businesses as they race to adapt to a world that is becoming increasingly cashless.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given the choice, more than a third of Europeans would only pay for things electronically, according to a recent study by ING bank, while 78pc of respondents said they use cash less than they did just a year ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some stores are even ditching their cash registers altogether so that staff don't waste time counting coins or sending money to a bank. Inspired by a trip to Sweden, which printed Europe's first banknote 350 years ago but is steadily moving towards a cashless society, caf&eacute; owner Ross Brown decided to stop accepting cash at his London-based coffee shop Browns of Brockley seven months ago and is yet to see his sales drop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Fair enough most people don't consider it when they go to a shop, but from a business point of view you spend a lot of time [processing cash payments] and 99.9pc of the population aren't offended to pay for something on their card,&quot; the 29-yearold said, adding that only around 30pc of customers paid with notes or coins before the change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What are you more likely to have on you, cash or card? We always said we'd trial it [going cashless] but it's been so great there's no reason to change.&quot; You only need to look at Worldpay to see how successful payment processing firms - once the unglamorous corner of the financial services market - have become as consumers shun cash for the convenience of &quot;tap and go&quot; or online.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 16,000 hairdressers, 24,000 restaurants and 9,000 pubs in the UK currently use technology from Worldpay, which since listing in 2015 has seen its stock market value more than double to over &pound;8bn. But it is not the only payment processor attracting attention from bigger businesses. Days before the group revealed that it was in takeover talks with JP Morgan and Vantiv, Danish payments processor Nets said it was &quot;reviewing its options&quot; after being approached by a number of buyers, thought to include Visa and Mastercard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When announcements like this happen it creates activity among a lot of players,&quot; said Imran Gulamhuseinwala, EY's global head of financial technology. &quot;There is an emerging group of payment winners which are credible and growing quickly. If you roll the clock forward a decade or so you'd expect [this sector] to be dominated by a few large-scale players.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eager to be in the lucrative club of big players, banks and technology businesses are digging deep into their pockets to see who they can partner up with. As digital becomes a key part of financial services, it could soon be hard to tell the two sectors apart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, the aim of these changes is to open up the payments market. The second Payment Services Directive (PSD2), for example, will lower the barriers for entry to third-party providers as banks will be forced to give them greater access to their customer data, while the UK Government's forthcoming &quot;open banking&quot; scheme is aimed at accelerating technological change in the retail banking sector. Banks will also have to change the way they handle customer data under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) coming into force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The financial services sector is in the early stages of a shake-up spurred by emerging technology, evolving customer habits and a changing regulatory landscape,&quot; said Liz Brandt, the chief executive of specialist consultancy Ctrl-Shift.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are seeing the blurring of the lines in the industry as a new breed of challenger banks, fintech start-ups and tech companies fight with established banks for market share.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But adapting to the regulatory landscape is not enough to become a heavyweight in what is looking likely to be a future where cash is redundant. In fact, if they don't work together that future could be a bit of a mess.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The [Worldpay] battle is a classic case where we see the future, but can't get there, at least not easily - and certainly not by each company acting on its own,&quot; said Ben Gomes-Casseres, a professor of strategy at Brandeis International Business School and the author of Remix Strategy: The Three Laws of Business Combinations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The future of cashless payments requires that a number of things fall in place - from consumer acceptance and mobile device standards, to interconnected payment systems and security standards. The whole payments ecosystem needs to evolve, but it cannot do so piece by piece, because every new technology requires others to succeed,&quot; said Mr Gomes-Casseres.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Britain's charities, 2015 was an annus horribilis. A series of high profile and tragic cases exposed some extremely aggressive fundraising practices, which seemed to prioritise raising as much money as possible as quickly as possible without much thought to the consequences, notably for the donors being targeted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are a charitable nation and should be very proud of that fact. But these stories rightly shocked Britain, and our trust in the charity sector has been sorely tested.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It should be no surprise, therefore, that they have led to significant changes to the regulations governing fundraising in this country, designed both to restore that trust and to ensure that such terrible practices are never again tolerated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From this Thursday, for example, you will have the power to control the flow of communications that you receive from charities thanks to the Fundraising Preference Service (FPS). Developed and operated by the Fundraising Regulator, which I chair, it will enable you to block direct marketing communications from particular charities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In practice, this will mean that you will be able to go online or pick up a phone and name charities from which you no longer want to receive post, phone, text or email marketing communications. This will give you unprecedented control over which organisations contact you and how they do it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is not a &quot;silver bullet&quot; that will instantly rebuild the relationship between the charitable sector and the public. That can only be achieved when charities change their behaviour. Yet there are some promising signs that this is happening already.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the year since the Fundraising Regulator was founded, we have seen many charities make a real effort to review their practices, leading to innovative and creative approaches that put the donor first. In February, we published a number of case studies to show how some charities are doing just that, making sure they have their supporters at the heart of what they do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, there is a long way to go. Too many charities are proving to be laggards. But they will have to follow suit, whether they like it or not, due to another new regulation which comes into force next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most high-profile cases of poor behaviour were the result of charities not using their data and &quot;consent to contact&quot; information properly, so that they were targeting and in some cases overwhelming vulnerable people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which becomes law on May 25 next year, will mean that charities will have to gain clear consent to market to their donors and other supporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Business is affected too and many current practices will have to change as the new regulations strengthen individual rights to privacy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year Jack Parsons, a business and law student, finished his degree, participated on a Bord Bia business accelerator and won a UCD Startup Stars award for O'Kale Krisps, the kale snack business he set up with fellow student Oisin McElhinney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His business education is only just beginning. His first lesson: how to cope with red tape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have just taken on our first staff member,&quot; said Parsons. &quot;It's only part time, yet there are all sorts of employer's PRSI and insurance involved. We are learning as we go.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The regulatory burden takes in tax, health and safety, the environment, data protection, employment and company law - and weighs heavily on the owners of small businesses.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a survey by the Small Firms Association (SFA), 10% of business owners rated bureaucracy as the biggest risk facing their business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Part of the problem is that it takes all sorts of different guises,&quot; said Linda Barry, the SFA acting director.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest employer obligation is the general data protection regulation (GDPR), a Europen Union directive which is due to be implemented within 12 months. The rules introduce tougher fines for non-compliance and breaches, and give people more say over what companies can do with their data. &quot;Small businesses are only beginning to become aware of its possible impact - a nightmare considering the size of the fines involved if they get it wrong,&quot; said Barry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A survey from the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner found that, with just a year to go until GDPR's introduction, only 14% of small and mediumsized enterprises had started preparing. &quot;The capacity for small-business owners to absorb ever increasing amounts of regulation is small,&quot; said Barry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Owners already wear so many hats, there are only so many hours in the day, and the bottom line is that they have to get on with running their businesses.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government's action plan for jobs contains a commitment to &quot;think small first&quot;. It says proposed legislation should be thoroughly assessed with regard to the costs to business. This is a step in the right direction, according to Barry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We want small business put front of mind across all government departments,&quot; she said. &quot;Each initiative might only add a small impact to a business, yet cumulatively they can have a big effect.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A report from the National Competitiveness Council found that, while Ireland rates well in terms of ease of starting a business, once you get going that is no longer the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Employment legislation is a case in point. &quot;There are 40 pieces of primary legislation attaching to employment alone. Once you employ just one other person, you go from zero to a situation where all [laws] are immediately applicable, with heavy fines if you get it wrong,&quot; said Barry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hoteliers Jenny and Justin Green have developed their home, Ballyvolane House, into one of the country's most sought-after wedding venues. They were also pioneers of glamping in Ireland. Last year they launched a gin distillery, producing Bertha's Revenge, an awardwinning brand of milk gin that they export worldwide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The red tape can be stifling, according to Jenny Green. &quot;It is hours and hours of work - and cost to the business - that the customer never sees,&quot; she said. &quot;You can't afford to slip up. We're not a big business, but if I didn't employ a person in the office to help me look after it all, I'd be a nervous wreck.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Neil McDonnell, of the small-business lobby group Isme, the key point is to ensure that regulation is applied at an &quot;appropriate level&quot;. If existing regulations were enforced before being scrapped and replaced with new ones, that would help business owners who are struggling to keep up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Take trucking, for example, which is seeing new limits being introduced. Why not just enforce the ones that are there?&quot; In employment law, he believes that the balance of rights has swung too far in favour of employees, at the expense of small businesses. In an increasingly litigious environment, some employees may be encouraged to &quot;game the system&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An aggrieved employee in the transport sector, for example, could report a business to Nera, the employment rights authority; the Health and Safety Authority's workplace contact unit; and the Road Safety Authority. &quot;The company is required to deal with these multiple agencies,&quot; said McDonnell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Proposed legislation in relation to zero- and low-hour contracts is causing consternation. An estimated 2.6% of the total labour market works on a constantly variable part-time basis, according to the employers' organisation Ibec.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This legislation will remove flexibility and increase cost and administration in all operations that need to cater for peaky, unexpected demand in roundthe-clock factories and service or hospitality operations,&quot; said an aviation sector executive, who asked not to be named.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Zero-hour contracts is the headline [and] a Trojan horse which no one really contests, but the detail affects other parttime, flexi contracts adversely.&quot; It is, he added, &quot;the last thing we need in the current environment where we need to retain competitiveness and flexibility&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a balance to be struck between having a minimum standard and a gold-plated one - and there is nothing wrong with a minimum standard, claimed Ian Talbot, chief executive of Chambers Ireland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In hospitality there are a plethora of different licensing and health and safety requirements, with separate bodies doing separate audits,&quot; he said. &quot;If you need to engage a solicitor to keep your licences up to date, that's time and fees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Few companies go to the trouble of assessing the cost of all this activity that is not selling. But [falling foul of the regulations] worries people, so they spend a disproportionate amount of time checking, and money on professional fees.&quot; Tweaking the tax code to help small businesses would help, said photographer Agata Stoinska, founder of fashion platform Maven46 and content creation agency M46 Create. She believes a reduction in employer's PRSI levels would be a boon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's really killing you,&quot; she said. &quot;You feel like you are doing a good thing employing someone, but then you have to pay a huge cost on top. We could have put the money into employing more people or paying the people we have better.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result, Stoinska tries to avoid the cost by hiring on a contract basis instead. &quot;But it's not good for the worker because they don't get a stable job. It's not good for us as a business either, because if they get a better contract they will go. And it's not good for the economy as a whole because it doesn't help growth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a balance to be struck between a minimum standard and a gold-plated one. There is nothing wrong with a minimum standard</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over two thirds of UK businesses are &quot;not making adequate preparations&quot; for the UK's withdrawal from the European Union, according to senior business leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A third of respondents to&nbsp;the&nbsp;survey, which was carried out by Interim Partners, said Brexit was the biggest upcoming challenge for businesses.&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However,&nbsp;69pc of UK businesses are not preparing adequately for the regulatory changes thrown up by the Brexit process, according to those surveyed, meaning many businesses are likely to struggle with the&nbsp;fallout unless they start preparations immediately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One respondent from the group said that businesses must &quot;reassess their operating model and restructure to become more flexible... to adapt quickly to the shape and impact of Brexit becomes clearer&quot;.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group was almost evenly split over the impact of Brexit on foreign investors  -&nbsp;whether it would cause their investments to increase or decrease.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In light of the lack of preparation, turnaround specialists will be in high demand over the coming years, according to 41pc&nbsp;of the business leaders surveyed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                             Brexit anniversary: what happens next?                         01:32</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A second issue expected to face UK businesses is&nbsp;digital transformation, with around 21pc of respondents saying this would be&nbsp;the greatest challenge in the coming years.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Firms may not have prepared for the emergence of 5G and biometric developments, as well as&nbsp;the introduction of General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR).&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GDPR will come into law from May 2018, and centres around how companies manage their customer and employee data, superseding the Data Protection Act of 1998 that the UK currently uses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another digital issue businesses are expected to face comes&nbsp;from their failure to invest in data management and technology, leaving public and private sector organisations at risk from increasingly sophisticated cyber attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A digital shift could be worsened by a possible&nbsp;difficult withdrawal from the complex digital EU regulatory framework, the survey found.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ireland's data protection commissioner - the lead regulator for tech giants Facebook, Google and Twitter across Europe - has warned of being swamped under Europe's new data regime and says the office will need to almost treble in size over the next couple of years.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under EU rules which are set to come into force in May 2018, Ireland will act as the lead supervisory authority in Europe for all the internet multinationals based here. Helen Dixon, the data protection commissioner (DPC), said the regulator was working with PwC to analyse the requirements of its changing role.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Individuals are acquiring new rights, data controllers new obligations and data protection authorities new supervisory functions,&quot; Dixon told this newspaper last week. &quot;Data protection authorities in Europe are acquiring much greater enforcement powers and will have the capability to impose large fines - up to (EURO)20m or 4% of global turnover. All of these features will mean that the Irish data protection commissioner requires additional staff and skills.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new regime extends the scope of the data protection law to all foreign companies processing data of EU residents and harmonises regulations in the EU. The Irish government has already been lobbied by internet giants about how it will handle the new general data protection regulation (GDPR).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dixon also said that Brexit could increase the regulator's workload as more data-rich companies could relocate to Ireland. She said this &quot;would need to be factored into staffing needs&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The budget for the data protection commissioner increased fourfold to (EURO)7.5m between 2013 and 2017. Staffing levels have risen from under 30 in 2014 to more than 70.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We will add about 30 staff in 2017, bringing our total to between 90 and 100 by the end of the year,&quot; said Dixon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She added that the PwC project would allow the commissioner to estimate more accurately its future staffing needs, but she expected recruitment requirements to be significant again next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I anticipate the Irish DPC will need to grow to over 200 staff in the next couple of years given the span and scale of its supervisory role,&quot; said Dixon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier this month, she told the Oireachtas committee on justice and equality that she &quot;certainly envisages&quot; a significant increase in workload.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of this will be due to the regulator having a broader range of powers and functions under the new data policies. Dixon added that she believed part of the increased workload would stem more complaints as the rules would force organisations to be more transparent and accountable about what data they held and how it was used.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Google and Facebook sought clarity from the Irish government about how it would apply the new rules during the first four months of the year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a return on the lobby register, Google held meetings about GDPR with Paschal Donohoe, who was then minister for public expenditure and reform, and Dara Murphy, then a minister for data protection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It sought to &quot;emphasise the need to achieve maximum harmonisation in the transposition of the GDPR across member states and to encourage regulatory investment to support the digital economy&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook also held a meeting with Murphy to &quot;seek clarity on Ireland's approach&quot; to the new rules.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Small businesses are being warned that they risk enormous fines if they ignore an overhaul of data protection rules that will affect organisations of all sizes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The biggest change in a quarter of a century in how companies process information, such as customer lists and employee records, comes into force next May, yet there is little awareness among smaller organisations.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The general data protection regulation rules, which emanate from Brussels, are designed to hand control of personal data to individuals rather than organisations. A survey of more than 1,000 small companies, commissioned by Irwin Mitchell, a law firm, found that 78 per had not heard of the new rules, while 86 per cent were not aware of the threat of fines. Only 11 per cent had started preparing for it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Businesses must be much clearer on how customer data is collected and stored, they have to make it easier for customers to tell organisations to &quot;forget&quot; them and must provide greater protection for children. Any data breaches (as a result of hacking, for example) must be communicated within three days to the Information Commissioner's Office, the data regulator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Companies will be required to obtain an unequivocal &quot;positive indication of agreement&quot; to personal data being processed. Silence will no longer count as consent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Personal data means a name, a photo, an email address, bank details, posts on social networking websites, medical information or a computer IP address.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Organisations that fail to comply can be fined up to 4 per cent of their annual global turnover, or (EURO)20 million, whichever is larger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Matthew Pryke, partner at Hamlins, another law firm, said: &quot;Too many businesses are complacent. Those who leave it to chance and don't prepare now could be left high and dry if the ICO finds that businesses breach regulations. Given the ICO will need to fund its operations via these fines, it seems inevitable for examples to be made and hefty fines imposed as soon as the legislation comes into force.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The European Union says that the rules will &quot;reshape the way organisations across the region approach data privacy&quot;. The government has indicated that Britain's decision to leave the EU will not affect the introduction of the rules.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Times understands that the Federation of Small Businesses has warned its members that the rules will increase costs. Craig Beaumont, head of external affairs at the FSB, said that GDPR would increase the already burdensome data protection regulations. He said: &quot;Small firms across the UK and Europe do not know about it. We are asking ministers and the ICO to create an awareness-raising campaign over the summer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ICO is compiling guidance on how to comply with the rules, which is available on its website.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">TECHNOLOGY; Version:1</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">741 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The European Union is considering banning the implementation of so-called &quot;backdoors&quot; that allow the reading of encrypted messaging, a move that would place it in conflict with the UK government's desire to have access to all secure communications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The draft report by the European parliament's Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs says the data protection regulations have not kept pace with advances in technology and that amendments to the 2002 Regulation on Privacy and Electronic Communications (ePrivacy) are required.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Part of the amendments, proposed by the European Commission in January and now reviewed by the European parliament, look to deal with so-called over-the-top (OTT) services. The services replicate the functionality of traditional communications systems, such as landline telephones, but aren't not regulated in the same way and so are not affording similar protections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, the UK government has repeatedly called for ways to gain access to encrypted communications such as the end-to-end encryption (E2EE) used by Signal and WhatsApp, which prevents the interception of private messages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The EU draft proposal categorically rules out such measures. It says: &quot;The providers of electronic communications services shall ensure that there is sufficient protection in place against unauthorised access or alterations to the electronic communications data, and that the confidentiality and safety of the transmission are also guaranteed by the nature of the means of transmission used, or by state-of-the-art end-to-end encryption of the electronic communications data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Furthermore, when encryption of electronic communications data is used, decryption, reverse engineering or monitoring of such communications shall be prohibited.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the wake of terror attacks across the UK earlier this year the home secretary, Amber Rudd, backed by Downing Street, repeatedly called for access to messages sent via communications services that use E2EE. The issue was repeated in the Conservative manifesto.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Europe's draft amendments specifically ban such attempts by government: &quot;Member States shall not impose any obligations on electronic communications service providers that would result in the weakening of the security and encryption of their networks and services.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How the impending Brexit negotiations will impact legislation such as the IPA is currently unclear. By the time amendments are made to the ePrivacy directive, the UK is likely to have completed the Brexit process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new proposed amendments are part of sweeping changes regarding digital communications and privacy kicked off by the new, tougher General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which is due to come into force in 2018, as well as the legislation around the single digital market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ePrivacy directive change proposals seek to bring the 2002 law in line with the newer GDPR and attempt to keep pace with technological development. They also cover the tracking of users for advertising, the collection of metadata and behavioural data, an the explicit consent required to do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The amendments will have to journey through a multi-stage process including approval by the European parliament and European council before becoming law, but they were welcomed by privacy and security experts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lukasz Olejnik, an independent security and privacy technology researcher said the amendments &quot;significantly improve security and privacy properties&quot; of the EU's regulations and that they were &quot;a step in a great direction&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The end-to-end aspect is additionally of interest due to the worldwide campaign of weakening cryptography and introducing backdoors. Such voices are in the USA, Australia, Germany, France and UK. These last points put ePrivacy on a potential collision course with the supposedly imminent regulations negatively affecting cybersecurity and privacy,&quot; Olejnik said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The proposed ePrivacy amendments come at a time when the EU is suggesting it might seek to give law enforcement the power to directly access cloud storage to retrieve electronic evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Part of a three-option proposal that will form the basis of future legislative reform for what EU Justice Commissioner Vera Jourova said was &quot;an extraordinary measure for extraordinary threats&quot;, the EU is seeking to speed up the process of evidence collection in the wake of terror attacks cross Europe.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only time will tell whether last week's electoral diversion will lead to a better destination for the nation or mark the definitive point of decline for the UK as a global power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At a constitutional level, it would appear that both IndyRef2 and hard Brexit may be off the table for now,&quot; says Philip Rodney, the chairman of the Scottish firm Burness Paull, reflecting on the success of the Conservatives north of the border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In any case, every cloud has a silver lining and for many lawyers the departure of Liz Truss from the Ministry of Justice might make the chaos seem worthwhile. As David Corker, of Corker Binning, observed: &quot;Truss had lost the confidence of the judiciary and her move away from the justice portfolio was inevitable. A justice secretary who fails to defend the judiciary from ill-informed tabloid attacks cannot remain in post.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So what of her successor, the almost unknown David Lidington? &quot;While perhaps a little disappointed that the prime minister has not utilised some of the undoubted legal talent available to her, one cannot deny David Lidington's intellectual credentials,&quot; says Clive O'Connell, of McCarthy Denning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those intellectual credentials may have to be deployed in some neat policy backflips. For example, the much abused proposal in the Conservative manifesto to merge the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) with the National Crime Agency (NCA) looks likely to be abandoned. &quot;Jeremy Corbyn's election success has surely sunk any chance of Theresa May's ill-starred proposal to merge the SFO with the NCA. Losing the SFO would be a serious blow for the UK's anti-fraud and corruption capability,&quot; says Corker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The biggest backflip of all might be over Brexit. &quot;We might now see the UK seek to retain its membership of the EU single market through renewed membership of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) - the so-called Norway option,&quot; says Glenn Kangisser, of Haynes and Boone CDG. &quot;If that becomes official government policy, we're already slow out of the blocks to obtain the agreement of all 27 EU members and the four members of EFTA before March 2019.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The critical juncture will be when votes are called in the House of Commons. &quot;The government is stuck between a rock and a hard place,&quot; says Robert Bell, of Bryan Cave. &quot;It has not got enough support for a hard Brexit [and] nor does it have a mandate. Although there is officially no need for a vote until the government comes back from Brussels with a deal, there are going to be many opportunities for opponents of a hard Brexit to force concessions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A key moment for this, he adds, could be the passage of the Great Repeal Bill, by which time the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) might be pulling the central strings. &quot;The DUP's keenness to keep an open border with the Republic of Ireland and the rest of the UK, could lead towards a more open mind towards remaining part of the Customs Union, which already includes the non-EU British territories of Guernsey, Jersey and the Isle of Man,&quot; points out Nicholas Evans, a partner and parliamentary agent at Bircham Dyson Bell. Despite the talk of a more centrist approach, Ed Parker, of Mayer Brown, sends out a warning note. &quot;Uncertainty is the new certainty, and that is definitely bad for business,&quot; he says. &quot;Rewind 12 months and the series of events we have seen has been unpredictable.&quot; The lack of certainty is not well received in the wider world, he adds. &quot;Institutions are updating their Brexit plans, but no major decisions are likely to be taken until negotiations get under way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even so, as Sally Shorthose, of Bird &amp; Bird, observes: &quot;The EU has made it clear that exit terms are to be agreed before any discussion about trading terms, free movement and co-operation on regulations can take place. This delay and uncertainty is not good for business and may hasten the exit of company headquarters from the UK.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To stem such an exodus it is important that Brexit should not monopolise the government's attention, says Nigel Teasdale, the president of the Forum of Insurance Lawyers and a DWF partner. &quot;It is only right that Brexit will dominate the political landscape given the range and significance of the legal and commercial issues it raises,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is crucial, though, that the government does not lose sight of other issues. In particular, we would urge the government to press on with the Vehicle Technology and Aviation Bill, which fell by the wayside when the election was called. This bill is essential to address concerns around insurance liability for driverless vehicles and keep the UK at the forefront of developing technology.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Equally important is the implementation of General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which is due to come into force in May next year. &quot;Retention of the GDPR in the UK is a significant issue for businesses, not least because without it, there is a greater probability that the UK will not be afforded data protection 'adequacy' status by the European Commission post-Brexit,&quot; says Aaron P Simpson, the managing partner of Hunton and Williams's London office. Upon these bread and butter pieces of legislation our future depends. They must not be overlooked.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The number of fines handed out for breaking UK data protection laws almost doubled last year, making Britain one of the most active regions for regulatory enforcement across Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to figures from the UK's Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) analysed by professional services firm PwC, fines for data protection breaches hit over &pound;3.2m in 2016, putting the UK on par with Italy, where fines totaled &pound;3.3m, but dramatically below the US where fines of approximately $250m (&pound;195m) were served. A recent PwC survey found that 90 per cent of chief executive officers globally believe breaches of data privacy and ethics have a negative impact on stakeholder trust, and PwC warned that ahead of new regulation coming into force next year it was therefore paramount that businesses prioritise security and privacy.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last Thursday marked a year until the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) comes into effect. Non-compliance penalties could lead to fines of up to Euro 20m (&pound;17.5m) or 4 per cent of a company's global annual turnover. &quot;We've performed more than 150 GDPR readiness assessments with our clients around the world. Many struggle to know where to start with their preparations, but also how to move programmes beyond just risk reviews and data analysis to delivering real operational change,&quot; said Stewart Room, PwC's global cyber security and data protection legal services leader.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that the ICO can currently issue fines of up to &pound;500,000, but considering how big the fines will be for not complying with GDPR, it is important that UK organisations use the coming months to prepare. In 2016, 35 fines were served for breaking data protection laws in the UK, compared to 18 in 2015 for a total of just over &pound;2m. That already represented a sharp increase from the &pound;1.2m issued in 2014.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">By Peter Foster , Europe Editor</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEWS; Version:2</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1329 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Project Fear, as last year's&nbsp;Remain referendum campaign was so successfully dubbed by Brexiteers, was a failure because it failed to strike sufficient fear into the hearts of the voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     A year after Brexit, the sky has still not fallen, and the worst of the Treasury's dire predictions - the recession, the 500,000 job losses - have still not come to pass.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prophesies proved empty in part because of mitigation measures the Treasury itself put in place&nbsp;but deliberately ignored when issuing their own warnings about a vote to leave.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was a piece of intellectual dishonesty that even today corrodes the trust between government and governed.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So it is doubly extraordinary, as we approach the start of Brexit negotiations proper, that history appears to be repeating itself.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Project Fear 2.0 is more amorphous than the original version since it is not propagated by the Government this time, but it paints a similarly catastrophic and unbelievable picture of the 'no deal' and the 'bad deal' scenarios for Brexit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                                        &lt;table&gt;                                                                           </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No deal also means no flights, no imports/exports, no medicines, qualifications and standards not recognised, limited range of food ....etc https://t.co/VzUuf21EKk</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - Helen Rushby (@HelenRushby1) May 29, 2017                                                                                  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And just like the Treasury mandarins before them, the Brexit Cassandras offer their warnings&nbsp;without reference to the steps the UK would actually take in mitigation, or to the fact that the EU would take measures to protect itself from economic blowback of a no-deal scenario.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Common predictions of doom include stock market crashes, UK aeroplanes unable to fly into Europe, troops back on the Irish border, companies lost in data limbo, the docks of Dover and Rotterdam at a standstill, and the financial markets of London all on the point of collapse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All of these scenarios are, if the EU had an absolute death wish, possible. The EU could refuse, for example, to recognise the validity of British-registered aeroplanes' safety certifications and block all point-to-point flights in Europe, but there are very many good reasons why they would not do that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                                        &lt;table&gt;                                                                           </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">. @theresa_may to Paxman: No deal better than a bad deal. Hope that's a negotiating tactic &amp; not serious. No deal would mean fin mkt collapse</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Charles Grant (@CER_Grant) May 29, 2017                                                                                  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Firstly, the EU knows perfectly well that the UK certifications are materially valid, and that the UK as a responsible developed-world former partner, would not imperil either UK or EU citizens by cutting corners on safety. A status quo agreement is perfectly easily done.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Secondly there is commercial self-interest. London Heathrow is Europe's busiest airport, with 75 million passengers a year and EU airlines need access to that global hub. Some 60 per cent&nbsp;of UK air passengers land in Europe where they spend money on holidays and doing business.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political common sense and economic imperative says it is simply in no-one's interest to blow all that up. If the Brexit talks go pear-shaped, which they well might if the political temperature isn't lowered, the blame-game will begin in earnest and will it land squarely in the EU's court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If air links were shut down - just think of the recent BA chaos and multiply by a thousand - then it will only be because the EU side wants to make a point, not because the UK isn't happy to agree to an interim agreement that keeps the planes in the air.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                             May: Corbyn would be 'alone and naked' in Brexit negotiations                         01:35</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By the same token, the EU could withdraw financial passporting and mutual recognition agreements from the City overnight, but again not without significant risk. It would be inflicting pain and chaos on itself, even as it punished Britain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similarly the EU could in theory put a stop to data-flows between the UK and the EU by refusing to recognise the UK's post-Brexit data protection regime, but it won't because data is the lifeblood of modern business and trade must go on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like the shutting of the airports, this risk is wildly overstated. The UK is signing into law the EU's new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) which will in turn be swallowed by the Great Repeal Bill. There will be no real grounds to stop the flows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is true, when it comes to data, that national security issues will need to be taken into consideration post-Brexit, but if Israel and the US can get an adequacy agreement, there will be no reason why the UK will not too - other than political vindictiveness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In practice, data will keep flowing - because it must - just as it did when the European Court of Justice threw out the US-EU 'Safe Harbour' data sharing agreement which was later replaced by Privacy Shield, which itself may fall in the courts. But data will still flow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The asymmetries of the negotiation might well mean that a 'no deal' scenario would be more painful for Britain than for Europe, but that does not - as so many Remoaners would have us believe - make it painless for the European side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brexit | The European Union's draft negotiation principles</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commentators who say that Mrs Merkel 'won't bat an eyelid' if the UK walks away from the table are just drinking the Kool Aid. Europe, a continent riven by economic and political divisions, has plenty of skin in this game. This may be an unequal contest, but it is not a 'no-contest'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">None of this is to underestimate the technical, legal and bureaucratic&nbsp;complexities of resolving and duplicating such arrangements in a post-Brexit world, but this is precisely why the 'Remoaner' scaremongering is so counter-productive.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It leaves most ordinary people rolling their eyes and - as with the original Project Fear - dismissing the actual concrete, long-term risks posed by a destructive Brexit deal: the lost decade, the slow death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These risk are, as Mrs May now warns, very real. Our &quot;future prosperity&quot; depends on getting this&nbsp;right. Beginning on June 19, the public will be confronted rapidly with the costs, compromises and contradictions implicit in Brexit that have so far not been properly acknowledged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scaremongering is not useful. What is needed&nbsp;is a dose of&nbsp;cold-hearted realism, from Brexiteers and Remoaners alike.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BRITISH companies risk being forced out of business by new EU-wide data laws that will leave ill-prepared businesses exposed to multi-billion pound fines, research shows.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) next year will require businesses across the bloc to take extra steps to protect customer data and be more transparent about how it is used.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With less than a year until the rules take effect next May, just a third of UK companies have started preparing for the shake-up, while 60pc were completely unaware of the rules, according to a survey commissioned by law firm Irwin Mitchell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The YouGov poll of 2,000 businesses also showed that 71pc were unaware of the harsher penalties that could be enforced, with a maximum financial penalty of (EURO)20m (&pound;17.5m) - or 4pc of global turnover. This comes despite 18pc respondents stating they would go out of business if they received the maximum punishment, while one in ten said they would need to make &quot;significant&quot; job cuts. Joanne Bone, a partner at Irwin Mitchell, said: &quot;May's deadline is fastapproaching and with so much at stake, our study reveals there's a very real possibility that the majority of organisations will not be compliant in time.&quot; The new rules, which come into force a year before the UK leaves the EU, state that businesses will have to report data breaches within 72 hours to regulators where there is an impact on privacy, such as a customer database being hacked. The sweeping rules encompass a wide range of personal information including employee, payroll and pension data, and will also apply to sole-traders and partnerships.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, a third of businesses surveyed believed the rules would not apply to them, while a quarter said they would not be able to detect a breach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&pound;17.5m The maximum fine firms could face if they do not comply with EU-wide data laws which are due to be introduced next year</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A survey of nearly 200 senior professionals working in retail banks, investment banks and asset management firms, conducted by information provider LexisNexisRisk Solutions, shows that 44 per cent currently perceive so-called evolving criminal methodologies, like cyber crime, to be the single biggest financial crime risk for their businesses.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A total of 41 per cent say that such methodologies will represent the biggest risk over the coming 12 months, but 92 per cent said that they are concerned that their organisation's legacy technology is&quot;a barrier to fighting financial crime over the next one to two years&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And a staggering 87 per cent said that their business isn't able to enhance their technology fast enough to counter evolving criminal methods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Criminal methodologies are constantly evolving and financial institutions are struggling to keep up with their changing tactics when implementing financial crime defences. For those tasked with combatting financial crime it can feel as if they are fighting twenty first century criminals with twentieth century tools,&quot; said Dean Curtis, managing director at LexisNexis Risk Solutions for the UK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our report shows financial crime professionals do not believe the industry is doing enough to leverage the advantages of technology to fight financial crime.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report found that the problem is being compounded by the regulatory environment and the associated costs. Increased regulations require investment in new technologies and 60 per cent of respondents to the survey cited this as a root cause of cost increases. Since 2015, 63 per cent of financial institutions say their financial crime compliance costs have increased, whilst just 2 per cent say they have decreased.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The risk of cyber crimemoved into sharp focus after tens of thousands of individuals across almost 100 countries were affected by a massive cyber-attack earlier this month. That attack, known as &quot;Wannacry&quot;, was believed to be one of the largest of its kind. It affected hospitals, companies, universities and governments, including theNHS, where close to 50 health trusts were believed to have been affected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last month theBritish Chambers of Commerce warned that while large businesses are more likely to become the victim of an attack than their smaller counterparts, all types of companies need to ramp up security defences.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">British&nbsp;companies risk being forced out of business by new EU-wide data laws that will leave ill-prepared businesses exposed to multi-billion pound fines, research shows.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) next year will require businesses across the bloc to take extra steps to protect customer data and be more transparent about how it is used.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With less than a year until the rules take effect next May, just a third of UK companies have started preparing for the shake-up, while 60pc were completely unaware of the rules, according to a survey commissioned by law firm Irwin Mitchell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The YouGov poll of 2,000 businesses also showed that 71pc were unaware of the harsher penalties that could be enforced, with a maximum financial penalty of (EURO)20m (&pound;17.5m) - or 4pc of global turnover. This comes despite 18pc respondents stating they would go out of business if they received the maximum punishment, while one in ten said they would need to make &quot;significant&quot; job cuts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joanne Bone, a partner at Irwin Mitchell, said: &quot;May's deadline is fast-approaching and with so much at stake, our study reveals there's a very real possibility that the majority of organisations will not be compliant in time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new rules, which come into force a year before the UK leaves the EU, state that businesses will have to report data breaches within 72 hours to regulators where there is an impact on privacy, such as a customer database being hacked. The sweeping rules encompass a wide range of personal information including employee, payroll and pension data, and will also apply to sole-traders and partnerships.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, a third of businesses surveyed believed the rules would not apply to them, while a quarter said they would not be able to detect a breach.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Get used to this jumble of letters: GDPR. They stand for the new law that will give us back a measure of control over our personal data online and impose massive fines on companies that stand in our way or fail to protect it. In the tug-of-war over personal data between companies and their customers, the new regulation falls firmly in the consumer's favour. But it also offers huge benefits for companies too, if they play it right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GDPR - it stands for general data protection regulation - comes into force a year tomorrow and will allow European consumers to ask companies to show them the personal data gathered on them and to explain why it is collected and how it is being used. It provides a crucial reminder to consumers of the value of the information that they have got used to giving away for nothing.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although this is European Union legislation, the government has confirmed that it will be implemented here, despite Brexit. It also applies to non-EU organisations that offer goods or services to individuals in Europe, so will also cover the American technology groups that have been hoovering up our personal data for years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For breaches, firms will have to pay fines of 2 to 4 per cent of their global annual turnover, or (EURO)20 million, whichever is the greater. That could represent an effective deterrent. Talktalk's 2016 fine of &pound;400,000 for security failings that allowed a data breach could have been as high as &pound;37 million under the GDPR. A company such as Facebook, fined (EURO)150,000 in France last week for data mishandling, could face penalties as high as (EURO)500 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many British businesses have said they are not fully prepared to deliver the law. As Greg Day of Palo Alto Networks, an enterprise security firm, notes, some fear that it is not prescriptive enough. One big concern surrounds a requirement for them to report certain types of data breach to regulators and, in some cases, to customers. Some fear that the regulations may encourage companies to delay notification because the rules require them to first determine whether any of a string of potential exemptions apply.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Talktalk has said that in the case of its breach it wouldn't have been clear for months whether exemptions applied, because that calculation depended on information not immediately available. Customers could be left vulnerable during the interim, while companies could be encouraged to handle breaches in a way that met exemptions, rather than to prioritise customer protection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GDPR also gives customers the right to ask one company to &quot;port&quot; all the data they have built up on them over the years, to a rival provider, effectively enabling firms to poach each other's data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chris McMillan, a partner at Oliver Wyman, the consultancy, says that many firms may not be able to cope with the business consequences of losing their data banks in this way. But he also sees new business opportunities. It's only a matter of time, he believes, before big tech firms launch &quot;data passport&quot; services, seeking customers' permission to store in one place all their personal data from different sources. They could then monetise this treasure trove by shopping around for the best deals on insurance, utilities or whatever, based on a highly detailed view of a user's habits and preferences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For all its faults, GDPR represents a huge opportunity. Crucially, it will force businesses to step back and examine the processes they have put in place throughout the time of enormous technological change since Britain's privacy laws were last updated with the 1998 Data Protection Act and question whether they can do better. They almost certainly can.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An open letter to George Freeman MP, chairman of the government's policy board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dear George, as a former biotech venture capitalist, you are a passionate champion of innovation. It has pulled an average of 137,000 people out of extreme poverty each and every day of the past 25 years. It's the only thing that can pay off our &pound;1.9 trillion national debt while keeping our grandchildren prosperous. You are on record as saying: &quot;We have a once-in-a-generation chance to seize the opportunities to make the UK the innovation capital of the world, defying the doubters and being clear that we will go on leading the world in science and technology.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I don't know what it is like down your end of the parliamentary corridor, but at ours we spend very little time talking about how to encourage and reward innovation, despite its clear importance. We are too busy instead with regulation and spending. Although it hardly features in debates or coverage of British politics, there is an entrepreneurial revolution going on in Britain, with about 600,000 business start-ups a year, more than in any other European country - driven by some excellent pro-enterprise policies started under David Cameron.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, most of this is in the digital economy, where innovation is comparatively &quot;permissionless&quot; - for now. Elsewhere, there is a real problem with bad, inconsistent or burdensome regulation stifling innovation. So here is a suggestion for the Conservative Party manifesto that I think could help unleash beneficial innovation in years to come, or at least prevent it grinding to a halt. It is called the innovation principle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was proposed by the European Risk Forum and is actively supported by BusinessEurope and the European Round Table of Industrialists. In essence, it says: examine every policy, plan or political strategy for the impact it could have on innovation, and if you find evidence that the policy is going to impede it, then drop, change or rethink the thing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Twenty-two chief executives from some of the world's more innovative companies signed a letter to Jean-Claude Juncker in 2014 asking him to adopt the innovation principle, and the Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, endorsed it last year during his country's presidency of the EU, saying: &quot;I particularly support ... the innovation principle. This principle requires assessing - as standard - the impact of proposed new legislation on innovation. In my view, we should position the innovation principle more prominently in the years ahead, to make the EU economy stronger and more agile.&quot; So there is a chance that the European Union will get the point, and remember Britain tends to overapply regulations anyway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The innovation principle would complement rather than replace the precautionary principle, which is incorporated into the Lisbon treaty. At its best the precautionary principle is a good thing, preventing future thalidomide tragedies. It says: think about the risks before you adopt something new. At its worst, it does huge harm, because it says: banish potential hazards without considering the benefits of an innovation, while ignoring the hazards of an existing technology, and therefore don't do anything new.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, European certification of genetically modified crops is so impossibly slow, uncertain and politicised as to have frightened off all applications in recent years. The result is that Europe has missed out on the organic, insect-resistant &quot;Bt&quot; revolution in plant breeding and is far more reliant on pesticides instead. The newer technology of gene editing, which is being pioneered in British laboratories, has been given a green light by US regulators, while the EU has - get this - asked member states to avoid making a decision at all. What signal does that send? One chemical manufacturer tells me he estimates that to develop a new herbicide that could safely tackle black-grass, an increasingly problematic weed, it would be necessary to comply with between 15,000 and 40,000 pages of regulations and scientific guidance documents. Few companies in the world have this capability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Next month the implementation of new European rules on vaping arrives, which restrict e-cigarette advertising, limit tank and refill sizes, and cap the strength of liquids, making it harder for this much safer new technology to continue to displace smoking at a rate of knots. Thus, in the name of the precautionary principle, the EU has been insisting on danger. Last December, BusinessEurope produced a long catalogue of cases in which EU regulation had affected innovation. The list includes two cases where regulation stimulated innovation (waste policies and sustainable mobility), but far more where it hampered change by introducing legal uncertainty, inconsistency with other regulations, technology-prescriptive rules, burdensome packaging requirements, high compliance costs or excessive precaution. For example, the EU medical devices directive has greatly increased the cost and reduced the supply of new medical devices. Don't take comfort from our many digital start-ups. As a chemical industry executive put it to me last week, the digital industry does not realise what's about to hit it. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) comes into force next year, along with new ePrivacy regulation. The British Information Commissioner's Office has issued draft guidance that gold-plates the GDPR, with an unduly strict and burdensome interpretation that tilts the balance against the data industry in a manner not required by the regulation. Its proposed rules on opt-outs and consents would make direct marketing as presently practised here impossible. Data analysis is a growing industry in which we have the potential to be a world leader.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An abstract principle, however pious, is not going to change anything. The only way to get momentum for reform is to create a vested interest, preferably with a budget. Precaution has a wealthy constituency in the vast green lobby, whereas innovation's benefits are dispersed among consumers. So here's a suggestion. Why not pledge to set up an innovation commission, guided by the innovation principle, whose job is to examine policies and report on their likely impact on innovation? New Zealand has tried something similar, a productivity commission, which &quot;considers whether laws, policies, regulations and institutions best support the wellbeing of New Zealanders&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Without this, we will be in the economic slow lane, which will hamper our ability to generate funds for social welfare, defence, foreign aid, education and everything else.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yours optimistically, Matt.</SPAN></P>

The result is that Europe has missed out on the organic, insect-resistant &quot;Bt&quot; revolution in plant breeding and is far more reliant on pesticides instead. The newer technology of gene editing, which is being pioneered in British laboratories, has been given a green light by US regulators, while the EU has - get this - asked member states to avoid making a decision at all. What signal does that send? One chemical manufacturer tells me he estimates that to develop a new herbicide that could safely tackle black-grass, an increasingly problematic weed, it would be necessary to comply with between 15,000 and 40,000 pages of regulations and scientific guidance documents. Few companies in the world have this capability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Next month the implementation of new European rules on vaping arrives, which restrict e-cigarette advertising, limit tank and refill sizes, and cap the strength of liquids, making it harder for this much safer new technology to continue to displace smoking at a rate of knots. Thus, in the name of the precautionary principle, the EU has been insisting on danger. Last December, BusinessEurope produced a long catalogue of cases in which EU regulation had affected innovation. The list includes two cases where regulation stimulated innovation (waste policies and sustainable mobility), but far more where it hampered change by introducing legal uncertainty, inconsistency with other regulations, technology-prescriptive rules, burdensome packaging requirements, high compliance costs or excessive precaution. For example, the EU medical devices directive has greatly increased the cost and reduced the supply of new medical devices. Don't take comfort from our many digital start-ups. As a chemical industry executive put it to me last week, the digital industry does not realise what's about to hit it. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) comes into force next year, along with new ePrivacy regulation. The British Information Commissioner's Office has issued draft guidance that gold-plates the GDPR, with an unduly strict and burdensome interpretation that tilts the balance against the data industry in a manner not required by the regulation. Its proposed rules on opt-outs and consents would make direct marketing as presently practised here impossible. Data analysis is a growing industry in which we have the potential to be a world leader.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An abstract principle, however pious, is not going to change anything. The only way to get momentum for reform is to create a vested interest, preferably with a budget. Precaution has a wealthy constituency in the vast green lobby, whereas innovation's benefits are dispersed among consumers. So here's a suggestion. Why not pledge to set up an innovation commission, guided by the innovation principle, whose job is to examine policies and report on their likely impact on innovation? New Zealand has tried something similar, a productivity commission, which &quot;considers whether laws, policies, regulations and institutions best support the wellbeing of New Zealanders&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Without this, we will be in the economic slow lane, which will hamper our ability to generate funds for social welfare, defence, foreign aid, education and everything else.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An open letter to George Freeman MP, chairman of the government's policy board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dear George, as a former biotech venture capitalist, you are a passionate champion of innovation. It has pulled an average of 137,000 people out of extreme poverty each and every day of the past 25 years. It's the only thing that can pay off our &pound;1.9 trillion national debt while keeping our grandchildren prosperous. You are on record as saying: &quot;We have a once-in-a-generation chance to seize the opportunities to make the UK the innovation capital of the world, defying the doubters and being clear that we will go on leading the world in science and technology.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I don't know what it is like down your end of the parliamentary corridor, but at ours we spend very little time talking about how to encourage and reward innovation, despite its clear importance. We are too busy instead with regulation and spending. Although it hardly features in debates or coverage of British politics, there is an entrepreneurial revolution going on in Britain, with about 600,000 business start-ups a year, more than in any other European country - driven by some excellent pro-enterprise policies started under David Cameron.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, most of this is in the digital economy, where innovation is comparatively &quot;permissionless&quot; - for now. Elsewhere, there is a real problem with bad, inconsistent or burdensome regulation stifling innovation. So here is a suggestion for the Conservative Party manifesto that I think could help unleash beneficial innovation in years to come, or at least prevent it grinding to a halt. It is called the innovation principle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was proposed by the European Risk Forum and is actively supported by BusinessEurope and the European Round Table of Industrialists. In essence, it says: examine every policy, plan or political strategy for the impact it could have on innovation, and if you find evidence that the policy is going to impede it, then drop, change or rethink the thing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Twenty-two chief executives from some of the world's more innovative companies signed a letter to Jean-Claude Juncker in 2014 asking him to adopt the innovation principle, and the Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, endorsed it last year during his country's presidency of the EU, saying: &quot;I particularly support ... the innovation principle. This principle requires assessing - as standard - the impact of proposed new legislation on innovation. In my view, we should position the innovation principle more prominently in the years ahead, to make the EU economy stronger and more agile.&quot; So there is a chance that the European Union will get the point, and remember Britain tends to overapply regulations anyway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The innovation principle would complement rather than replace the precautionary principle, which is incorporated into the Lisbon treaty. At its best the precautionary principle is a good thing, preventing future thalidomide tragedies. It says: think about the risks before you adopt something new. At its worst, it does huge harm, because it says: banish potential hazards without considering the benefits of an innovation, while ignoring the hazards of an existing technology, and therefore don't do anything new.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, European certification of genetically modified crops is so impossibly slow, uncertain and politicised as to have frightened off all applications in recent years.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the full specs of phone will not be made public until a week before it is unveiled - which is later this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McAfee plans to release the phone later this year through MGT, reported Anthony Cuthbertson with Newsweek, who conducted an exclusive interview with the computer expert and businessman.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'The smartphone contains a bank of switches on the back cover that allow the user to physically disconnect the battery, the antennas for WiFi, Bluetooth and geolocation, the camera and the microphone,' McAfee said during an interview with Newsweek.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'It also will not allow the phone to connect to a Stingray or any other IMSI catcher device. In addition, it contains a web search anonymizer.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MGT shared a press release last month, revealing it had signed a letter of intent with Nordic IT Sourcing Association to design, test and assemble a state of the art cell phone with privacy features that stay one step ahead of hackers and eavesdroppers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We are honored to be working with cybersecurity pioneer John McAfee and his team. MGT's innovative ideas should result in a unique offering in mobile communications, said Alexander Reay, president of Nordic IT.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We have been heavily involved in the research of security and privacy issues, both in the Nordics and with our partners worldwide.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'With the new GDPR regulations here in Europe set to take effect in 2018 and recent leaks, there is no end to the privacy issues facing enterprises and society as a whole.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We strongly believe that such a device will be the center of attention for both privacy concerned consumers, and corporate leaders looking to develop a winning strategic cybersecurity and privacy program on behalf of their company.'&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the release, the 'phone will be procured as an OEM model using the Android operating system, and then modified using the skills of MGT's cybersecurity team.'</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to John McAfee, AI is a 'self-conscious entity' that is inherently self-interested, which could give rise to conflict with the human species.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cybersecurity expert argues that any system created by humans would be flawed by nature - and, ultimately, the AI's goal would include the 'necessary destruction of its creator.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the novella - which blatantly alludes to the debate on artificial intelligence today, with opposing forces named 'Demis' and 'Elon' - a particular passage describes an advanced system that can hack itself to 'improve efficiency and logic,' McAfee explains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Such a concept is certainly not new and typical hacking techniques in use today can easily be imagined to be self-produced by complex software systems,' McAfee wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'It would, in fact, be trivial to create such a system.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite strides in cybersecurity, the expert says any imaginable logical system can be hacked - and, this becomes more certain as these structures become more complex.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is because there is no system that exists that does not have a defect, according to McAfee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But MGT's first lot production would include 16,000 units at $350 per unit.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Smartphones have become the Achilles heel of cybersecurity,' said McAfee, who is also the executive chairman and CEO of MGT.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'No matter how secure our applications become, they must still execute in an environment designed from ground up to be a spy device.</SPAN></P>

In March this year, the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) issued one of its highest fines to a Hampshire company that had made over 22m nuisance calls. The company in question was fined (pdf) &pound;270,000. In its defence, it claimed it purchased data from a number of different third party providers and that the data had been screened against the Telephone Preference Service and it was all &quot;opt-in&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the ICO rightly took a dim view of this, it's easy to see why it can happen. Just about everything we sign-up for now asks for names, numbers and email addresses and unless we read the terms and conditions (Ts and Cs) carefully, we have no idea where that data will end up. Free apps, free wifi, loyalty cards and even paid-for services such as mobile phone contracts harvest our data and either sell it or make it available via technology sharing deals.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Amazon Kindle's terms 'unreasonable' and would take nine hours to read, Choice says</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's hardly surprising, given the length and complexity of most business privacy statements. Australian advocacy group Choice recently highlighted the problem by getting an actor to read Amazon Kindle's 73,198 word Ts and Cs. It took nine hours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Stephanie Hankey, co-founder and executive director of the Tactical Technology Collective - whose Data Detox Kit helps concerned consumers clean-up online footprints - this is typical of the issues facing technology users who are consistently confronted with &quot;meaningless and inaccessible&quot; Ts and Cs, but it's just the tip of the iceberg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Unlike service delivery data [such as location for Google Maps], sometimes metadata and content data is collected as part of the business model by the company and sold,&quot; says Hankey. &quot;There have been quite a few cases of 'overreach' here. For example, the flashlight app that was collecting your address book data. Clearly not needed to give you light.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Sir Tim Berners-Lee, data control is one of three key challenges facing the future of the internet. As we digitise all aspects of our lives and leave often incredibly detailed footprints online, how do we ensure our information is safe? Who can we trust? Facebook?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The social media site recently updated its privacy policy saying data can no longer be used by developers for surveillance tools. While on the surface this may seem like an honourable move, how will it be policed? Is it just a case of trusting Facebook with what is, according to Hankey, &quot;a perfect tool for surveillance, with or without the collaboration of developers&quot;?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Berners-Lee's answer is to decouple data from websites, including social networks. Solid is an MIT project started in January this year and led by Berners-Lee, offering &quot;a proposed set of conventions and tools for building decentralised social applications based on linked data principles,&quot; according to the site. It's too early to tell how successful this will be, but you get the feeling it's going to be tough going.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another site which is looking to redress the balance is Datacoup, a marketplace for people to sell their own data and make money. CEO and co-founder Matt Hogan says the site has &quot;many users who've earned triple digits on selling their data,&quot; although for the moment at least, this has been to Datacoup. The company is &quot;lining up sustainable purchasers now,&quot; says Hogan, whose real beef is with the third-party data brokers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Mapping the brain with open data</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These are B2B companies, yet they are selling consumer assets. Something is clearly askew there,&quot; he says. &quot;How could a company that I have no relationship, no touch-points with accumulate so much information about me? They'd have to have done so surreptitiously.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Martijn Verbree, partner at KPMG's cyber security practice, efforts to return ownership to consumers are &quot;noble but tough to do,&quot;, adding that to a large extent, the horse has already bolted. He points instead to regulation and in particular the EU's forthcoming General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The ICO is currently undergoing a consultation on the format and implementation of the regulation, to be applied in May 2018.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;GDPR brings a big stick,&quot; says Verbree, &quot;with fines up to 4% of group revenue or (EURO)20m, whichever is more. Under current Data Protection Act regulations, the maximum fine is &pound;500,000. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While not everyone is totally enamoured with the regulation, or at least the UK's ability to implement a sufficiently robust version post-Brexit, (see Amberhawk Training's blog on transfers of personal data after a hard Brexit), for the foreseeable future, it is the biggest weapon against corporate misuse of personal data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Alan Duric, co-founder and CTO at Wire, not harvesting consumer data and selling it on has become a unique selling point. Based in Switzerland, the business which offers a video, voice, text and social sharing communications application prides itself on being open source, transparent and having &quot;no ads, no profiling and full end-to-end encryption.&quot; Wire apparently only stores user data for a maximum of 72-hours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It goes against the grain, but doesn't really undermine the idea that personal data is &quot;the new gold&quot;. There are too many apps and businesses with vested interests to change the course of data trading. Stiffer penalties will no doubt help but it is user education that will be most effective in the fight against lost data ownership. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spare a thought for 7,500 online shoppers from 2010, when former games retailer Gamestation claimed to have gained their souls thanks to a clause inserted into its Ts and Cs for April Fool's Day. If you don't read the small print, who knows what you are giving away?</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TECH industry bosses are expressing growing concerns over the &quot;significant challenges&quot; that Britain faces if it is to maintain free flows of data with the European Union after Brexit.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That was the message when ministers met the leaders of 23 national technology industry associations during a closed-door summit held in London earlier this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The gathering was intended to air industry concerns over the legal, technical and bureaucratic obstacles thrown up by the UK leaving the EU. And chief among the fears raised was that Whitehall has still not grasped the mammoth jurisdictional challenges thrown up by Brexit - when Britain, as an outsider, will have to satisfy EU data privacy concerns all over again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is a big question about what that robust legal basis looks like and there are significant challenges afoot,&quot; said Charlotte Holloway, the policy director at TechUK, the leading industry umbrella group and the summit's primary organisers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Government has committed to implementing the new EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) which comes into force in May 2018, but this may still not be sufficient for the UK to be given a clean bill of health by the EU after Brexit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a third country, outside the EU, the UK will need to obtain a ruling from Brussels that its data protection regimes are &quot;essentially equivalent&quot; to those applied within the EU in order to keep data flowing across borders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As an EU member, Britain's security and spying apparatus was exempt from that equivalence evaluation, but as a third country it will have to demonstrate that EU citizens' rights are adequately protected, despite the UK's more permissive attitude to spying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senior EU sources in Brussels privately acknowledge that the UK's Investigatory Powers Act (2016), popularly known as the &quot;Snoopers Charter&quot;, risks making it far harder for Britain to satisfy European concerns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The British have led the way on open data for years, but the Act erases decades of British leadership in this area,&quot; the source said, acknowledging that Britain's close links with US intelligence would also be &quot;in the background&quot; of any assessment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With an estimated 12pc of global data flows passing through the UK, according to a Tech UK assessment, the costs of not having a working regime in place on the day of Brexit are potentially massive, according to industry experts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Matt Hancock, the digital and culture minister, told the House of Lords last month that the UK is &quot;keen to ensure&quot; that data flows remain &quot;unhindered&quot; after Brexit, but he declined to provide details about the UK negotiation strategy on this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is growing trepidation within the industry that the Government has underestimated the difficulties of obtaining the EU equivalent declaration - a process that requires deep cross government co-ordination and which overran by a year in the US privacy shield negotiations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The appointment of a UK ombudsman for EU citizens to raise fears over data privacy, a joined-up government approach, and bold transparency from the British intelligence apparatus, would all smooth the path to a deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Britain will need to prove that its protection levels are equal to that applied in the EU for data to keep coming</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UK's data watchdog is planning to hire hundreds more staff to enforce a strict new regime that will&nbsp; crack&nbsp;down on the mishandling of consumers' personal information.&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Information Commissioner's Office will expand its roster of investigators, lawyers, analysts and policy advisors by 40pc in the next two years as it prepares for the country to adopt a &quot;once in a generation change in the law&quot;. It will mean around 200 new staff joining the watchdog.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Brussels' new data protection laws, which the UK plans to adopt despite Brexit,&nbsp;will hand the regulator the power to force companies to obtain clear consent before processing citizens' data. It will also enforce mandatory disclosures for companies that&nbsp;suffer a data breach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Added to the ICO's&nbsp;arsenal will be the ability to&nbsp;impose fines of up to (EURO)20 million (&pound;17.4m)&nbsp;or 4pc of global turnover for breaches, whether they are&nbsp;from human error or a cyber attack. At the moment its maximum penalty is &pound;500,000. &nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elizabeth Denham, information commissioner, said the watchdog&nbsp;is currently understaffed and needs more resources to deal with the upcoming regulation. &nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Almost every regulator would say that he or she doesn't have sufficient resources,&quot; Ms Denham told a House of Lords committee. &quot;I have approximately 500 people that support me in my adjudicative and education functions across the United Kingdom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;With the coming of the General Data Protection Regulation we will have more responsibilities, we will have new enforcement powers. So we are putting in new measures to be able to address our new regulatory powers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have given the government an estimate that we will need a further 200 people in order to be able to do the job.&quot;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Information Commissioner Elizabeth DenhamCredit:      Gov.uk     </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Denham, speaking to a House of Lords committee last week, also urged the Government to establish an interim data sharing agreement with the European Union to ensure information can continue to flow as soon as the country leaves. Experts have warned that even if the UK adopts the GDPR the Investigatory Powers Act could threaten this.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We can't have people throwing rocks at us from the outside, we have to have a very strong regime here, which is well enforced,&quot; said Ms Denham.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Weakening the law, making it so-called less burdensome on business may seem attractive when you look at it on the surface but I don't think a sustainable model is a lowering of data protection regulation and practice. That's really going to bite us in the long term.&quot;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She added that the UK watchdog will increasingly work with data protection offices beyond Europe with a long term goal of lobbying for an international treaty on standards.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokesman for the ICO said:&nbsp;&quot;In May 2018 new laws come into force to better protect people's privacy in the digital age and ensure organisations who handle personal information get it right. That brings significant additional responsibilities for the ICO as the UK's data protection regulator.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As if we didn't know it already, last year's alleged hacking of the US election and some large-scale corporate security breaches revealed just how flimsy defences can be in the face of adept cybercriminals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Juniper Research, data breaches will cost businesses $2.1 trillion worldwide by 2019. And challenges mount as laws tighten, companies grow increasingly reliant on complex technology and fresh chinks in security pop up. Hackers even broke into US discount store chain Target in 2014 to steal financial details through the internet-connected air-conditioning system. Companies and governments need online security like never before.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With a huge skills gap - the sector will be short of some 1.5 million people by the end of 2019 according to industry body (ISC)2 - demand in the UK will outstrip workforce supply for the next 20 years. A Cisco report, Mitigating the cybersecurity skills shortage, estimates there are currently more than one million unfilled security jobs worldwide. But ask a non-techie whether they fancy cybersecurity as a career, and the chances are most of them will have ruled themselves out as unskilled or ill-equipped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of us don't really understand what the sector needs. &quot;I don't have a deep technical background,&quot; writes Debbie W on a government security blog. &quot;I never planned a career in cybersecurity. But I'm good at it.&quot; She works at the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), part of government intelligence agency GCHQ and an authority on cybersecurity. &quot;People are the most underused resource in cybersecurity,&quot; said Dr Ian Levy, technical director at NCSC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But what - or who - does the burgeoning sector require? &quot;People from different backgrounds, those with strong logic and problem solving skills,&quot; says Peter Wood, chief executive of ethical hacking firm First Base Technologies. &quot;Anyone with a good brain and a sharp mind can find a role.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But both the Government and business know they need to train up promising recruits, as not enough students are coming through with the right technical skills, and women are few and far between. CyberFirst, a new Government scheme, has offered bursaries to increase numbers of science undergraduates since 2015.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While different backgrounds have a part to play, the sector does need computer science at the core,&quot; says Chris Ensor, the Government's deputy director for cybersecurity skills and growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Naturally companies welcome computer science graduates and postgraduates with the right mindset and qualifications with open arms, although universities have to work hard to keep their courses up to date. Those such as Birmingham, Abertay, Royal Holloway and many more offer respected Masters in cybersecurity. New accredited training schemes have been beefed up by the likes of the Government and the BBC, professional services firms offer cybersecurity apprenticeships and those offered by GCHQ include a high proportion of structured education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A free intensive 10-week boot camp in cybersecurity is offered by the Cyber Retraining Academy. But candidates need to understand the breadth of roles, says Mr Wood, from the deeply technical to those requiring healthy communication skills. Computer scientists are needed to design an organisation's security defences. But those responsible for creating a company's strategy and writing security policies will also need a strong business background.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More roles exist within threat management - understanding what and where attacks might come from or how to repair and respond to breaches. And new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) coming into force in Europe in 2018 will place tougher penalties for breaches within companies, so demand for these skills is acute Ethical hacking - legally but sometimes covertly testing an organisation's defences - has great appeal. In some cases you might masquerade as an employee. &quot;It's like breaking the law with permission,&quot; says Mr Wood. &quot;Most cyber-attacks include an element of tricking people to find a way in.&quot; Another growth area is staff training. &quot;Technical controls alone can't prevent people from giving away a password,&quot; he adds. &quot;Staff need to be made aware.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But more could be done by industry to appeal to those who think they can't work in the sector just because they don't code, says Martyn Ruks, group technical director at MWR InfoSecurity. &quot;Finding people with problem solving skills, an analytical brain and an inquisitive nature is still a problem,&quot; he says. He suggests that anyone interested attends hack events, online competitions and industry conferences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's such a broad spectrum,&quot; says Mr Ensor. &quot;There are so many opportunities for different aptitudes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE FIVE WORST CYBER-HACKS 1 In 2011, hackers broke into a weakness in Sony's network to steal information from 100 million user accounts 2 Last year, details of more than 117 million LinkedIn accounts were being traded on the darknet, allegedly sourced from a cyber attack in 2012 3 In 2014 the Heartbleed bug was discovered online, where it may have been allowing hackers to steal personal information for two years undetected 4 Hackers leaked names and contact details of 22,000 FBI employees in February 2016, one day after posting similar details on almost 10,000 employees from the Department of Homeland Security 5 Yahoo revealed two historic massive data breaches in 2016. In 2014, half a billion Yahoo users had their names, addresses and passwords stolen and in a second, in 2013, more than one billion users were affected</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cambridge University's 300-year-old tradition of publishing &quot;class lists&quot; could be banned under EU law, despite students voting to keep them in the face of criticism of the &quot;snowflake generation&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lists - where students' names are displayed alongside their degree grade on a board outside the university's main building Senate House - are likely to be deemed illegal under new data protection laws which will come into force next year. &nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Student campaigners had argued that class lists were &quot;damaging&quot; to welfare, triggered depression and &quot;promoting a culture of shaming&quot;,  but a referendum in November saw 55 per cent of students vote to keep the class lists, albeit with a simplified opt-out process.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The term &quot;snowflake generation&quot; was one of Collins Dictionary's 2016 words of the year. Collins defines the term as &quot;the young adults of the 2010s, viewed as being less resilient and more prone to taking offence than previous generations&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now the tradition is under fresh threat from new EU laws which place greater emphasis on &quot;active consent&quot; of subjects, rather than presumed consent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), due to come into effect in May 2018, students may be required to give explicit permission for their grades to be published. Cambridge University is understood to have sought legal advice on how to proceed.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minutes from the General Board Education Committee, seen by the Daily Telegraph, reveal that the university's concern that the new laws would require a &quot;considerable shift from the current procedures&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Professor Graham Virgo, the university's Pro Vice Chancellor for Education, told the Committee that it has &quot;recently become apparent that new Data Protection legislation, which would come into force in May 2018, would place greater emphasis on active consent being sought from data subjects for data collection and use, and it had been suggested that moving to an opt-in system for publication of class lists might consequently be necessary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A move to an opt-in system would be a considerable shift from the current procedures that allowed students to opt-out only in certain prescribed circumstances.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Information Commissioner's Office said that the UK's decision to leave the EU &quot;will not affect the commencement of the GDPR&quot;. &nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Cambridge University spokesman said: &quot;Under new Data Protection legislation, which is due to come into force in May 2018, greater emphasis is placed on an individual's right to choose how their data is collected and used, and on an organisation's responsibility to reflect this in its policies and procedures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The University is currently considering the potential effects of this legislation - including the possibility that the public display of class lists may change to an opt-in system - but no decisions have yet been made.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opposites attract. Today, the brash, opinionated and protectionist new president of the United States, Donald Trump, will meet the cautious Theresa May, who last week at Davos expounded the virtues of free trade. But while Mrs May's desire to make the UK a global trade leader is admirable and economically right, this trade focus must not come at the expense of making the most of Brexit at home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That requires reassessing the host of regulations repatriated when we leave the single market. For all the talk of international trade, a key advantage of Brexit is that deregulation can be used to boost internal trade and lower costs.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Government is set to transcribe all existing EU laws and regulation into UK law through its Great Repeal Bill. This is sensible to avoid cliffedges for business. But to focus the minds in taming the regulatory state, a sunset clause should be applied to all existing EU regulation such that if it remains unjustified after 10 years, it dies. In the meantime, Parliament should get to work on a host of uncontroversial areas. It is widely acknowledged that the EU's Common Agricultural Policy causes significant economic damage, raising food prices for consumers and inefficiently distributing funds. Less widely known is the damage it does to agricultural innovation in areas such as GM and pesticide use, where stringent regulations lower crop yields and deter innovation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A UK path to abolition for agricultural protectionism and a move away from the EU's precautionary principle could completely modernise the sector. New Zealand in the Eighties showed how this type of liberalisation can enhance productivity. Andrea Leadsom, the Environment Secretary, has already pledged to abolish the EU's &quot;threecrop rule&quot;. Hopefully, this is just the start.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Common Fisheries Policy will need a similar overhaul, with the most important question being how to allocate initial permits. The evidence suggests that to marry economic with environmental incentives, any quotas in the form of permits should be allocated &quot;in perpetuity&quot;, so that fishermen seek to maximise the value of their quota over an infinite time horizon (and hence not overfish in any given year).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's not just in agriculture and food that regulatory revision and innovation is needed. For the burgeoning digital economy sector, repealing regulations such as the EU's general data protection regulation (GDPR) would encouraging entrepreneurial activity by removing the risk of punitive fines for datahandling mistakes. Britain can revive its previous world-leading clinical trials industry by overturning the Clinical Trials Directive, which academic research has suggested has doubled the costs of running noncommercial trials. Britain will also finally be able to revise the Working Time Directive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In every other field, from insurance to transport, Britain has an opportunity to shape regulations towards its own needs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All this is not to mention the energy sector and climate change policy, where the EU has set unrealistic emissions targets with mandates favouring expensive renewables, and directives which have led to the closure of oil and coal-fired power stations. Of course, Britain has gone along with, and even led the way in, much of this agenda. But Mrs May seems more sceptical of past policy, and with President Trump seemingly tearing up the consensus in this area, Britain could follow suit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, it would be churlish to suggest that heavy-handed regulation was uniquely a feature of the EU.British land-use planning laws are the most damaging supply-side drag on the economy, and by restricting building have structurally raised house prices by as much as 40 per cent. The Tories have added huge burdens on small businesses with auto-enrolment and the National Living Wage. Any attempt to comprehensively deregulate would require a review of all domestic regulations, too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brexit, however, could be the catalyst needed - not least because it brings so many previously untouchable areas back into play. In the US, Mr Trump yesterday declared war on the regulatory state &quot;big-time&quot;. If Mrs May follows suit, it could provide a significant boost to Britain's already booming post-Brexit economy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An artificial intelligence watchdog should be set up to make sure people are not discriminated against by the automated computer systems making important decisions about their lives, say experts. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has led to an explosion in the number of algorithms that are used by employers, banks, police forces and others, but the systems can, and do, make bad decisions that seriously impact people's lives. But because technology companies are so secretive about how their algorithms work - to prevent other firms from copying them - they rarely disclose any detailed information about how AIs have made particular decisions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Discrimination by algorithm: scientists devise test to detect AI bias</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a new report, Sandra Wachter, Brent Mittelstadt, and Luciano Floridi, a research team at the Alan Turing Institute in London and the University of Oxford, call for a trusted third party body that can investigate AI decisions for people who believe they have been discriminated against. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What we'd like to see is a trusted third party, perhaps a regulatory or supervisory body, that would have the power to scrutinise and audit algorithms, so they could go in and see whether the system is actually transparent and fair,&quot; said Wachter. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is not a new problem. Back in the 1980s, an algorithm used to sift student applications at St George's Hospital Medial School in London was found to discriminate against women and people with non-European-looking names. More recently, a veteran American Airlines pilot described how he had been detained at airports on 80 separate occasions after an algorithm repeatedly confused him with an IRA leader. Others to fall foul of AI errors have lost their jobs, had car licences revoked, been kicked off the electoral register or mistakenly chased for child support bills.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People who find themselves on the wrong end of a flawed AI can challenge the decision under national laws - but the report finds that the current laws to protect people are not now effective enough. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Britain, the Data Protection Act allows automated decisions to be challenged. But UK firms, in common with those in other countries, do not have to release any information they consider a trade secret. In practice, this means that instead of releasing a full explanation for a specific AI decision, a company can simply describe how the algorithm works. For example, a person turned down for a credit card might be told that the algorithm took their credit history, age, and postcode into account, but not learn why their application was rejected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2018, European member states, along with Britain, will adopt new legislation that governs how AIs can be challenged. Early drafts of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) enshrined what is called a &quot;right to explanation&quot; in law. But the authors argue that the final version approved last year contains no legal guarantee. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  'I think my blackness is interfering': does facial recognition show racial bias?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is an idea that the GDPR will deliver accountability and transparency for AI, but that's not at all guaranteed. It all depends on how it is interpreted in the future by national and European courts,&quot; Mittelstadt said. The best the new regulation offers is a &quot;right to be informed&quot; compelling companies to reveal the purpose of an algorithm, the kinds of data it draws on to make its decisions, and other basic information. In their paper, the researchers argue for the regulation to be amended to make the &quot;right to explanation&quot; legally binding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are already too dependent on algorithms to give up the right to question their decisions,&quot; said Floridi. &quot;The GDPR should be improved to ensure that such a right is fully and unambiguously supported&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the study, the authors reviewed legal cases in Austria and Germany which have some of the stricter laws around decision-taking algorithms. In many cases, they found that courts required companies to release only the most general information about the decisions algorithms had made. &quot;They didn't need to disclose any details about the algorithm itself and no details whatsoever about your individual decision or how it was reached based on your data,&quot; Wachter said. A trusted third party, she added, could balance companies' concerns over trade secrets with the right for people to be satisfied that a decision had been reached fairly. &quot;If the algorithms can really affect people's lives, we need some kind of scrutiny so we can see how an algorithm actually reached a decision,&quot; she added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But even if a AI watchdog were set up, it may find it hard to police algorithms. &quot;It's not entirely clear how to properly equip a watchdog to do the job, simply because we are often talking about very complex systems that are unpredictable, change over time and are difficult to understand, even for the teams developing them,&quot; Mittelstadt said. He adds that forcing companies to ensure their AIs can explain themselves could trigger protests, because some modern AI methods, such as deep learning, are &quot;fundamentally inscrutable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alan Winfield, professor of robot ethics at the University of the West of England, is heading up a project to develop industry standards for AIs that aims to make them transparent and so more accountable. &quot;A watchdog is a very good proposal,&quot; he said. &quot;This is not a future problem, it's here and now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Related:  Do no harm, don't discriminate: official guidance issued on robot ethics</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he agreed that tech firms might struggle to explain their AI's decisions. Algorithms, especially those based on deep learning techniques, can be so opaque that it is practically impossible to explain how they reach decisions. &quot;My challenge to the likes of Google's DeepMind is to invent a deep learning system that can explain itself,&quot; Winfield said. &quot;It could be hard, but for heaven's sake, there are some pretty bright people working on these systems.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nick Diakopoulos, a computer scientist at the University of Maryland, said that decisions taken by algorithms will need to be explained in different ways depending on what they do. When a self-driving car crashes, for example, it makes sense for the algorithm to explain its decisions to crash investigators, in the same way air traffic investigators have access to aircraft black boxes, he said. But when an algorithm is used in court to advise a judge on sentencing, it may make sense for the judge, the defendant and their legal team to know how the AI arrived at its decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think it is essential to have some kind of regulatory body with legal teeth that can compel transparency around a set of decisions that have led to some kind of error or crash,&quot; Diakopoulos said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   When AI goes awry                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sarah Wysocki, a school teacher in Washington DC, received rave reviews from her students' parents and her principal. But when the city introduced an algorithm in 2009 to assess teacher performance, she and 205 others scored badly and were fired. It turned out that the program had based its decisions on tiny numbers of students' results, and that some other teachers had apparently fooled the system by advising their students to cheat. The school could not explain why excellent teachers had been sacked. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Beauty contest organisers used an algorithm to judge an international event last year. They thought the software would be more objective than humans and pick a winner based on facial symmetry, a lack of wrinkles and other possible measures of beauty. But the system had been trained predominantly on white women and discriminated against dark skin. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Gass, a resident of Natick, Massachusetts, had his driving licence revoked when an antiterrorism facial recognition system mistook him for another driver. It took him ten days to convince authorities that he was who he said he was. He had never been convicted of any driving offences. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                     Microsoft's Tay chatbot was created to strike up conversations with millennials on Twitter. The algorithm had been designed to learn how to mimic others by copying their speech. But within 24 hours of being let loose on the internet, it had been led astray, and became a genocide-supporting, anti-feminist Nazi, tweeting messages such as &quot;HITLER DID NOTHING WRONG.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An automated system designed to catch dads who were not keeping up with childcare payments targeted hundreds of innocent men in Los Angeles who had to pay up or prove their innocence. One man, Walter Vollmer, was sent a bill for more than $200,000. His wife thought he had been leading a secret life and became suicidal. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 1000 people a week are mistakenly flagged up as terrorists by algorithms used at airports. One man, an American Airlines pilot, was detained 80 times over the course of a year because his name was similar to that of an IRA leader. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A 22-year-old Asian DJ was denied a New Zealand passport last year because the automated system that processed his photograph decided that he had his eyes closed. But he was not too put out. &quot;It was a robot, no hard feelings. I got my passport renewed in the end,&quot; he told Reuters.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, it would be churlish to suggest that heavy-handed regulation was uniquely a feature of the EU.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BRITISH companies will be forced to disclose data breaches and face fines worth tens of millions of pounds after the Government cracked down on cyber security and said it would adopt strict European data protection laws in spite of the vote to leave the union.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The adoption and extension of the Brussels data standards, due to come into force in 2018, is a measure seen as crucial to staying in the single market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The EU law, called the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), introduces strict penalties for companies that suffer data breaches, mandates that they must disclose when breaches occur, and forces them to obtain clear consent before processing people's information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Companies will face &quot;more stringent sanctions&quot; and could be fined up to 4pc of global turnover or (EURO)20 million (&pound;16.9 million) for a breach, be it from a cyber attack or human error.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At present, the Information Commissioner's Office can inflict a maximum penalty of &pound;500,000 on companies that fail to adequately protect their customers' information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Matt Hancock, the culture and digital minister, said companies had a responsibility to protect customers' information and that the Government wanted to incentivise strong cyber security. &quot;The upcoming General Data Protection Regulation will be key to ensuring strong organisational data protection regimes supported by strong cyber security,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added that regulation alone was not sufficient and that the Government would also work with companies to improve their security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The news, released as part of a fiveyear cyber security review, disappointed those hoping the UK would not have to adopt GDPR after leaving the EU, or would accept a watered-down version. Instead, the Government will adopt Brussels' measures. &quot;It should ultimately be for organisations to manage their own risk in respect of their own sensitive data, such as intellectual property and online presence,&quot; said the Department of Culture, Media and Sport report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Government warned that companies were not doing enough, in spite of one losing &pound;3 million after a breach. It comes after numerous high-profile cyber attacks, including those against TalkTalk, Three and Yahoo, and the loss of millions of UK customers' details.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The regulation, which critics say is too harsh, will mean businesses must disclose breaches to the data and privacy watchdog, as well as to customers, while some companies will also have to employ data protection officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Experts say the breaches likely to be reported will shock the public, given that the majority of companies now manage incidents without disclosure.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The supporters of an open, democratic internet, funded mainly by advertising, are facing some big questions about how their vision will unfold. A freely accessible digital world, where websites and social networks are open to all, is the dream of many. But critics wonder if this is desirable or even possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brands have shifted a huge proportion of their marketing budgets into online advertising in recent years, fuelling the growth of the internet and becoming the main source of funding for most websites and social networks. But while many campaigns hit the spot, others can be irritating, intrusive and irrelevant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How can advertisers and web publishers make sure ad campaigns are effective and entertaining enough to pay the internet's bills, while ensuring online services don't disappear behind a series of privately accessed paywalls?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To discuss the future of online advertising, the Guardian teamed up with advertising technology provider AppNexus to run a roundtable discussion. The discussion was conducted under the Chatham House Rule, where comments were made on condition that they were not attributed to the speakers, to encourage a free-flowing discussion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A key point of contention in the discussion was how the internet should be funded. One participant was passionate about the ad-funded model: &quot;Largely it should be free. It is a wonderful tool for accessing information, for consuming information and for the distribution of brands.&quot; But another thought that the quality of content on the internet inevitably suffers &quot;unless you have the resources to fund it.&quot; There are fears that ad revenue is insufficient to pay for all the content that is needed for the web. &quot;Generally speaking, the ad-funded model puts a downward pressure on the quality of content. I have no problem with subscriptions,&quot; the speaker said, adding: &quot;There is no reason why it should be free.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Digital advertising faces some serious challenges if it is to keep the web free - one of which is concerns over the ethics of tracking people's online behaviour without their consent. The success of online ad campaigns is determined by the data that brands can access about internet users. How old are they? What are their interests? Are they male or female, single or with children? Much of this data will be collected from cookies downloaded on to users' computers. Cookie data allows web publishers to track users' online journeys and observe the actions they take on different websites. They can then use this data to helps them target campaigns to different groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   The impact of data protection regulation                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the forthcoming European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), to be implemented in 2018, will tighten up data privacy - and this, some speakers felt, could undermine the ad-funded model of the internet. The stringent new rules, which force companies to get &quot;unambiguous consent&quot; from online users to make use of their data, are expected to be adopted in the UK regardless of Brexit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some participants worried that the Directive's clampdown on using data could make it difficult for certain companies to operate on the internet or to run advertising campaigns. &quot;Some businesses may not survive,&quot; warned one speaker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The participants also discussed whether website owners relying mainly on cookie data are at a disadvantage to websites and social networks where users log in and give their personal details. Facebook, for instance, has in-depth login information about users - their locations, names, likes, activities and friendship networks. The social network offers this data to brands, facilitating highly targeted advertising campaigns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One participant spoke of an ad campaign for the launch of a new product where a strong creative film was shown on Facebook. Depending on how users reacted to the film - whether they watched it the whole way through, or just with the sound off - more messages were served to them and these were refined in stages according to each user's reaction. The speaker said this was highly effective, as it allowed the campaign to filter out those who were not interested and to deliver relevant messages to potential customers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another speaker said Facebook allows brands to constantly change their online advertising as they receive new data about people's likes and dislikes: &quot;I really feel it is only since Facebook has come along that we have had this opportunity to assess data very quickly and then tweak that data.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But another pointed to a recent statement from household products manufacturer Procter &amp; Gamble (P&amp;G), the world's largest advertiser, that it had decided to stop using Facebook's targeting tools.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They had assumed it would be efficient to target (air freshener) Febreze to families with kids and dog owners, but it proved more efficient to go broad in the targeting.&quot; P&amp;G said it was better to promote some products to everybody rather than paying for targeted audiences, as everyone uses laundry detergents or washing-up liquid. Tightly targeted campaigns are more suitable for very specific, niche products.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the speakers were concerned that online advertising places too much emphasis on data and not enough on creativity and persuasion. The use of data was criticised as &quot;the tail wagging the dog&quot; and there was a recognition that some advertising creatives believe data gets in the way of making good campaigns. &quot;They feel the use of data depersonalises,&quot; said one speaker, who added the caveat that attitudes are changing. &quot;I think people have got used to the fact it is not a case of either having data or creative - it is about using both together.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was a consensus that cookie and login data works best for hard-sell campaigns, encouraging people to buy now, rather than for softer-focus, persuasive brand advertising.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   Retargeting - a waste?                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And speakers accepted that &quot;retargeting&quot; campaigns - whereby a user who has visited a website, perhaps to look at some shoes, then has ads for that website follow them around the internet for days, weeks or even months after - are unpopular with users. &quot;It is so frustrating as an advertiser that I am spending on retargeting,&quot; said one speaker. &quot;I am very well aware that those advertising platforms aren't good enough and that we are overly retargeting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problem of retargeting was seen as a failing of automated advertising - called &quot;programmatic advertising&quot; - where software dictates what ads people see based on the data. But some thought that as programmatic technology evolves to become more sophisticated, it will overcome these drawbacks and will deliver a better experience for users and brands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One problem with automated online advertising is that the ads may appear on any website and next to inappropriate content, for instance an ad for an airline could be placed next to an article about an air crash. But one speaker predicted that automated &quot;programmatic&quot; advertising will be able to answer this problem and help brands sift through data to find the most receptive audiences for their messages and identify the most appropriate places to run the ads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Programmatic is very helpful for understanding who those people could be, what their behaviour looks like and how you could go about finding them.&quot; Another compared the situation of programmatic advertising to email. &quot;Email is one of the best-performing channels. But it was tainted for a time because it was abused.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The discussion turned to the use of machine learning, where software analyses data to make judgements about what products, ads and content people should be offered. One speaker said machine learning and robotics would revolutionise marketing. &quot;What we've seen in programmatic advertising is one of the earliest areas where it has made inroads, but I think it will be right across the shop.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But another warned that widespread use of robotics and technology would lead to a depersonalised world: &quot;People are just turning into a kind of jelly between lots of robots.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The discussion returned to the question of whether advertising will continue as the main source of funding for the web. One speaker thought younger users would be reluctant to ever pay for online content. But another disagreed: &quot;We cannot assume that people between the ages of 12 and 21 are going to behave and operate like that for the rest of their lives. We all go through generational change.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Remarkably, there is one thing that is most likely to remain (pun intended) unaffected by the majority decision of the country's voters to leave the European Union, and that is the way the UK does data protection.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The forthcoming EU upgrade to its own data protection legislation, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), is now on the table in finished form and will need to be fully implemented by all member states by mid-2018. This will happen irrespective of any moves by the UK government to leave the EU. The anticipated date for Brexit is also roughly 2018.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2015, 44% of UK export trade was with the EU, and unless that changes dramatically, the UK will continue to rely on the EU for a significant portion of its income. That being the case, we'll be obliged to comply with the GDPR when working with our European partners. As we've all been preparing for the GDPR for some time now (you have, haven't you?), that will need to continue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But what about the rest of our business with the rest of the world?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For that, we currently rely on the Data Protection Act, but, despite holding up well after 18 years of service, it's in need of an upgrade too. New UK legislation will take time to plan and enact, and with other things on the government's collective mind, it makes sense to focus firmly on the GDPR as a predictable and desirable end point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government is most likely to aim to produce a new British version of the Data Protection Act, either agreeing regulations on a country-by-country basis, one for each new trade agreement, or it could enact a single overarching one-size-fits-all law that will apply to all our new trade deals, across the board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The former would be a needless burden on business and quite at odds with the usual stance on 'red tape'. The latter approach could lead to the creation of a weakened set of regulations or guidelines, designed to promote new business by minimising legal encumbrances. However, weak regulation would mean that businesses in the UK would then still have two sets of data protection regulations to apply, possibly poles apart in quality. To avoid confusion, the legislation for the rest of the world cannot be weak - in other words, it will need to look reasonably similar to the GDPR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, we come to the inevitable conclusion that to retain a significant portion of our trade with Europe, smooth the path of new business in this post-Brexit era, and keep the burden of red tape to a minimum, there is one thing that a post-Brexit UK certainly cannot do without. That is, somewhat ironically, the EU GDPR.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UK education is undergoing a period of significant change. The fallout of the recent EU referendum remains to be seen; universities and colleges are now within the remit of the Department for Education, and the intentions of new Education Secretary, Justine Greening, are unknown at this early stage in her tenure. But for all of the challenges this time of uncertainty represents, it's critical for institutions to remember the driving principle behind their success: offering the best student experience possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But what actually contributes to the 'student experience'? Academic factors, such as course offering and teaching quality, understandably spring to mind first and, indeed, these are the areas in which universities and colleges invest most of their resources.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, WPM recently collaborated with YouGov on a research project which revealed students and their parents consider a much larger number of factors to be valuable to the overall student experience. The main takeaway from the research was that, while academic standards remain a priority, communication, convenience, and security are increasingly important.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Read more</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why there's more to student satisfaction than teaching quality</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These factors are often overlooked - albeit unintentionally - but, as we have seen, they are just as crucial to the quality of our education system. Data security is, perhaps, the prime example: our research revealed 91 per cent of those surveyed believe compliance with data protection regulations is either &quot;important&quot; or &quot;very important.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is entirely understandable. When you're attending a university or college, it's fair to expect your private information will remain private, and that everyday processes, such as making payments, are as convenient and secure as possible. From an institutional perspective, a strong data security policy not only enhances student satisfaction, it also saves money and preserves reputations by mitigating the risk of costly data breaches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The challenge of compliance</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, universities and colleges can only assure students and parents their data is in safe hands if they can demonstrate compliance with the major data security standards. The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) will be coming into force in May 2018, but, post-referendum, we don't yet know what this will mean for colleges and universities. For the moment, there are two main security benchmarks to consider: the Data Protection Act 1998 (DPA), and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The former is a legislative measure which requires any organisation handling the information of identifiable living people to maintain certain standards of privacy and discretion. The latter is a set of criteria designed to safeguard networks, access control, and information security within the payments industry. While it has no formal status in UK law, PCI DSS noncompliance carries fines of up to &pound;500,000 from the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In light of this, colleges and universities should be providing regular data security training in accordance with the roles and responsibilities of their staff members. We often assign blame for data breaches to outside, malign influences, but human error still causes more of them than anything else: in 2015, half of the worst incidents were caused by staff making inadvertent mistakes with the system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the spirit of staying current, it's also essential institutional practices don't become stale or outmoded. There will always be room for improvement; data security is a moving target, and goals for success should move with it. By scheduling regular reviews of systems and processes, it's easier to understand how performance relates to key organisational drivers - and where the institution can do better.</SPAN></P>

Complying with data security standards costs money in the short-term, but it can save tens of thousands in fines, and make a college or university a more attractive study destination. When students and parents are satisfied their data is safe and that processes, like making payments are secure, efficient, and convenient, they become less likely to disparage the institution and more likely to promote and recommend it. According to our research, 71 per cent of students and parents would be less likely to recommend the institution to others if they had experienced an unsatisfactory payments experience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Investing in the security of processes like payments will affect your budget, but the enhancement to student experience and institutional reputation will be worth it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stepping towards security</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That last point will no doubt be the most contentious. Educational budgets have been slashed in recent years, and the full consequences of the dissolution of the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills are yet to play out. In times like these, it's understandable to double down on teaching quality and academic standards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it's an impulse that ought to be resisted. Data security isn't flashy, it isn't particularly visible, and any impact it has on an institution's place in the league tables will be negligible at best. Nevertheless, it remains one of the many different factors students are taking into account when judging the quality of their colleges and universities. Education is about more than just courses and lecturers: it's about the entire student experience - and safety and security are absolute prerequisites of a good student experience.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amid the confusion of last Friday there was a corner of corporate Britain that may have breathed a sigh of relief: the cybersecurity departments at the UK's biggest companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, most technology workers vocally opposed an exit. The uncertainty around immigration policy (many of the engineers at British start-ups are EU nationals) will now become a major concern, as will access to European customers - important considering that Silicon Valley enjoys an addressable market of the US economy's stature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Brexit raises another issue for techies - the future of how our data is governed.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In less than two years a massive new piece of EU privacy law, known as the General Data Protection Regulation, will come into force. The law, designed to replace the disparate collection of national data regimes, will enforce strict new rules and give new powers to data regulators. Businesses will have to obtain clear consent before processing citizens' information, disclose when data breaches occur, and could be fined up to 5pc of their global revenues for abuse of the regime. In other words, it is a big stick with which to beat the companies that fail to protect our information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The law had been criticised for being too strict, but was set to be adopted wholeheartedly, and compliance would require a substantial investment at a time when budgets are squeezed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Brexit has thrown a spanner in the works, and the future of privacy law in Britain is more uncertain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many companies that do business in the EU will have to abide by the new legislation, at least when dealing with European consumers, but for others, the future is less clear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even though delays over activating Article 50 mean Britain may not divorce until the regulations come into force in May 2018, cash-strapped technology departments could well be hoping that Brexit will give them a stay of execution, meaning they have to spend less on IT, and fewer restrictions on protecting their customers' personal information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One cybersecurity consultant says that companies were expecting to spend between five and 10 times what it cost to patch the Y2K bug - which cost hundreds of billions worldwide - to comply with the new laws, several had put spending decisions on hold until after last Thursday's vote, and now may not spend it at all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This may all be an irrelevance. Any deal that involves the UK remaining in the single market is likely to require us to adopt the same privacy rules as the EU. Our regulator, the Information Commissioner's Office, might also introduce equivalent regulations. Last week the ICO said that the GDPR, or something very similar to it, will have to be applied &quot;if the UK wants to trade with the single market on equal terms&quot;, suggesting it will push the Government to stick close to Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But if not, a chasm could open up between Britain and the EU on data. European officials - suspicious of the American internet giants and their relationship with the US government - have pushed for strong laws and fines on data protection and cybersecurity. A laissez-faire Britain could well take another, more business friendly path with less oversight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This could have its upsides, within reason. Liberal laws on data protection could encourage investment in areas such as artificial intelligence, an area that has a tricky relationship with privacy at the best of times and in which Britain excels, as shown by the many acquisitions of home-grown AI businesses by the likes of Google.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And, as the Culture, Media and Sport committee proposed last week, we could introduce our own system of pay curbs for executives at companies that fail to protect their customers' data - potentially a more effective incentive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But splitting with Europe on data protection is more likely to be an own goal. While technology has no borders, as one investor said last week, European law does have strict laws on transferring citizens' information outside of the bloc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Countries that want data to freely flow across borders without complicated arrangements must show the EU that its privacy laws are up to scratch. Winning this approval is not easy, as the case of America's battle with the Austrian law student Max Schrems shows. Schrems successfully convinced the European Court of Justice last year to throw out Safe Harbour - a data treaty between the EU and US - leaving out thousands of businesses that transfer data across the Atlantic. A successor treaty has been months in the making, and could well be challenged again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An independent Britain, beginning to figure out its own data regulations, and in the middle of implementing Theresa May's controversial surveillance laws, could find it even more difficult to agree a data pact with a wounded Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Any failure would be a headache for any British company doing business on the continent, especially for those employing people www.abroad.UK investment in areas such as data centres, as announced by Microsoft and Amazon, could be affected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With cyber attacks on the rise, corporate IT defences creaking and the growing importance of technology to the economy, it is an unfortunate time to be questioning the future of our data laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whatever our politicians negotiate and decide on freedom of movement and trade, they should act to ensure that information transferred across the Channel is not interrupted, sooner rather than later.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week I visited an island and stood among a crowd of puffins. If I turned my head I could see the lighthouse. If I looked up, the arctic terns were above my head. Yet I never left a gallery in Gateshead. How come? I was wearing a virtual-reality mask.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have tried this &quot;Oculus&quot; technology once before, when visiting Facebook in California (which owns Oculus) and it is truly extraordinary to have an all-round, up-and-down view of the world depending on how you turn your head. All it involves is a special (Samsung) smartphone jammed into a pair of goggles.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is it the next wave of tech? I have no idea. Apart from games, virtual visits to inaccessible nature reserves and maybe estate agents, it may not have many practical applications. But I may be wrong. Does the next wave lie in big data? Or robotics? Or the internet of things? Or something else entirely? Nobody knows. When silicon chips came along, few foresaw personal computers; when the internet arrived, few predicted the central role of search engines or one-click shopping; when mobile phones took us by surprise, few imagined texts, let alone social media, sat-nav, phone cameras or the sharing economy. The one thing that the history of technology shows above all else is our complete inability to see what comes next.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet something will come next, of that we can be confident. By 2025 there will be a vast new firm, valued at an astronomical sum and run by people who look like teenagers from a futuristic building in ... well, where will it be? Can you imagine it being in Europe? Me neither.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite having money, skills, markets, research funding and infrastructure galore, Europe has consistently failed to create the sort of digital giants that a couple of salty inlets on the west coast of America spawn like fish fry. We fell behind in minicomputers, fell further behind in personal computers, caught up briefly in mobile phones (remember Nokia?) then watched Google and Apple, Facebook and Amazon, Wikipedia and Twitter dominate the digital world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The total value of &quot;unicorns&quot; (billion-dollar tech start-ups) created in Europe is about half of Facebook's valuation alone. (Britain has the most of those European unicorns.) Spotify, the music-streaming firm based in Stockholm, is the nearest Europe has to a digital giant - and it is now threatening to leave Sweden for America. Carl Bildt, former prime minister of Sweden, and chairman of the Global Commission on Internet Governance, recently made a speech in which he said that &quot;Europe is lagging behind and the gap with the US is widening&quot;. In 2001, he said, Europe was investing 80 per cent as much in digital as the US. Today that proportion is just 60 per cent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fortunately, our masters in Brussels have a plan. Unlike us, you see, they do know what is coming next in tech, being altogether wiser folk. The European Commission, as part of its &quot;digital agenda&quot;, has unveiled a (EURO)5 billion action plan to &quot;unify and galvanise&quot; Europe's progress towards the &quot;fourth industrial revolution&quot;. According to the EurActiv website it wants to &quot;put in place all the necessary building blocks for the next industrial phase so that European firms remain [sic] in the driving seat&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fine words. Yet to achieve this, what's needed is not the picking of winners, or even the setting of standards, indeed nothing top-down at all. What's needed is the general encouragement of the conditions under which bright people set up businesses and engage in massive amounts of trial and error to discover unpredictable opportunities. That means generous tax breaks for entrepreneurs, light-touch regulation, access to global talent and tolerance of failure. Then stand back and let a thousand flowers bloom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet there is no sign of such policies being discussed in Brussels. The measures the commission is currently proposing are making it harder to do digital business. Prominent among them is the general data protection regulation (GDPR), agreed in April with very little fanfare and coming into force by 2018. It's a &quot;regulation&quot; not a directive, which is the commission's preferred new way of doing things these days - that way it does not even have to waft through parliament, but just lands in our law unscrutinised by any national democracy. A harbinger of how the EU will be run from the centre if we vote to remain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GDPR punishes any company that mishandles data with a fine of up to 4 per cent of turnover - which could wipe out all profits in a lowmargin sector - or (EURO)20 million, whichever is the larger. Instead of leaving it up to national information commissioners to set standards for data protection and limiting the risk to any one state, it makes the concept transnational. So the whole company will be vulnerable to a data-handling mistake in the weakest subsidiary or partner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You can see where this came from: European politicians suspicious at what the likes of Google do with &quot;our&quot; data. But it will have a deterrent effect on home-grown digital companies trying to &quot;enrich European citizens' lives by discovering solutions to challenges in health care, education, or the environment&quot; as Robert Atkinson, president of the think tank the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, puts it. One entrepreneur tells me: &quot;If there is a more potent impediment to free trade over national borders between companies that will have to rely upon their partners' resilient and robust compliance procedures, I should be very surprised.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tech entrepreneurs say that the additional cost to companies (and perhaps public-sector bodies) of trying to protect themselves in the light of the GDPR is likely to be prohibitive. Handling data about people is what digital companies do, and while it is right to insist they do not mess up, it is wrong to extend the concept of private property too literally into cyberspace. We do not punish people for discussing other people in pubs, after all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Europe's biggest problem is its inability to achieve significant economic growth, unlike all the other continents. Ordinary macroeconomic management just won't do: we need to rediscover the passion for innovation that was the continent's hallmark for centuries. Yet when faced with a whole new digital world, the best the European Commission can think of doing is putting obstacles in the way of entrepreneurs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By 2025 there will be a vast new firm - but it won't be in Europe</SPAN></P>

When I clicked it open somewhat suspiciously, this line jumped out at me.&nbsp; &quot;We've recently noticed a potential risk to your LinkedIn account coming from outside LinkedIn. Just to be safe, you'll need to reset your password the next time you log in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'd known that a list of 117m LinkedIn usernames and passwords had turned up for sale on the dark web, but to me it was an abstraction.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I've written about cybersecurity hacks  and the implications of data leaks, but the consequences only hit home when this happens to you. And it's very likely to happen (or already have happened) to each of you sooner or later.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a whole, we are failing miserably at even basic security measures: everyone from large corporations to well-informed individuals fall prey to novice password errors .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We should be using password manager apps that randomly generate passwords stored in an encrypted file, but that's not how most of us manage our online lives. Instead we resort to memorable&nbsp;keys, which are rendered inherently useless because they can be easily guessed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Increasingly, it seems that passwords are going to be replaced by...you. Your face, your fingerprints, your iris, even your heartbeat will authenticate your entry into the digital world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the Biometric Research Group, 650m people used biometrics to operate their mobile phones at the end of 2015. By 2020, the number of biometric smartphone users will be at 2bn and growing. In fact, Europe's new data protection regulation for businesses, the GDPR, includes clauses relating to how genetic and biometric data must be treated, foreshadowing their widespread use.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We can't stop the sweeping changes, but we'd better watch out: relying fully on biometrics is a bad idea. Not only is it inconvenient - people tend to share accounts and devices with others, making unique biometrics a hindrance - but it could also be genuinely dangerous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, most of us are still struggling with a copious number of passwords. So we use memorable phrases, words and numbers . For instance the LinkedIn data showed that &quot;123456&quot; was the most popular password, apparently used by 1.1m users, while &quot;linkedin,&quot;came in second with 172,523 instances of use.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Evidence of this ridiculous habit is bolstered by a separate study from January which found that &quot;123456&quot;, &quot;qwerty&quot; and even &quot;password&quot; were among the most commonly used passwords on the internet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another way we cope is by reusing the same (perhaps highly secure) password for multiple accounts. I myself had to backtrack and change the locks on several digital doors after the LinkedIn warning because of my rash password reuse. Research has found that hackers have successfully accessed victims' other online accounts by reusing passwords.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's no big surprise to say that the password system is broken. Enforcing long, complex passwords that must be periodically changed does very little to protect you. It actually make them easier to crack, because of how predictable we humans become when forced to conform to rigid rules.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In February this year, HSBC and First Direct rolled out fingerprint and voice recognition systems to authenticate almost 15m online accounts. MasterCard will use selfies instead of pin numbers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Edging into the scifi future, look at devices like the Microsoft Lumia 950 smartphone that scans your iris to give you access.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Selfies to kill off passwords 'within five years', says MastercardPlay!00:47</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But here's why I think replacing passwords with biometrics could be a dangerous move: once stolen, you've lost it forever and you can never replace your face or your heartbeat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Worse, your biometrics uniquely identify you, meaning you can be easily traced by criminals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">British cybersecurity company Darktrace, which counts federal governments and major corporations including Drax Power Station, BT, and National Rail among its customers, says it has already seen this affect its clients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Darktrace's hacking diagnostic tool was installed in a large Asian manufacturing business which used a fingerprint system to control access to sensitive areas of its campus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The system had been successfully attacked, resulting in the loss of the entire database of all employee fingerprints. The attacker had even gained the ability to add new fingerprints to the system, admitting him or her to any part of the business. In this case, the biometric data gave the hacker even more access than employee passwords might have done.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Can you trust fingerprint scanners?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year, it was reported that DNA database companies like Ancestry.com and 23andMe had been asked to turn over genetic data of their users to law enforcement. It's not hard to imagine scenarios where crimes are pinned on the wrong person, or conversely criminals planting evidence linking you irrefutably with dodgy activities.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm not suggesting we do away with biometrics altogether: it is the most secure alternative to our current options and as connected devices explode onto the internet, we will need to find a failsafe way to secure the tsunami of data we generate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But don't be fooled into thinking they're a silver bullet. We need to build an ironclad layer of protection for our biometric data, with the same urgency with which we are embracing the death of passwords.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week I opened up my inbox to find a new email from LinkedIn Security. &quot;Reset your LinkedIn password&quot; read the subject line. When I clicked it open somewhat suspiciously, this line jumped out at me.&nbsp; &quot;We've recently noticed a potential risk to your LinkedIn account coming from outside LinkedIn. Just to be safe, you'll need to reset your password the next time you log in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'd known that a list of 117m LinkedIn usernames and passwords had turned up for sale on the dark web, but to me it was an abstraction.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I've written about cybersecurity hacks  and the implications of data leaks, but the consequences only hit home when this happens to you. And it's very likely to happen (or already have happened) to each of you sooner or later.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a whole, we are failing miserably at even basic security measures: everyone from large corporations to well-informed individuals fall prey to novice password errors .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We should be using password manager apps that randomly generate passwords stored in an encrypted file, but that's not how most of us manage our online lives. Instead we resort to easily remembered keys, which are rendered inherently useless because they can be easily guessed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">                   How to pick a password                   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Increasingly, it seems that passwords are going to be replaced by...you. Your face, your fingerprints, your iris, even your heartbeat will authenticate your entry into the digital world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the Biometric Research Group, 650m people used biometrics to operate their mobile phones at the end of 2015. By 2020, the number of biometric smartphone users will be at 2bn and growing. In fact, Europe's new data protection regulation for businesses, the GDPR, includes clauses relating to how genetic and biometric data must be treated, foreshadowing their widespread use.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We can't stop the sweeping changes, but we'd better watch out: relying fully on biometrics is a bad idea. Not only is it inconvenient - people tend to share accounts and devices with others, making unique biometrics a hindrance - but it could also be genuinely dangerous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, most of us are still struggling with a copious number of passwords. So we use memorable phrases, words and numbers . For instance the LinkedIn data showed that &quot;123456&quot; was the most popular password, apparently used by 1.1m users, while &quot;linkedin,&quot;came in second with 172,523 instances of use.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Evidence of this ridiculous habit is bolstered by a separate study from January which found that &quot;123456&quot;, &quot;qwerty&quot; and even &quot;password&quot; were among the most commonly used passwords on the internet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another way we cope is by reusing the same (perhaps highly secure) password for multiple accounts. I myself had to backtrack and change the locks on several digital doors after the LinkedIn warning because of my rash password reuse. Research has found that hackers have successfully accessed victims' other online accounts by reusing passwords.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's no big surprise to say that the password system is broken. Enforcing long, complex passwords that must be periodically changed does very little to protect you. It actually make them easier to crack, because of how predictable we humans become when forced to conform to rigid rules.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So what's the alternative? It began with Touch ID on our iPhones but since then biometrics have expanded all around us: Google announced it would replace passwords on Android apps with a &quot;Trust Score&quot; calculated from behavioural patterns like typing habits. Banks are already testing this out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In February this year, HSBC and First Direct rolled out fingerprint and voice recognition systems to authenticate almost 15m online accounts. MasterCard will use selfies instead of pin numbers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Edging into the scifi future, look at devices like the Microsoft Lumia 950 smartphone that scans your iris to give you access. The rationale is that it's hard to steal biometric data: to replicate your fingerprint is difficult (although not impossible) and heart rate and genetics data is irreproducible. It's the most unique password you could ever have, and you don't have to memorise it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Selfies to kill off passwords 'within five years', says MastercardPlay!00:47</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But here's why I think replacing passwords with biometrics could be a dangerous move: once stolen, you've lost it forever and you can never replace your face or your heartbeat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Worse, your biometrics uniquely identify you, meaning you can be easily traced by criminals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">British cybersecurity company Darktrace, which counts federal governments and major corporations including Drax Power Station, BT, and National Rail among its customers, says it has already seen this affect its clients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Darktrace's hacking diagnostic tool was installed in a large Asian manufacturing business which used a fingerprint system to control access to sensitive areas of its campus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The system had been successfully attacked, resulting in the loss of the entire database of all employee fingerprints. The attacker had even gained the ability to add new fingerprints to the system, admitting him or her to any part of the business. In this case, the biometric data gave the hacker even more access than employee passwords might have done.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Can you trust fingerprint scanners?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year, it was reported that DNA database companies like Ancestry.com and 23andMe had been asked to turn over genetic data of their users to law enforcement. It's not hard to imagine scenarios where crimes are pinned on the wrong person, or conversely criminals planting evidence linking you irrefutably with dodgy activities.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm not suggesting we do away with biometrics altogether: it is the most secure alternative to our current options and as connected devices explode onto the internet, we will need to find a failsafe way to secure the tsunami of data we generate.</SPAN></P>

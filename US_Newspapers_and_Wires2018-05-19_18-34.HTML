<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON - Banks are grappling with a pair of competing regulatory deadlines that may leave them with intercontinental whiplash over the collection of customers' personal data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time that U.S. regulators are pressing banks to comply with an anti-money-laundering rule requiring them to collect more customer information, any bank with European Union customers has just a week to meet a separate EU deadline to ramp up data protection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is like a regulatory nightmare with everything coming out,&quot; said Jennifer Newton, director of risk advisory services at Kaufman Rossin's Miami office, speaking specifically about the EU mandate. &quot;From a financial perspective, not a lot of them are ready and they either don't understand the implications or what applies to them based on their customers.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since May 11, U.S. banks have already had to comply with pieces of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network's Customer Due Diligence rule. The anti-money-laundering requirement, part of regulators' &quot;know-your-customer&quot; policy, requires banks to obtain customer information to report beneficial owners of business accounts. Banks' difficulty in complying with the rule led Fincen to delay a controversial component until August.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But by May 25, some U.S. banks also must comply with the EU's massive General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, if they have European account holders. That rule requires banks to adopt measures to better safeguard client information and immediately report data breaches, or they could face hefty fines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. financial firms are trying to figure out how to have separate and much more stringent data protection standards for their European customers under the GDPR, compared with U.S. standards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, firms must report a data breach within 72 hours of becoming aware of it under the GDPR, but the U.S. currently imposes no similar federal timeline for reporting a breach. However, some states have separate requirements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Typically, a bank would just implement the most stringent standard across the board to be safe, Newton said. But with GDPR, the timeline for reporting a breach is much shorter than what many U.S. banks have built into their systems. And they will first need to figure out how much of their customer base would fall under the EU requirements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Compliance with GDPR is made doubly challenging while banks are separately building a system to report the personal information of any beneficial owner with at least a 25% stake in a company opening an account, as required under Fincen's CDD rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Observers said the Fincen rule could potentially trigger requirements under the GDPR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If one of those beneficial owners is a &quot;European national whose data is subject to GDPR, the fact that the bank is collecting that additional data because of CDD may . . . trigger foreign protection requirements that may not otherwise apply to a data file,&quot; said Oliver Ireland, senior counsel at Morrison &amp; Foerster. &quot;In practice, I don't know how big that burden is going to be.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Uncertainty among banks over how to implement the competing rules was the driving force in Fincen's decision to release a &quot;frequently asked questions&quot; document in April to clear up some of the confusion. Then, on Wednesday, less than a week after the rule took effect, Fincen said it was delaying a portion of the rule - requiring banks to report the beneficial owners of accounts that renew or roll over, like CDs - to Aug. 9.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During this time, Fincen will determine whether and to what extent additional exceptive relief may be appropriate for such financial products and services that were established before May 11, 2018, but are expected to rollover or renew after such date,&quot; Fincen said in its ruling issued Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fincen has been working on this rule for six years but the additional extension speaks to just how complicated implementing data-related regulations has become despite a universal goal to protect the financial system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Although we agree on the importance of this information, there are legitimate concerns about the application of this new rule and the impact it will have on financial institutions,&quot; Rep. Steve Pearce, R.-N.M., chairman of the Terrorism and Illicit Finance subcommittee, said during a hearing on the CDD rule Wednesday. &quot;Adding additional requirements will likely increase this occurrence and cut business off from the financial system.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Testifying at the hearing, Fincen Director Kenneth A. Blanco argued that the rule would instead amplify a safe financial system rather than causing more de-risking at banks. But he said the agency will monitor the rule's implementation to watch for such issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What we're talking about is a financial system that is safe and secure that everybody can benefit from, including the banks .</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For many companies, GDPR has become a four-letter acronym.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The European Union's new General Data Protection Rule - which applies to virtually any kind of data that can be used to identify a person - goes into effect May 25. And companies around the world are rushing to make sure they're in compliance, or at least can demonstrate that they're hard at work trying to meet the EU demands.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[ Further reading: Will blockchain run afoul of GDPR? (Yes and no) ]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GDPR is designed to protect personal privacy, (hopefully) make companies more secure from data breaches and force them to get their collective hands around all the data they collect, use and distribute.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As CSO's Michael Nadeau notes, that's no small task. He and CSO senior reporter Steve Ragan joined Mark Lewis, IDG Communications vice president of audience developement, and Computerworld Executive Editor Ken Mingis to discuss the ramifications of the new law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Lewis pointed out, even though the regulation comes from the EU, it affects U.S.-based companies, too - including IDG Communications. That's why the company, which has a global footprint, has been working for the better part of year to line up its data ducks in time for the new rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many other firms, said Ragan, are only now beginning to realize how far behind they are in that process. His prediction: most companies won't be fully ready, and some could be in serious trouble in the event of a breach. (Fines for non-compliance in the wake of a data breach could be as high as 4% of a company's revenues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For companies still trying to figure out how to proceed, he and Lewis explained the kinds of questions that have to be asked (and answered). Even then, Nadeau said, the May 25 deadline is really just the beginning of a never-ending task for companies. Because even if they lock down everything now, changing technology will mean an ever-evolving privacy landscape that requires constant vigilance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vol. 1</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">No. 1</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">776  words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taking control of enterprise information through a data remediation program can dramatically reduce enterprise risk and costs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Building a business case, ensuring executive buy-in, training staff and executing a program to address today's and tomorrow's challenges are not always easy, but important roadblocks that legal and information governance teams must overcome. When corporations are able to successfully execute a remediation program, they achieve much better footing to handle future challenges as data volumes and formats continue to expand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier this year, the Advice from Counsel study, which examined data privacy and security concerns and best practices among counsel at large U.S. corporations, reported that more than half of respondents have successfully conducted data remediation projects. They reported benefits including better protection of private and sensitive information and lowered storage costs. Interviews conducted for the study also revealed the strategies successful teams had utilized.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following are the top 10 tips offered for getting a project done.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Figure out what exists. It is impossible to conduct thorough and accurate record destruction without knowing the full scope of what exists in the first place. Conducting a data mapping exercise is often the first step in identifying redundant, old or trivial data that is ready for remediation. We find these data maps can serve many other purposes and stakeholders, such as GDPR, e-discovery and records management to name a few.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Minimize business disruption. When it comes to internal data remediation, a project has a greater chance of success if it can be customized to how employees work, and disruption can be minimized. End users would rather be touched once with a single process or tool than 12 times with multiple processes or tools. The decision-making process should also be as easy as possible for employees. People who are not in IT don't want to be responsible for activities they think IT or information governance should do, so remediation teams should make every effort to work behind the scenes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Future-proof the program. It is important to ensure that fewer data pools are created in the future. IG teams should build controls into any new initiative before it is launched, so the disposition plan and requirements are already in place. It is very hard to do this retroactively after volumes of data have amassed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Look beyond email. In IG, there is a tendency to focus just on electronic data, but information in paper documents and unstructured databases must also be addressed. Recognize there is legacy information (such as old payroll records or W2s) that must also be remediated and/or protected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Aim for quick wins. For some, starting a small project can help the team learn about what works and build momentum. Start small and work with a dedicated team or business unit with which the legal team has a strong relationship and use it as a pilot partner. Once successful, that project can be the jumping off point for executing on a broader scale. Many times, companies already have technology options in-house so the startup expense can be minimal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Make the most of bad events. When a company or even its competitor faces a significant event, such as a data breach, it should be a catalyst to advocate for change. According to one assistant general counsel interviewed in the study, &quot;Your business case has to come after an adverse event. When the company hasn't implemented a program and hasn't had the e-discovery issues that other companies have had, I think you need an event to motivate change.\xE2 </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Target PST Files. PST files are low-hanging fruit when it comes to data remediation, and efforts here can have a big impact. A PST is usually a huge file with each employee having many of them. PST files allow an employee to save individual messages to their hard drive or copy all of their personal folders to a PST, circumventing archiving efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Training is critical. Train staff on the company's retention policy. People should be more trained and aware of the need for document retention due to the significant risk and potential penalties in certain jurisdictions for improper data management. It should be approached with the same rigor as any part of the compliance program.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Consider Automation. Developing a policy is one thing, but executing it can be a challenge. Respondents reported success in using a wide variety of software tools to set a data remediation schedule and actually implement it. One said, &quot;Automated systems are increasingly used and serve as the only way to get people to pay attention.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">       One week after the full implementation of the EU data protection regulation, most European and US companies are not yet ready for the new rules, a Capgemini study released today reveals. Brits are the best prepared.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a race against time. That is how the overwhelming majority of companies in Europe and the United States are, concludes a study by the consultancy firm Capgemini that on 25 May 85% admit that they can not be ready in time for the new rules. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The study, conducted by Capgemini's Digital Transformation Institute and entitled &quot;Seizing the GDPR Advantage: From mandate to high-value opportunity&quot;, involved questionnaires for 1,000 managers and 6,000 consumers in eight markets - the United States, the United Kingdom, Spain, the Netherlands , Germany, Italy, France and Sweden. The objective was to understand the measures being taken by companies, how prepared they are to respond to and meet the requirements and what business opportunities the RGDP generated. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the moment, British companies are the most advanced, although only 55% respond that on May 25 will already be largely or totally compliant with the new requirements. This is followed by Spain (54%), Germany (51%) and the Netherlands (51%). Sweden is the country that still has more to do: only 33% of Swedish companies will be largely or completely compliant with the RGDP rules on time. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Capgemini points out that this can be a &quot;missed opportunity to increase business volume,&quot; as the study also concludes that &quot;39% of consumers who are convinced that a particular company protects their personal data naturally increase the volume of shopping with this organization. &quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to Capgemini's accounts, &quot;consumers even spend 24% more than usual&quot; on compliant companies. And in addition, &quot;40% reported having carried out more frequent transactions with this company (s), whether it was on an ad hoc or regular basis&quot;. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the other hand, across Europe, 57% of individuals said they will take action against companies that do not properly protect their personal data. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DUBLIN -- If Mark Zuckerberg doesn't know who Helen Dixon is, he will soon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From an unassuming townhouse in the Irish capital, Ms. Dixon, the country's data protection commissioner, leads an agency that was once a bureaucratic backwater. Employees share offices and have few of the perks available in Facebook's building nearby: The main free amenities here are water, coffee and tea. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Yet Ms. Dixon will soon gain vast new authority to investigate and fine Facebook, as well as an array of other technology giants with regional headquarters in Ireland. Amid increased concerns over online privacy, a sweeping new European privacy law could make her one of the world's most consequential regulators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  She is eager to test her newfound power. But the question remains whether her tiny agency is able -- or willing -- to stand up to tech behemoths of Silicon Valley.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''There's a wave coming toward us that we need to push back against,'' Ms. Dixon, who spent the first 10 years of her career working for tech companies, said in an interview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Europe's new General Data Protection Regulation is seen by experts as the world's most aggressive set of internet privacy rules. It is expected to come into force on May 25, and it will give more than 500 million people living in the European Union the right to keep companies from collecting personal data, or to have it deleted. Regulators like Ms. Dixon will be able to fine companies up to 4 percent of global revenue -- equivalent to about $1.6 billion for Facebook.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  [Read more about what the new European privacy rules mean for you.]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The privacy law highlights broader skepticism of Silicon Valley in Europe, where regulators have punished companies for violating tax and antitrust laws, not doing enough to stop the spread of hate speech and misinformation online, and intrusively gobbling up data on consumers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ireland in particular is taking center stage in the wide-ranging battle. The country is the European headquarters for data-hungry companies including Airbnb, Apple, Facebook, Google, Twitter and Microsoft, which owns LinkedIn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If companies do not comply with the law, Ms. Dixon said, ''they will suffer consequences.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But for all the tough talk, the reality is that her agency subsists on an annual budget of 7.5 million euros, equivalent to $9 million. That's roughly as much revenue as the companies she oversees generate over all in 10 minutes. Facebook, which also owns WhatsApp and Instagram, has hundreds of people globally working on data protection regulation alone, including lawyers and privacy experts hired in Dublin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The data protection office was once an afterthought. During an effort by the Irish government to move less-critical agencies out of Dublin, it was relocated in 2006 50 miles west to a town called Portarlington, population 8,368. Its power was so limited that it could not publicize investigations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ms. Dixon, whose father was an army officer and mother a schoolteacher, grew up in a small town in central Ireland before moving to Dublin for university. She worked for companies including the business software firm Citrix Systems before moving into government. She later received a postgraduate diploma in computer science.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Fittingly for her current position, Ms. Dixon guards her privacy. She will not share her age, other than saying she is in her ''40s,'' and she has become more careful with data since taking the job. She does not use Facebook or Instagram (though she does have a LinkedIn profile).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Since taking over in 2014, Ms. Dixon has successfully lobbied for more funding and got the headquarters put back in Dublin. A move to a bigger office is in the works. She has hired lawyers, investigators and engineers. The staff will total 140 this year, up from 30 when she joined, with plans to reach 200 in the next few years, if budget increases are approved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But if data privacy is truly a priority globally, Ms. Dixon said, more resources are needed. Her office is actually among the better funded privacy agencies globally, but is still a minnow compared with, say, Ireland's financial services regulator, which has a budget about 40 times greater.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The question for governments is, how much enforcement do we want to do, how seriously do we want to take the risk to our fundamental rights and freedoms in this area?'' said Ms. Dixon, carrying a bound copy of the new law. ''We need the funding and resources commensurate with the level of importance. This office would suggest it should be far more highly resourced.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Budgetary constraints are not new to regulators overseeing powerful industries. But privacy groups worry that without strong oversight, the European rules, years in the making, will do little to crimp the power of Silicon Valley.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There is evidence those concerns are well founded. In a Reuters survey of privacy regulators in 24 European Union countries, 17 said they did not have the needed funding or legal powers to enforce data protection regulation. Ireland did not participate in the survey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ms. Dixon must also contend with skepticism among privacy advocates, stemming largely from Ireland's history of lax oversight of the technology industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Her predecessors are faulted for not taking earlier action against Facebook, even when complaints were filed years ago about data-mining practices similar to those eventually used by the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica. The European Commission in 2016 also ordered Ireland to recoup about $15.6 billion in unpaid taxes from Apple. (The decision is being appealed.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The culture has to be changed,'' said Max Schrems, a Austria-based lawyer and online privacy advocate who filed the earlier complaints against Facebook. ''You can have the best law, but if nobody enforces it, then you're not going to go anywhere.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Advocates of the new law say it is already having a positive impact and that oversight is spread out. A new European Data Protection Board will help coordinate investigations and pool resources across European Union countries, giving regulators outside Ireland the ability to bring action. The data protection regulation also allows private groups to recruit consumers into class-action-style complaints -- not as common in Europe as the United States -- that could result in sizable damages against businesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A looming question, however, is how much people really care. Ms. Dixon cited Facebook's most recent financial report, which showed growing user numbers, revenue and profit, despite the Cambridge Analytica scandal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We should be acting as data protection authorities in the name of data subjects, but you often as a regulator in this space have the feeling that you're not mandated by the general public,'' she said. ''Either they don't care or they actively oppose what we're doing.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Representatives from the technology industry have made regular visits to the converted 18th-century Georgian home used by Ms. Dixon's team. Aware that a public backlash is putting pressure on regulators to rein in Silicon Valley, Facebook and others have been courting Ms. Dixon, putting forward their case that their data protection policies comply with the new European law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We've really leapt into explaining what we've done and the thinking that's gone into that,'' said Stephen Deadman, Facebook's global deputy chief privacy officer. ''I've got faith and confidence that the way Helen Dixon's office will perform its function will be true to the spirit and requirements of G.D.P.R., rather than being blown around by whatever is happening in the media.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Google and Twitter declined to comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Even with limited resources, Ms. Dixon is studying her adversaries. When Mr. Zuckerberg testified before Congress last month, she stayed up late at home despite the time difference to watch as the Facebook chief executive answered questions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Asked if she had a message for him and other tech executives, she said they should expect her to use her new powers ''to the fullest.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Companies that do business with those in the European Union must comply with its General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The law could compel people in other countries to demand such measures, too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: How does the GDPR change data privacy in Europe?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Passed two years ago, the GDPR is poised to reshape how companies, regardless of location, collect personal data for uses that include advertising. Such information includes birth dates, political affiliations, and television viewing habits.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This translates into a few major steps, according to Nick Couldry, a media and communications professor at the London School of Economics and Political Science. First, companies will be required to alert EU users when they are collecting data and the reason for it. &quot;You have to be told why I'm collecting the data, basically what I'm going to do,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GDPR also stipulates that alerts for users must be expressed in ordinary, nontechnical language - not in dense columns of legalese. In addition, EU consumers will have the &quot;right to be forgotten,&quot; which will allow them to have their personal data removed from any company whenever they choose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: How does data policy in the United States compare?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No single US law regulates the use of personal data. Instead, the country relies on a web of state and federal legislation with various focuses. For example, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) lays out rules for how health plans and providers handle information about patients, but the law's protections don't extend beyond health care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The difference between the US and the EU, says Dr. Couldry, is in part about ideology. While in the US data collection is largely considered a natural expression of a free market, legislators in the EU see data privacy as a right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You start from a human rights perspective, that the collection of data by you about me changes the conditions under which I'm living in a fundamental way, as opposed to saying the collection is just a normal part of markets functioning,&quot; Couldry says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That distinction carries weight when it comes to crafting regulations, says Ifeoma Ajunwa, a professor in the Industrial and Labor Relations School at Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the US, privacy is essentially thought of as a property right.... It could be for sale, in that you can trade access to platforms in exchange for some of your private information,&quot; she says. &quot;The difference, of course, is that in the EU, because privacy is not predominantly viewed as a property right but rather as a human right, it merits governmental protection&quot; on a comprehensive basis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: How are companies responding?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the full global effect of the GDPR remains to be seen, major companies around the world have already begun to make changes to abide by the rules.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;From the point of view of corporations ... that operate globally like Facebook, Google, Twitter, and so on, they're all facing the questions of how they adapt to the European legislation,&quot; Couldry says. &quot;It's gradually become clear that it's far more important for them to be able to do business seamlessly in Europe than to take the position of not complying.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GDPR subjects any company, regardless of where it's based, to fines of up to (EURO)20 million (about $24 million) if it is judged to be noncompliant when engaging with EU customers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But being sure of which consumers are located in the EU is complicated, says Bart Lazar, a data privacy lawyer in the Chicago office of Seyfarth Shaw. &quot;Oftentimes we don't know just through social media or any email address where an individual resides or what country they're a citizen of so ... companies are put in sort of a risk quandary,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: Is the EU setting a new global standard?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Europe passed the GDPR, Britain introduced mirror legislation in its Parliament, even though voters in 2016 opted to leave the EU, Couldry notes. It could be an early sign of a social shift set off by the GDPR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The knowledge that corporations must increase their consumer protections in Europe will likely lead many foreign users to demand the same safeguards, observers say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's possible that these companies will have variations [across countries], but then they'll have to deal with something that could be a market disadvantage, when smart citizens spot that they're less protected when they're searching on their phone ... in America than when they're sitting in Europe,&quot; Couldry says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Ajunwa agrees, stating that user expectations will be quick to fall in line with the most comprehensive data protections. &quot;Once organizational behavior changes, then that's going to trickle down to societal impact,&quot; she says.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a growing realization that our data is under attack. From breaches at Equifax to Cambridge Analytica's misuse of the profile information of more than 87 million Facebook users, it seems as if none of our personal data is safe. And more and more about us is being captured, stored and processed by smart devices like thermostats, baby monitors, WiFi-connected streetlights and traffic sensors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the United States, people who are concerned are looking to Europe. They see Europe's ''right to be forgotten,'' by which citizens can force companies to erase some of their personal data, as a step toward regaining ownership of their online selves. And on May 25, the European Union will bring into force the most sweeping regulation ever of what can be done with people's data. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This law, the General Data Protection Regulation, will give citizens greater control over their data while requiring those who process personal data in the European Union or about its citizens to take responsibility for its protection. The G.D.P.R. will give Europeans the right to data portability (allowing people, for example, to take their data from one social network to another) and the right not to be subject to decisions based on automated data processing (prohibiting, for example, the use of an algorithm to reject applicants for jobs or loans). Advocates seem to believe that the new law could replace a corporate-controlled internet with a digital democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There's just one problem: No one understands the G.D.P.R.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The law is staggeringly complex. After three years of intense lobbying and contentious negotiation, the European Parliament published a draft, which then received some 4,000 amendment proposals, a reflection of the divergent interests at stake. Corporations, governments and academic institutions all process personal data, but they use it for different purposes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There's another reason for the regulation's complexity and ambiguity: What are often framed as legal and technical questions are also questions of values. The European Union's 28 member states have different historical experiences and contemporary attitudes about data collection. Germans, recalling the Nazis' deadly efficient use of information, are suspicious of government or corporate collection of personal data; people in Nordic countries, on the other hand, link the collection and organization of data to the functioning of strong social welfare systems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Thus, the regulation is intentionally ambiguous, representing a series of compromises. It promises to ease restrictions on data flows while allowing citizens to control their personal data, and to spur European economic growth while protecting the right to privacy. It skirts over possible differences between current and future technologies by using broad principles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But those broad principles don't always accord with current data practices. The regulation requires those who process personal data to demonstrate accountability in part by limiting data collection and processing to what is necessary for a specific purpose, forbidding other uses. That may sound good, but machine learning, for example -- one of the most active areas of research in artificial intelligence, used for targeted advertising, self-driving cars and more -- uses data to train computer systems to make decisions that cannot be specified in advance, derived from the original data or explained after the fact.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In 2017, the year after the regulation was approved, I interviewed scientists, data managers, legal scholars, lawyers, ethicists and activists in Sweden. I learned that many scientists and data managers who will be subject to the law find it incomprehensible. They doubted that absolute compliance was even possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One expert at Sweden's national bioinformatics platform said: ''We often wonder, like, what does the law say about this? Nobody knows.'' Or as a scientist in charge of computing and storage facilities at a major university put it, the G.D.P.R. says, more or less, ''that adequate safety should be in place, and so on. Right -- what does that mean?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Many of the law's broad principles, though they avoid references to specific technologies, are nevertheless based on already outdated assumptions about technology. ''I think it's very clear that they imagined some company that has your data physically stored somewhere, and you have the right to take it out,'' a law professor told me of the G.D.P.R.'s approach to data portability. But in the era of big data and cloud services, data rarely exists in only one place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  What the regulation really means is likely to be decided in European courts, which is sure to be a drawn-out and confusing process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Still, the G.D.P.R. is not a lost cause. We do need rules about data. But legal frameworks, particularly when they are long, complex and ambiguous, can't be the only or even the primary resource guiding the day-to-day work of data protection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If the ultimate goal is to change what people do with our data, we need more research that looks carefully at how personal data is collected and by whom, and how those people make decisions about data protection. Policymakers should use such studies as a basis for developing empirically grounded, practical rules.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the end, pragmatic guidelines that make sense to people who work with data might do a lot more to protect our personal data than a law that promises to change the internet but can't explain how.</SPAN></P>

The answer becomes trickier for companies that are based strictly in the United States. This is because the language of the GDPR is broad enough to include U.S.-based companies that don't have an office in the EU. The GDPR applies to U.S.-based companies that offer goods and services to customers living in the EU, but it also goes one step further and applies to U.S.-based companies that monitor the activities of people living in the EU.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Klout, the company that measured social media star-power, is shuttering May 25, ultimately done in by the new privacy regime coming to the internet: GDPR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sure, Klout had been losing clout as the arbiter of online status for some time, but it's not a coincidence that its shutdown is set for the day the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation takes effect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The upcoming deadline for GDPR implementation simply expedited our plans to sunset Klout,&quot; said Pete Hess, CEO of Lithium Technologies, which bought Klout in 2014.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new GDPR rules govern how companies can collect and use data. Companies, for instance, must obtain consent from consumers to do either.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Klout acquisition provided Lithium with valuable artificial intelligence and machine-learning capabilities but Klout as a standalone service is not aligned with our long-term strategy,&quot; Hess said in a note on the company's website. &quot;Our goal with these A.I. and machine-learning investments is to improve our customer care capabilities across the board, whether that's self-service, peer-to-peer, or direct-to-brand.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lithium is a global marketing technology firm that helps marketers manage customer relationships through software and social media-just the kind of company that's expected to be hit hardest by GDPR, because it has to operate on behalf of brands without its own consumer relationships.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Consumers have to say, 'Go ahead, use my information,' which in many cases might be innocuous, but it's one more thing to do,&quot; says Christina Allyn, partner at Moye White, a law firm that is helping clients navigate GDPR. &quot;For these ad-tracking companies, it's going to be a challenge.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Klout has also relied on people handing over access to their social media accounts on Facebook, Twitter and other platforms so it can track their activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That presented another challenge: the fallout from Facebook's recent privacy imbroglio. The social network has been under a microscope since it emerged that Cambridge Analytica, the data marketing firm, gained improper access to more than 80 million user profiles. Facebook subsequently tightened the rules over how outside companies could plug in and gain consumers' data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That might have been the final blow for Klout, according to Gil Eyal, CEO of Hypr Brands, a social influencer marketing and technology company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Klout never really justified the $200 million price Lithium paid for the company, Eyal says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The platform was flawed, and advertisers couldn't really rely on the score to evaluate if someone was significantly influential,&quot; Eyal says. &quot;While it paved the way for platforms like ours, it never really stood a chance and has not been a major factor for quite a while.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Klout invented the Klout Score, which for the past 10 years has professed to measure a person's online influence based on their social media habits. The score became a contentious marker of social media standing and sometimes punchline. Many technophiles saw it as a badge of honor, making it a goal to win Klout's highest rating by growing their social media accounts and staying active online.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Skeptics said Klout bestowed an undeserved sense of superiority on people for illusory achievements. At one point, some companies considered Klout scores as they weighed job applicants. Hotels upgraded guests with high Klout scores. Britney Spears went to the company's headquarters in San Francisco and demanded to know why her score was lower than Lady Gaga's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the industry around social influence evolved, however, brands got smarter about what mattered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Klout was largely based on who was most active on social versus who had an engaged audience that fit a brand's consumer base,&quot; says Ryan Detert, CEO of Influential, a company that matches brands with social media influencers. &quot;And influencers saw that someone who simply tweeted more often than them could have a higher Klout score, so they didn't put much stake in it.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vol. 1</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">No. 1</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">846  words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On average, only half of the companies in retail, financial services or technology and software feel they will be in compliance with the European Union'sGeneral Data Protection Regulationby the May 25 deadline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That doesn't mean that half of the companies haven't given any thought whatsoever to the new regulation that protects European consumer data. But it likely means they could end up in danger of fines that, at the high end, could be up to 20 million euros or 4% of a company's annual global revenue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a race to the finish line that also affects U.S. companies with European customers. In these final moments, every company must at least show good faith in attempting to follow the law and having procedures and technology in place to do so.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are weeks away and no one really knows to what extent or how quickly the EU will enforce it,&quot; said Steven Grossman, vice president of product management for Bay Dynamics, a cyber risk analytics company focusing on insider and third-party vendor threats. &quot;If a company hasn't given it the necessary attention up until now, they certainly won't be compliant overnight.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For any company that is behind, it must at least &quot;know what it needs to know,&quot; Grossman said. &quot;It's like a triage approach, like an emergency room in a hospital where you assess what you are looking at and put a plan together, addressing the greatest exposures and working your way down.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because the GDPR essentially affirms that European consumers &quot;own&quot; their data and companies have no right to store it longer than necessary or use it for any other purpose than its initial use, companies that handle or store data have much housekeeping to consider.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It will boil down to company policies and procedures for the most part, in addition to ongoing checks and balances, as well as stronger customer service to handle consumer inquiries regarding their data's location or planned use.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Various corporations and security companies have come to the forefront with services to help with GDPR compliance. Mastercard and IBM establishedIreland-based Truataas a trust to establish new standards in data hosting processes of anonymization andpseudonymizationthat come into play in assuring that parts of a consumer's full set of personal information or credentials are stored in different network silos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bay Dynamics offers cyber risk monitoring measures and best practices for data storage, while some companies are focusing on backup data software and other compliance measures to help ease the transition to GDPR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unlike similar security directives, such as the Payment Card Industry data security standards, the GDPR does not deliver instructions from the European Union regarding how companies should establish network configurations or fraud alert integration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By its nature, GDPR does not prescribe how you need to do things, it prescribes what you need to accomplish,&quot; Grossman said. &quot;It says something like 'you need to delete all personal data upon request,' but doesn't give directives on how to do so.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In some ways, that will make GDPR more effective, as there won't be one standard operating procedure that a fraudster could crack and then create havoc with multiple companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among many other facets, GDPR says companies have to obtain more explicit consumer permission before using personal information for marketing or advertising; they have to allow consumers to inspect the data they've collected and have it corrected on request; allow downloads of their data for the purpose of taking it to a competitor; and allow challenges of algorithmic decisions and requesting that humans make those decisions instead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To make sure a company can eventually get there, it immediately has to appoint someone responsible for the overall plan with a title of chief security or data privacy officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This type of person would not be responsible for the actual data privacy, but would be responsible for getting the company in the right place to meet regulations,&quot; Grossman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another key step in the final weeks is to make sure the company fully understands what consumer personal information it has on file, where it is stored, who is handling it and processing it and who has access. A company is also responsible for understanding what other third-party tech suppliers have the same data and how they are handling and protecting it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You can't protect what you don't know is there,&quot; Grossman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A documented plan with the highest priorities established as well as who is responsible for those tasks will go a long way toward being compliant, Grossman said. &quot;In this way, you can come to the regulators, say you know you are late, but we have done our assessment and this is our plan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More so than other data protection rules, GDPR will call for constant monitoring, follow-up and reporting because of the consumer data rights component. A company's customer service department must know how to answer questions about data use and storage upon request.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are always new processes and new places to store data, and you have to report those,&quot; Grossman said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday (May 9, 2018) was the deadline for the newNetwork and Information Security (NIS) Directiveto be transposed into EU member states' national legislation. This new regulation is aimed at creating a base level of security for organizations that are operating essential services within the EU.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The primary sectors covered by this regulation are: energy providers, transport, banking, financial services infrastructure, health, water and digital infrastructure providers. Organizations in this scope are termed &quot;operators of essential services&quot; and must implement the provisions of the directive to form the required base level of security for those services.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This EU directive was passed on July 6, 2016, and member states were given 21 months to transpose the directive into their national legislation, which is due today. While much of the preparation over the past two years was concerned with the building of capabilities at a member-state level, it is only now that the directive is going to start impacting your company directly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You will start to find out over the next six months whether you are in scope of the directive (by November 9, 2018 at the latest). Here are some of the key ways in which you will be impacted:</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><UL CLASS="c9"><LI CLASS="c10"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"><NOBR>&bull;</NOBR></SPAN></P>
<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Financial penalties for breaches of the directive. There are penalties for breaches impacting essential services. The UK's &pound;17 million maximum penalty has already made headlines for its size and scale. The size of the fine is not consistent across the EU, as each member state determines the maximum level of fine it will levy.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
</LI><LI CLASS="c10"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"><NOBR>&bull;</NOBR></SPAN></P>
<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mandatory security breach notification. Organizations will need to notify their designated competent authority of any breach that impacts the services they operate, not just those impacting personal data. Timeframes have not been specified, but some are suggesting mirroring the GDPR 72-hour breach notification requirement.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
</LI><LI CLASS="c10"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"><NOBR>&bull;</NOBR></SPAN></P>
<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of your breach data will be shared to help inform others. The breach data received by operators may be distributed to other EU member states through threat intelligence sharing channels. This sharing of information to help other, similar operators is a new and potentially interesting expansion that could take cross-EU cyber cooperation up a level.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
</LI><LI CLASS="c10"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"><NOBR>&bull;</NOBR></SPAN></P>
<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You may need to adjust or implement new security controls. The directive calls for a base level of security controls to be implemented, dependent on the assessment of the key risks facing an organization's services.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
</LI><LI CLASS="c10"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"><NOBR>&bull;</NOBR></SPAN></P>
<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You will need to take steps to manage your supply chain. While not directly in the scope of the NIS Directive, operators of essential services are expected to assure themselves that their supply chain abides by the same standards that they do.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
</LI><LI CLASS="c10"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"><NOBR>&bull;</NOBR></SPAN></P>
<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Digital service providers are particularly impacted. For the first time, there is an explicit recognition in cyber regulation that many companies and citizens are highly reliant on cloud computing services and digital search facilities. This obliges some of the largest American-based organizations providing software-as-a-service (SaaS) to comply with the NIS Directive.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The good news is that most organizations already had most of what is required in place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have some concerns about the way that the directive is being applied across Europe, which I think creates potential difficulties for organizations impacted by it:</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><UL CLASS="c9"><LI CLASS="c10"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"><NOBR>&bull;</NOBR></SPAN></P>
<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As NIS is a directive rather than a regulation, it is up to member states to determine how they apply it. This means that different EU member states will have different implementations of required security controls. If your organization operates in multiple jurisdictions, you will need to manage a complex set of potentially competing requirements for demonstrating NIS compliance.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
</LI><LI CLASS="c10"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"><NOBR>&bull;</NOBR></SPAN></P>
<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For fines involving personal data, the GDPR will also apply. A significant concern for your organization would be whether so-called NIS Directive/GDPR &quot;double jeopardy&quot; is an issue. While it is expected that both the applicable NIS competent authority and the relevant GDPR data protection regulator would both wish to investigate, I believe that in these cases one regulator should be designated as the primary authority for the purposes of levying a penalty to ensure that the organization is not punished twice for the same breach.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
</LI><LI CLASS="c10"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"><NOBR>&bull;</NOBR></SPAN></P>
<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, while it allows maximum choice to member states, the ability of each to either select a single centralized authority or adopt a sectoral approach involving multiple regulators will only create confusion for organizations with operations in multiple jurisdictions as to how and whom they report to in which country. A centralized approach to management of competent authorities would have been a simpler approach.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I will be undertaking research later in the year to understand how organizations are getting on with NIS Directive implementation and how member states are applying it.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Bloomberg) -- This month, the European Union will embark on an expansive effort to give people more control over their data online. Known as the General Data Protection Regulation, it's ambitious, well-intentioned and largely wrongheaded. As it comes into force, Europe should be mindful of unintended consequences - and open to change when things go wrong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No one could say the GDPR lacks purpose. At more than 260 pages long, it articulates dozens of goals in the service of &quot;a strong and more coherent data protection framework.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meeting these ambitions will be the job of companies - wherever they're located - that process the data of European citizens. Among other things, they'll need to obtain consent from users; explain how their data will be used; allow people to see what's been swooped up; and permit them, at any moment, to withdraw their consent or demand that their data be deleted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given the public backlash against data collection - and support for the GDPR's stated goals - this approach might seem reasonable. But look more closely and the drawbacks are glaring.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most obvious are the costs. By one estimate, big multinationals will spend $7.8 billion simply preparing for the GDPR. They'll need to hire compliance staff, compile voluminous documentation, handsomely pay lawyers and consultants, and in many cases rethink their business models and retool their technologies. Failure to comply could result in fines of up to 4 percent of global revenue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Surely Facebook and Google can afford such costs, you might say. Yet this, too, is a problem: The GDPR is likely to advantage big tech companies at the expense of smaller ones. Few small businesses will be able to fully comply with these rules, while many of them will suffer from having less effective advertising. Europe's dearth of notable startups will hardly improve.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Worse, the rules could impede innovation. Many blockchain companies could be shut out entirely. Cloud computing may become substantially more complicated. Systems that rely on artificial intelligence could in many cases be incompatible with the GDPR's mandates. It's an ominous sign that Facebook has already started pulling some data projects from Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet all this is more or less by design; there will also be unintended consequences. Although the GDPR aims to improve data security, for instance, its privacy rules may compromise a crucial tool used by security researchers, thereby increasing spam, phishing attacks and malware. Its compliance costs could inhibit cybersecurity investment. Its emphasis on obtaining consent for data collection is, in practice, likely to mean endless &quot;click to proceed&quot; boxes that leave customers little more informed - and significantly more irritated - than before.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For all these drawbacks, the EU deserves credit for illuminating - and attempting to resolve - a very real problem. European law enshrines a right to privacy. Yet the digital economy depends on invasive data collection. In forcing matters, the GDPR makes plain a worldwide tension: People have come to expect free online services as well as unencumbered privacy. Unfortunately, they can't have both.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are many ways to approach this dilemma, and no solution will be universal. But in general, the goals should be transparent pricing and more competition. The GDPR's requirement that personal information be &quot;portable&quot; - that a user can take her data from one service to another that treats it more responsibly - is on the right track. It would be even better to encourage companies to explicitly charge for privacy, which would give users a better sense of what their data is worth and ensure that their consent is more informed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Europe leaps into the unknown on this issue, it must be alert to the many downsides of its approach, and prepared to rethink things that aren't working.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just like your possessions, there are those who value your private information. Wide sweeps of DNA data are analogous to the NSA's wide sweep of phone numbers.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c6">Private communications are intervened without control in Mexico</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">2013  words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All mobile phone users in Mexico are suspects and that implies that our private communications can be violated. Mexican authorities made 75,978 requests to telephone companies to offer information of their customers in 2017. There were 200 daily requirements for operators to collaborate providing data related to the use of telephone lines or the real-time geographic location of the connected device. to the public telecommunications network. Thousands of requests were made without meeting the requirements of law, but operators prefer not to discuss: if an authority asks for it, it is delivered. Even if the requesting authority is constitutionally impeded, or if the official requesting it was not designated through an agreement in the Official Gazette of the Federation, as the norm dictates, or if the authority it represents is only identified as &quot;FG&quot;, &quot;TSJ&quot;, &quot;PGJ&quot;, &quot;JCA&quot;, &quot;JC-JO&quot; or, simply, &quot;other&quot;. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Among the most striking cases is the Prosecutor's Office of Puebla, which made 3,418 requests for conserved data and location in real time in 2017, according to the reports that operators must submit to the Federal Institute of Telecommunications (IFT) each semester. More than half of those requests were made in May, the most violent month in the fight against the huachicoleros, as the criminal gangs are known to extract fuel from the Pemex pipelines. There were 1,921 requirements to the operators. The theft of hydrocarbons is a crime of the federal jurisdiction; according to data from Pemex delivered to the Senate of the Republic, this state company filed 10,078 complaints in 2017 related to fuel theft, 88.5% went unpunished. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another case is that of the Specialized Prosecutor's Office for the Attention of Electoral Crimes (Fepade), which depends on the PGR. Constitutional Article 16 helps to delimit the scope of the intervention of private communications: they are prohibited &quot;in the case of matters of an electoral, fiscal, commercial, civil, labor or administrative nature, nor in the case of the communications of the detainee with his defender This was not an obstacle for La Fepade, when it was directed by Santiago Nieto Castillo, to request information about an Axtel client in March and about two Megacable clients in April. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Ministry of the Navy, the Ministry of Public Security of Chiapas and the prosecutors' offices of Aguascalientes, Campeche, Chihuahua, Durango, Hidalgo, Nayarit, San Luis Potosi, Sinaloa and Veracruz carried out a total of 7,467 requirements (almost 10% of the total). None of these instances has published the decree to appoint those responsible for managing requests for collaboration to operators, as ordered by the standard published by the IFT on December 2, 2015. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are three types of requirements of authorities related to private communications: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">1.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of data and metadata, which the Supreme Court determined protected by the right to the inviolability of private communications and which, to be valid, must be authorized by a judge; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">2.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> geographic location in real time (knowing where a telephone device is located immediately), which can be requested without authorization from a judge when there is a need to protect the life and integrity of the persons or when the object of the crime is at risk or it may disappear, and </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">3.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> content intervention (that an authority has access, for example, to the WhatsApp of acitizen and read their messages), which must be authorized by a judge. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The analysis of data and metadata allows to create very accurate profiles about the users of the lines, such as identifying their circle of closest social relations and the social media they frequent, knowing the places of permanent or temporary residence, knowing where they spend the night or document their habits of daily life. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The authorities not identified or registered by the operators with inaccuracies were the ones that made the most requests during 2017: 16,993, with a percentage of receiving information of 91.44 percent. Out of every 10 requests, the operators collaborated in 9 cases. The Attorney General's Office (SEIDO, AIC, Cenapi and Fepade) followed, with 14,780 requests and an information reception rate of 96%; the Prosecutor's Office of the State of Mexico (5,642 requests, 98.12% of receipt); the Attorney General's Office of Mexico City (5,322 requests, 97.73% of receipt); the Attorney General of Puebla (3,418 requests, 99.53% of receipt) and the Attorney General of Veracruz (2,969 requests, 98.28% of receipt). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Of the 75,978 requirements of security and justice authorities registered by operators during 2017, 73,609 were requests to access data and metadata and 2,369 to geolocation in real time. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The lack of transparency on the part of the authorities and operators on how applications are processed limits the possibility of evaluating whether the use of this tool, which was repealed by the European Union four years ago as a serious and disproportionate interference with the right to privacy, it is an effective means to achieve successful investigations. The IFT is responsible for following up the collaboration of the operators and little help to give certainty: it does not have a directory of designated authorities nor does it comply with its part of putting the semi-annual reports online. Neither did it design measures to punish operators that do not submit their reports or to verify if the information delivered is true. An IFT comment was requested for this article, but the regulator preferred to remain silent. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7"> The collaboration of the operators </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The obligatory collaboration of the operators with the security and justice authorities is a tool of the Mexican State for - says the spirit of the norm - to guarantee public security, national security and to make an effective justice procurement. It was put into operation in Mexico at the same time as in Europe a similar directive was derogated, described as &quot;especially serious&quot; for &quot;the fundamental rights to respect for privacy and the protection of personal data&quot;. In Mexico, this violation of rights does not bother the legislators or the ministers of the Supreme Court: the norms that allow collaboration have been validated on different occasions (the most recent was on March 20). And although the controls for the use of the tool have been strengthened, which probably reduced the requests for collaboration last year (3,412 fewer requests were made in 2017 than in 2016), lack of control persists. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Am&eacute;rica M&oacute;vil is a paradigmatic case of how operators react to requirements. Am&eacute;rica M&oacute;vil, which controls Telcel, Telmex and Telnor, received almost 7 out of 10 requests for collaboration in 2017 -57,677 of the 75,978 registered in 2017. The company collaborated in 100% of the cases; 9,245 applications (16% of the total) were made by unidentified authorities. HeEconomist sent a questionnaire to Am&eacute;rica M&oacute;vil to know how it processes the requirements; the answer was 24 words: &quot;Everything is answered according to the requirements or raised in the guidelines and Title Eight of the Federal Telecommunications and Broadcasting Law&quot;. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AT &amp; T received 11,554 requirements in 2017 and collaborated in 8 out of 10. 60% of the total requirements to AT &amp; T were made by unidentified authorities. Consulted for this article, the company offered a generic response through a spokesperson: &quot;At AT &amp; T M&eacute;xico we take the privacy of our clients very seriously; it's a fundamental commitment to the way we do business globally. &quot; Telef&oacute;nica's Movistar was the third operator with the most requests: 6,303, and collaborated in 9 out of 10 cases. &quot;Telef&oacute;nica M&eacute;xico has always collaborated with the authorities with strict adherence to the applicable obligations in the legal norms in force in our country. (...) In case the authority does not comply with the requirements established in the Legislation, the information is not delivered, &quot;the company reported. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7"> The communications intervention </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The interference caused by the indiscriminate retention of personal data through telecommunications services &quot;is of great magnitude and should be considered especially serious,&quot; said the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) in a ruling that led to the creation of a new policy for the protection of personal data, the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), which will come into force on May 25, 2018. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Mexico, the great reform to the telecommunications sector of 2013 and 2014 maintained in the legislation the obligation of the operators to collaborate with the security and justice authorities. The technology allows it: each activation of the communication equipment produces data and metadata that are used by the operator to guarantee the communicative process and to invoice the customer service; that information contains personal data, because it identifies or makes a person identifiable (Inai, PPD.0050 / 16 of July 13, 2016), and is under the protection of the right to the inviolability of private communications. &quot;The object of constitutional protection of the right to the inviolability of private communications (...) does not refer only to the communication process, but also to those data that identify the communication. (...) The registration of the numbers dialed by a user of the telephone network, the identity of the callers, the duration of the telephone call or the identification of an Internet protocol (IP) address, carried out without the Necessary guarantees for the restriction of the fundamental right to secrecy of communications, can cause their violation, &quot;says the Thesis 1a. CLV / 2011 of the Supreme Court of August 2011. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In total there are 11 informative blocks that must be available to the authority during a period of 24 months from the moment in which the communication was generated, in accordance with Title Eight of the Federal Telecommunications and Broadcasting Law (LFTR) and regulated by some guidelines issued by the IFT on December 2, 2015. The list includes the most basic data, such as the name and address of the client, up to data on communications traffic: the type ofcommunication, the origin and destination numbers, the duration, date and time of the communication or the location tag (cell identifier). With these data you can make inferences about social relationships and the most intimate circle of the user of the line, the routines of travel or where the night passes and when it leaves the city. &quot;It is not necessary in any way to analyze the content of the communication, or its circumstances, to determine its protection by the fundamental right&quot;, says the Thesis 1a. CLV / 2011 of the Court. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The reform of Enrique Pe&ntilde;a Nieto, with which the LFTR was created and the Federal Telecommunications Law of 1995 was repealed, avoided delimiting the subjects for the use of the collaboration tool: the previous law was explicit in pointing out that the geographical location in Real time could only be used &quot;with investigations on organized crime, crimes against health, kidnapping, extortion or threats&quot; and access to data kept in &quot;extortion, threats, kidnapping, in any of its forms or any crime serious or related to organized crime, in their respective competences &quot;. This was ratified by the Supreme Court in resolving the Unconstitutionality Action 32/2012. Something similar happened in the design of article 303 of the National Code of Criminal Procedure (CNPP) that was in force between March 5, 2014 and June 17, 2016; the legislator &quot;forgot&quot; to specify the criminal matters in which the geolocation could be used in real time. The Court invalidated the expired article on March 20, 2018 and validated the use of geolocation for the investigation of specific crimes. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The most that legislators and judges have come to protect the rights to privacy and the protection of personal data with the use of this tool is to provide it with action guides for specific situations, guides that the operators and authorities themselves systematically fail, evidencing that in Mexico private communications are intervened without control. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The lack of transparency on the part of the authorities and operators on how applications are processed limits the possibility of evaluating whether the use of this tool, which was repealed by the European Union four years ago as a serious and disproportionate interference with the right to privacy, it is an effective means to achieve successful investigations. The IFT is responsible for following up the collaboration of the operators and little help to give certainty: it does not have a directory of designated authorities nor does it comply with its part of putting the semi-annual reports online. Neither did it design measures to punish operators that do not submit their reports or to verify if the information delivered is true. An IFT comment was requested for this article, but the regulator preferred to remain silent. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7"> The collaboration of the operators </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The obligatory collaboration of the operators with the security and justice authorities is a tool of the Mexican State for - says the spirit of the norm - to guarantee public security, national security and to make an effective justice procurement. It was put into operation in Mexico at the same time as in Europe a similar directive was derogated, described as &quot;especially serious&quot; for &quot;the fundamental rights to respect for privacy and the protection of personal data&quot;. In Mexico, this violation of rights does not bother the legislators or the ministers of the Supreme Court: the norms that allow collaboration have been validated on different occasions (the most recent was on March 20). And although the controls for the use of the tool have been strengthened, which probably reduced the requests for collaboration last year (3,412 fewer requests were made in 2017 than in 2016), lack of control persists. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Am&eacute;rica M&oacute;vil is a paradigmatic case of how operators react to requirements. Am&eacute;rica M&oacute;vil, which controls Telcel, Telmex and Telnor, received almost 7 out of 10 requests for collaboration in 2017 -57,677 of the 75,978 registered in 2017. The company collaborated in 100% of the cases; 9,245 applications (16% of the total) were made by unidentified authorities. HeEconomist sent a questionnaire to Am&eacute;rica M&oacute;vil to know how it processes the requirements; the answer was 24 words: &quot;Everything is answered according to the requirements or raised in the guidelines and Title Eight of the Federal Telecommunications and Broadcasting Law&quot;. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AT &amp; T received 11,554 requirements in 2017 and collaborated in 8 out of 10. 60% of the total requirements to AT &amp; T were made by unidentified authorities. Consulted for this article, the company offered a generic response through a spokesperson: &quot;At AT &amp; T M&eacute;xico we take the privacy of our clients very seriously; it's a fundamental commitment to the way we do business globally. &quot; Telef&oacute;nica's Movistar was the third operator with the most requests: 6,303, and collaborated in 9 out of 10 cases. &quot;Telef&oacute;nica M&eacute;xico has always collaborated with the authorities with strict adherence to the applicable obligations in the legal norms in force in our country. (...) In case the authority does not comply with the requirements established in the Legislation, the information is not delivered, &quot;the company reported. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7"> The communications intervention </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The interference caused by the indiscriminate retention of personal data through telecommunications services &quot;is of great magnitude and should be considered especially serious,&quot; said the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) in a ruling that led to the creation of a new policy for the protection of personal data, the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), which will come into force on May 25, 2018. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Mexico, the great reform to the telecommunications sector of 2013 and 2014 maintained in the legislation the obligation of the operators to collaborate with the security and justice authorities. The technology allows it: each activation of the communication equipment produces data and metadata that are used by the operator to guarantee the communicative process and to invoice the customer service; that information contains personal data, because it identifies or makes a person identifiable (Inai, PPD.0050 / 16 of July 13, 2016), and is under the protection of the right to the inviolability of private communications. &quot;The object of constitutional protection of the right to the inviolability of private communications (...) does not refer only to the communication process, but also to those data that identify the communication. (...) The registration of the numbers dialed by a user of the telephone network, the identity of the callers, the duration of the telephone call or the identification of an Internet protocol (IP) address, carried out without the Necessary guarantees for the restriction of the fundamental right to secrecy of communications, can cause their violation, &quot;says the Thesis 1a. CLV / 2011 of the Supreme Court of August 2011. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In total there are 11 informative blocks that must be available to the authority during a period of 24 months from the moment in which the communication was generated, in accordance with Title Eight of the Federal Telecommunications and Broadcasting Law (LFTR) and regulated by some guidelines issued by the IFT on December 2, 2015. The list includes the most basic data, such as the name and address of the client, up to data on communications traffic: the type ofcommunication, the origin and destination numbers, the duration, date and time of the communication or the location tag (cell identifier). With these data you can make inferences about social relationships and the most intimate circle of the user of the line, the routines of travel or where the night passes and when it leaves the city. &quot;It is not necessary in any way to analyze the content of the communication, or its circumstances, to determine its protection by the fundamental right&quot;, says the Thesis 1a. CLV / 2011 of the Court. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The reform of Enrique Pe&ntilde;a Nieto, with which the LFTR was created and the Federal Telecommunications Law of 1995 was repealed, avoided delimiting the subjects for the use of the collaboration tool: the previous law was explicit in pointing out that the geographical location in Real time could only be used &quot;with investigations on organized crime, crimes against health, kidnapping, extortion or threats&quot; and access to data kept in &quot;extortion, threats, kidnapping, in any of its forms or any crime serious or related to organized crime, in their respective competences &quot;. This was ratified by the Supreme Court in resolving the Unconstitutionality Action 32/2012. Something similar happened in the design of article 303 of the National Code of Criminal Procedure (CNPP) that was in force between March 5, 2014 and June 17, 2016; the legislator &quot;forgot&quot; to specify the criminal matters in which the geolocation could be used in real time. The Court invalidated the expired article on March 20, 2018 and validated the use of geolocation for the investigation of specific crimes. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The most that legislators and judges have come to protect the rights to privacy and the protection of personal data with the use of this tool is to provide it with action guides for specific situations, guides that the operators and authorities themselves systematically fail, evidencing that in Mexico private communications are intervened without control. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1032 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When users practice learning Spanish on the free Duolingo app, the East Liberty company collects data on which words they know well, when they use the app, how many lessons are completed in that session and the type of device being used.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's key stuff, said Carl Gottlieb, who has served as data protection officer for the language learning company since November. It helps the research team improve the course and to keep the app from crashing on the company's global audience of 200 million.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the European Union's rules on how Duolingo discloses all that to users in the 24-country bloc will be changing this month and the penalties for getting it wrong are hefty - up to $24 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, a slate of laws meant to help consumers gain more control over their data, goes into effect May 25.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the go-live date looms near, data-hoarding firms like Facebook and Google, as well as a cartel of smaller firms, are sending out masses of emails and in-app notifications to let users know the terms of service and that data policies are changing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Companies are working to give consumers a clear understanding of how their data is being used and collected under the new laws. That means no confusing legal speak and no little box to click, proving that you've read the terms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are giving you better ways to access your data and understand how it's used,&quot; reads an email from the Instagram social media team. The company explained how it watches users taps and scrolls to distinguish them from bots and how it shares information with partners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the new regs are a bid to make it easier for EU citizens to understand how their data is being used, the rules will influence how U.S.-based companies operate if they have a global user base - and most tech companies do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're only getting splashed with some of the water,&quot; said Richard Franklin, professor emeritus of business administration at the University of Pittsburgh. &quot;Though inevitably there are going to be some things that companies are going to do to make their lives easier and more consistent on a global basis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Franklin, who teaches information systems and technology management, said that in the U.S., the impact of the new rules will mostly be felt by businesses trying to comply. The rules are catching up not only to big companies like Facebook and Google but also startups like Duolingo and publishers like the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's &quot;complicated and messy&quot; to become GDPR-compliant, Mr. Franklin said. Most will hire a consulting company to take on the burden. Some may block users from EU addresses to avoid the risk of not complying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the new laws, companies must allow users to permanently delete their accounts and all data associated with them, rather than just deactivating the account; users can request a copy of all information a firm has on them, and the company has to provide it for free; and companies must explain why they're collecting data and what it's being used for, among other items.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Firms must strike harmony between giving users meaningful control and also maintaining their own standards for operation and monetization. After all, companies like Duolingo and Facebook primarily rely on advertising, a data-driven business, to turn a profit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If I were an entrepreneur, that would be something I'd be concerned about,&quot; Mr. Franklin said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since 1995, the EU has been creating comprehensive laws around data practices, according to Mr. Franklin. Back in the age of dial-up internet, there was no Facebook and no extensive data collection, but firms did have digital records about their customers and transactions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new GDPR rules, he posits, are a response to changes in the world since 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the U.S., he said, there are no such blanket rules at the federal level. Data practices must follow a patchwork of state laws. There are two exceptions: HIPAA, an information privacy law to protect patients, and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, a 1999 act that focused on deregulation in the financial services industry and prevented banks from sharing personal information with marketers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result, scenarios play out where dozens of attorneys general sue a firm over a data breach because each state has its own standards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In March, for example, Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro sued Uber after 13,500 Pennsylvania Uber drivers were impacted by a 2016 data breach and the company kept the hack quiet for more than a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under GDPR, Uber would have to disclose a breach in European countries within 72 hours and its terms of service should note that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not all data policies or terms of service were created equally, according to the user transparency organization &quot;Terms of Service; Didn't Read&quot; (ToS;DR), playfully named after the internet acronym TL;DR which stands for &quot;too long; didn't read.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TOS;DR formed in June 2012 to address what it calls &quot;the biggest lie on the internet,&quot; or the idea that a website or app's users have actually read and digested terms of service before clicking &quot;I agree.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On its site, a handful of companies are given a rating from &quot;Class A,&quot; which means the website's terms and privacy policy are agreeable, to &quot;Class E,&quot; the equivalent of receiving a failing grade on a term paper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you can't delete your account, that's a blocker,&quot; said Chris Talib, a freelance software developer and volunteer member of ToS;DR based in Brussels, Belgium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">YouTube earned Class D status because its terms and conditions may be changed at any point without notifying the user and deleted videos are not really deleted, among other items. Google was placed in Class C since it keeps your searches and other identifiable user information for an undefined period of time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook, Amazon and Twitter have not yet been rated. Mr. Talib said the organization can only rate a few companies at a time, piece by piece, because it is volunteer-based.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After Cambridge Analytica, we can see not only that we are surveyed and watched every step and click, but that there are real consequences,&quot; he said. &quot;Even if you have nothing to hide or fear ... the choices you're making are not yours anymore once they're on the databases of those companies.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the EU prepares to roll out new data protection regulations this month, concerns are emerging that they could dissuade businesses from rolling out blockchain-based projects because the online transaction technology might innately break the new rules.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) targets citizens' personally identifiable information (PII), providing transparency around its use and giving people the right to restrict its use or request it be deleted all together.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[ Related: The top 5 problems with blockchain ]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While GDPR never mentions PII, the new rules describing &quot;personal data&quot; are synonymous with it: &quot;Any information that relates to an identified or identifiable living individual. Different pieces of information, which collected together can lead to the identification of a particular person, also constitute personal data.&quot; In short, it means any data that can be tied back to person's identity.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blockchain, which has taken the business world by storm, is an online electronic distributed ledger technology that can create an immutable record for recording a history of transactions; therefore, if blockchain were to be used as a type of database to transact with PII, it would by default run afoul of GDPR rules. Blockchain ledgers can be added to, but information on the network cannot be modified or deleted. It's a write-once, append-many technology.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How blockchain could run afoul of GDPR</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gerry Stegmaier, a partner in the IP, Tech &amp; Data Group of Washington-based law firm Reed Smith, said blockchain's greatest attribute - its characteristic as an unchangeable record that creates trust and a perfect auditing trail - could also be its biggest downfall from a rules perspective.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Regulators are unlikely to accept the argument that somehow blockchain is exempt from GDPR strictures because a defining feature of distributed ledgers is the impossibility of deleting data, such that it cannot be deployed in a way that enables data deletion,&quot; Stegmaier said in an email. &quot;Those kinds of arguments haven't resonated well with regulators.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In general, technology development, for better or worse, has not been at the forefront of data protection policy development in Europe, Stegmaier added. Few regulators have technologists on staff, &quot;and even fewer are technologists themselves.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others, however, argue that blockchain is not innately at odds with data privacy protection and can actually offer some of the industry's best available data protection methodologies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gennaro Cuomo, an IBM fellow and vice president of the company's Blockchain Technologies unit, explained that not all blockchain technology is created equal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For broad business and government use, enterprise blockchain technology is now available that solves four fundamental requirements: accountability, privacy, scalability and security,&quot; Cuomo said in an email.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In February, Cuomo testified before a congressional subcommittee on blockchain as a transformational building block for many types of business and government communication; he emphasized that bitcoin and other forms of cryptocurrency are but one use of blockchain, just as social media is but one use of the internet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How blockchain can support GDPR</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company released a white paper that explains blockchain can support GDPR. However, the company notes, personal data should never be stored on the blockchain, and a lot of people don't understand that and continue to do it for all sorts of use cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IBM runs a blockchain cloud service and consulting business, which is being used by international corporations to share digital records - everything from cross-border payments to tracking cargo shipments and supply chain management.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are two forms of blockchain: public and private (or permissioned). Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies use public blockchains, meaning there is no central authority and anyone can see the information on the electronic ledgers. The ledgers, however, also offer anonymity for users because the financial transactions are tied to hashes, meaning the origin of the data is encrypted and only accessible through a hash key. Those keys belong only to the users and the financial institution backing the transactions. If a user were to lose his or her key, they also would lose access to their data and bitcoins.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Businesses are mainly interested in private or permissioned blockchains, where a central authority governs who is authorized to partake in the electronic ledger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While blockchain technology allows for information to be stored in the same way it might be in a database, information can also be stored &quot;off chain&quot; in a separate database and linked to the blockchain via private and public cryptographic keys.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The emerging standard industry approach is to avoid having personal data directly on a blockchain, store any such data in editable databases and then only have a one-way hash of that data stored on the blockchain itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Keeping blockchain and personal data apart</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a report released last month, Forrester Research said blockchain is ideal for meeting new government data privacy requirements and serving as a trusted repository for identification purposes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Personally-identifiable information should never, ever be stored on a blockchain-based network,&quot; said Martha Bennett, a principal analyst at Forrester Research and co-author of the report. &quot;Companies linking PII to on-chain records need to have mechanisms in place that allow that link to be broken irrevocably.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, for example, if somebody exercises their &quot;right to be forgotten,&quot; not only will database records have to be deleted but a business blockchain administrator will also need to ensure that any &quot;on-chain&quot; records become meaningless.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deleting hash keys tied to information is known as cryptographic data deletion because while the data may still exist, spread across offline databases, it cannot be reassembled without the correct cryptographic keys. In a sense, it becomes gibberish.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blockchain-based systems can also be part of the solution to new GDPR rules, Bennett argued. For example, the systems can be used to track consent as well as the fulfillment of deletion requests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GDPR is a new data protection framework that applies to nations in the EU; it gives citizens more control over how their personal data is used and imposes strict rules on entities hosting and &quot;processing&quot; this personally identifiable information anywhere in the world. (Because so many U.S.-based companies also have operations in Europe, they too are rushing to comply with the changes.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just as in a public blockchain, permissioned blockchains have the ability to offer anonymity: only those transacting on the network can see the information; and, even those on the network can be restricted from seeing other's participant's information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In an enterprise-ready blockchain, participants are known and are identified by membership keys,&quot; Cuomo said. &quot;The data can be trusted because transactions committed to the ledger are immutable - such that they cannot be removed or changed by the actions of a single party. With this accountability, the network is auditable, allowing members to follow and adhere to existing government regulations like HIPAA and GDPR.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blockchain and PII</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Far from restricting blockchain's use, the Congressional Blockchain Caucus is working to collect information on blockchain projects that could help individuals securely establish their identity, enable online payments - such as tax payments - and revamp supply chains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IBM is a founding member of the Sovrin Foundation, a nonprofit organization now developing the Sovrin Network, which could enable anyone to globally exchange pre-verified data with any entity also on the network. With blockchain, identity theft and fraud can be significantly reduced while the effectiveness of government-mandated Know-Your-Customer and Anti-Money Laundering rules is enhanced, the Sovrin Foundation claims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Online credentials would be akin to information a person might have with them: a driver's license, a bank debit card or a company ID.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead of a physical card, however, the IDs in digital wallets would be encrypted and link back to the institutions that created them, such as a bank, a government or even an employer. Through the blockchain, those entities could automatically verify &nbsp;information to a requestor without providing any other details.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, a bank could request a customer verify they earn more than $50,000 a year for the purpose of a home loan; the customer's employer who is part of the blockchain network, could then verify their employee makes at least that amount without releasing their exact salary. The entire transaction would be run by a blockchain business automation tool known as a smart contract.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Applying the GDPR to blockchain technology is going to be a nuanced process as the nature of the many existing and emerging blockchains themselves are quite nuanced, according to Judd Bagley, a spokesman for Evernym, a company that develops self-sovereign identity applications that run on the Sovrin network.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For example, some blockchains accept and immutably maintain personal information and others do not. Certainly, those that are open to being written to by anybody - such as the permissionless bitcoin blockchain - could potentially have anything added to them with no mechanism in place for removal,&quot; Bagley said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blockchains built with privacy and GDPR compliance in mind, however, have a clear advantage. The Sovrin ledger, for example, doesn't store personal data. Instead, Sovrin acts like a directory of pointers to an individual's data, stored in more traditional, centralized databases, and takes additional steps to implement the GDPR's privacy by design and default principles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Sovrin approach is actually a dream for GDPR compliance for other reasons,&quot; Bagley said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Wheeler's rules did little to protect Americans on basic privacy issues<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler recently&nbsp;penned an opinion piece&nbsp;for&nbsp;The New York&nbsp;Times&nbsp;arguing that, in the wake of the revelation that Facebook's loose policies impacted the data privacy of millions of users, the answer is to follow Europe's lead on privacy.&nbsp;Quite simply, Wheeler is wrong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wheeler notes that &quot;The American government has done little to help us&quot; on privacy protection.&nbsp;Indeed, and that was certainly true when he was chairman of the FCC.&nbsp;His 2015 rules moving regulation of broadband to Title II of the Telecommunications Act failed to address the actual problem he describes. In fact, his preferred rules were in place during the 2016 campaign when Cambridge Analytica attempted to sway voters using data from an estimated 87 million Facebook accounts - a fact Wheeler omits from his piece. But Wheeler's rules, while targeting a handful of companies, imposed no requirements on Internet edge providers like Facebook.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rather than demonstrating leadership by advocating broad Internet user privacy protections, applicable across the span of the Internet ecosystem, he chose a path of one-sided regulation. His rules targeted only one group of companies (Internet Service Providers), which collect far less customer data than Internet edge providers that have an advertising business model grounded on the preference profiles they assemble from data collected about their users.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Europe has chosen a highly intrusive regulatory regime in the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which will go into effect in late May.&nbsp;If transposed into the American context, as Wheeler espouses, the practical effect would be to harm the advertising business model of Internet edge providers. It is that model which enables the bulk of Internet content to be free or priced at a very low cost within the reach of most Internet users.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GDPR requires affirmative &quot;opt in&quot; consent before websites operating in Europe can collect data from their users. Unless website users take the affirmative step of clicking a box giving permission for the website operator to collect information about them, no information can be collected. Given human nature and the reality that most people would never bother to give affirmative consent for data collection, the preference profiles that enable targeted advertising could not be assembled and used. It's really hard to see how this kind of regulation benefits consumers, because it inevitably would make Internet content less available and far more costly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's why there is no need to follow Europe in the path of highly intrusive regulation but instead to enact comprehensive legislation here, adopting an approach that will give consumers meaningful information about and control over the information that is collected from them, while at the same time preserving the advertising model that keeps content either free or highly affordable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those goals can be achieved by adoption of legislation making explicit the Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) authority to protect&nbsp;privacy.&nbsp; Such legislation could also incorporate open internet principles that apply no blocking or throttling of legitimate online content to all providers in the Internet ecosystem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">        Opinion: Why voters should oppose recall of Judge Aaron Persky     </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">        George Miller: Climate change is this generations defining issue     </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">        Opinion: Why state should fully fund disabled housing program for victims of elder abuse     </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">        How Silicon Valley can prevent earthquake catastrophe     </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">        Opinion: Why Bay Area schools must improve lockdown procedures      </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consumers would have the benefit of a consistent set of privacy rules applicable across the entire Internet ecosystem, including both ISPs and edge providers.&nbsp;They would receive a clear statement of what data is collected and how it is used, and would be provided an easy ability to opt out of making that data available to a particular company or app.&nbsp;Consumers who are particularly concerned about protecting their privacy would be given the convenient means of doing so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The result will protect consumers' privacy directly, without harming innovation or investment throughout the Internet ecosystem and treating all companies the same, so that consumers have one standard of what to expect for the protection of their privacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Americans invented the Internet.&nbsp;We are still the world's leaders, as the very success of companies like Google, Facebook, Apple, and Amazon shows.&nbsp;Our network systems operators invest far more than their European counterparts in bringing ever-faster broadband to individuals and businesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just as we have historically led global Internet development, the United States should also be a global privacy leader, adopting an approach that works for us and offers a model for the balance of the world. The best way forward is for Congress to pass a law enacting strong privacy protections that apply equally to&nbsp;everyone&nbsp;in the Internet ecosystem - network systems operators, edge providers and app companies - and applies no matter how one accesses the broadband Internet.&nbsp;Congress can pass that law this year - and avoid both special treatment for some companies while imposing severe requirements on others and the overly broad policy that Europe is about to impose.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Larry Alton</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vol. 1</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">No. 1</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">850  words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Data visualization is being hailed as the next great revolution in data analytics. But besides the fancy name and the slick-looking graphs produced by the technology, how can this new addition improve your already-efficient organization?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If harnessed correctly, data visualization has the power to improve your company's productivity, client relationships and profitability all at once.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But how?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let's start by dissecting the core strengths and effects of data visualization. Assuming all other factors (including staff, data sources, etc.) are equal, data visualization has the potential to add the following:</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><UL CLASS="c9"><LI CLASS="c10"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"><NOBR>&bull;</NOBR></SPAN></P>
<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Interpretability. The hallmark improvement offered by data visualization is its interpretability. In other words, a set of data illustrated in a visual chart is much easier to understand than a complex spreadsheet containing the same information in a numerical format. This makes the process of data analysis more accessible and faster, to a wider range of users.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
</LI><LI CLASS="c10"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"><NOBR>&bull;</NOBR></SPAN></P>
<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speed. Data visualizations themselves aren't exactly new; we've been using charts and graphs for hundreds of years. The big difference here is leveraging platforms that can quickly and precisely adjust those visualizations to account for new variables, different conditions, and other customizations requested by a user. The production element has hastened significantly.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
</LI><LI CLASS="c10"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"><NOBR>&bull;</NOBR></SPAN></P>
<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Utility. We should also consider the near-universal utility of data visualization, since it can be used in almost anything, from studying demographic trends to analyzing employee productivity. This means you can harness the power of data visualization for almost any department or application, provided you have information to study.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Key effects to harness</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, how can you apply these advantages in a way that improves your entire organization?</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><UL CLASS="c9"><LI CLASS="c10"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"><NOBR>&bull;</NOBR></SPAN></P>
<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Analytics approachability for employees. Because data visualization is pretty intuitive, and because it's available for countless applications and departments, it's possible for employees of almost any department to become data analysts in their own right. More data analysts on staff means more analytic power within your organization, and the potential to optimize almost any role for greater productivity and profitability.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
</LI><LI CLASS="c10"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"><NOBR>&bull;</NOBR></SPAN></P>
<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Big data reduction. Until recently, companies have pushed to collect as much data as possible; after all, more data is always better, right? The answer isn't so straightforward. Collecting more data leads to more vulnerability and storage costs, but also more complexity, and more difficulty drawing accurate conclusions. The imminent arrival of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) introduces new privacy considerations. Data visualization takes big data and condenses it to a more intuitive, accessible form, allowing companies to make use of big data while eliminating one of the risks. Hypothetically, that means releasing a core limitation in data advancement within an organization.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
</LI><LI CLASS="c10"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"><NOBR>&bull;</NOBR></SPAN></P>
<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Easing client communication. Effectively demonstrating your results and efforts to clients is one of the toughest challenges for any B2B company. Data visualization eases this problem, giving you an intuitive tool you can use to make almost any concept easier to understand. Visual tools make conversations go smoother and minimize miscommunications.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Future trends to watch</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These benefits are just the start; in the future, data visualization will likely improve even further, especially along these dimensions:</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><UL CLASS="c9"><LI CLASS="c10"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"><NOBR>&bull;</NOBR></SPAN></P>
<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Higher-dimensional data. You can chart two variables against each other with a simple line graph with an X- and Y-axis, with each axis representing a variable. You can chart a third or fourth variable by adding more lines or bars to your chart, or by utilizing some kind of Z-axis. But what if you want to visualize 10 variables or more? High-dimensional data visualization is the answer, but it's a technology still in its infancy. It's hard to make high-dimensional data as intuitive as low-dimensional data, but researchers are striving to find an efficient way to make this happen.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
</LI><LI CLASS="c10"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"><NOBR>&bull;</NOBR></SPAN></P>
<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">VR and AR. The advent of virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) can also change our relationship with data visualizations. Rather than interacting with a static projection on a computer screen, users could feasibly reach out, touch, and interact with data in a 3D environment.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
</LI><LI CLASS="c10"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"><NOBR>&bull;</NOBR></SPAN></P>
<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Machine learning and AI. Already, machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms are making data analytics platforms more intuitive and faster for users. When they become more efficient, they may be able to not only generate custom visualizations, but also recommend what type of visualizations to render based on available data. In effect, they could serve as analysts in and of themselves.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The organizations most willing and able to make good use of data visualization technology are the ones likely to remain competitive for the foreseeable future. If used correctly, this can be more than a superfluous add-on to your existing platforms; it can help you transform your department, or your entire organization for the better.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Each week, Kevin Roose, technology columnist at The New York Times, discusses developments in the tech industry, offering analysis and maybe a joke or two. Kevin is away this week, so Adam Satariano, The Times's European tech correspondent, is stepping in. Want this newsletter in your inbox? Sign up here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hello! All your regular newsletter authors are writing books, taking a week off, or taking a week off when they should be writing books. Instead, you've got me, the newest member of The New York Times tech crew, covering the European tech world based in London. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In what seems like an acceptable form of new-hire hazing, I've been asked to share some of this week's tech news from a perspective 5,000-plus miles from Silicon Valley. Let's get to it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Four-Letter Privacy Law</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Instagram is threatening to block me and many others in Europe out of its app if I don't acknowledge new privacy settings. I had a similar dance with Facebook and Twitter recently. The notices are a result of a European data-privacy law called the General Data Protection Regulation, known as G.D.P.R., going into effect on May 25.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I won't bore you with details. With 11 chapters and 99 subsections, the law's text is a good homeopathic cure for insomnia; it even has many well-paid lawyers confused about how it will be enforced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I'm not convinced that the regulations will do much to change the current tech hierarchy, or that bombarding people with consent requests will change behavior, but I'm eager to see how new transparency rules play out. The law gives European residents stronger rights to see the information a company collects about them -- such as banks, health clubs, retailers or other organizations with personal data -- and to ask that it be deleted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The disclosures will provide an inside look at the dossiers companies compile about us. Privacy groups, seeing an opportunity, are planning to submit data requests on people's behalf and file class-action-style complaints when they spot wrongdoing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As we've seen with the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica scandal, shame can be a more efficient method for changing a company's behavior than any legal proceeding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If you get your data, let me know what you find.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (Unrelated: G.D.P.R. has inspired some wonderful nerd internet, like this playlist.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Taxpayer-Backed Start-Ups</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A long-running sore spot in the European tech scene is the region's lack of large, globally-influential technology companies to match the likes of Alphabet, Uber, Alibaba or Tencent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  European governments have responded by throwing money at the problem. In the past several months, the European Union, France and Britain have announced billions of dollars worth of new financing for venture capital firms and start-ups. A little-known group backed by the European Union, called the European Investment Fund, has for years bankrolled some of the region's top venture capital funds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  People disagree on whether this is a good use of taxpayer money, but to keep up with the United States and China, particularly in areas like artificial intelligence, many European policymakers don't think they have a choice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Cambridge Analytica Shuts Down</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Cambridge Analytica, the political consulting firm that has been embroiled in a data-harvesting scandal, said on Wednesday that it would cease operations and file for bankruptcy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But there was immediately some skepticism about the announcement. My colleagues Nicholas Confessore and Matthew Rosenberg reported that executives at Cambridge Analytica and its affiliate, SCL Group, along with the family of a billionaire Republican financier, Robert Mercer, have moved to set up another British firm called Emerdata. Also involved in the new company is Erik Prince, who founded Blackwater, the private security firm that was renamed Xe Services after Blackwater contractors were convicted of killing Iraqi civilians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Cambridge Analytica said it was being punished for common practices in the online advertising industry. It's a deflection, sure, but also not entirely wrong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Facebook said it began an investigation to find other groups that used data-harvesting tactics similar to those employed by Cambridge Analytica. If Mark Zuckerberg wants to make good on his pledge to be more open and transparent, he'll make the findings public, even if it's not flattering for Facebook.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In Other News</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   The internet collectively chuckled when Zuckerberg put aside Facebook's data-privacy troubles to introduce a dating service at the company's annual developer's conference. The leading online-dating company, Match Group, responded by saying, essentially, ''game on.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Apple showed its gratitude for recent corporate tax cuts in the United States by rewarding its investors with an eye-popping $100 billion buyback and huge dividend increase.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   One of China's largest start-ups, the smartphone and gadget maker Xiaomi, is holding an initial public offering in Hong Kong. Many Chinese start-ups have struggled outside their home market, but Xiaomi said it would use the money to expand internationally, as well as to design new handsets, TVs, home speakers and other households gadgets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Also: Amazon is making dog food. Seriously.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LONDON -- In a couple of weeks, Europe will introduce some of the toughest online privacy rules in the world. The changes are aimed at giving internet users more control over what's collected and shared about them, and they punish companies that don't comply.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's what it means for you. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  What Are the New Rules?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On May 25, a new law called the General Data Protection Regulation goes into effect across the European Union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The law strengthens individual privacy rights and, more important, it has teeth. Companies can be fined up to 4 percent of global revenue -- equivalent to about $1.6 billion for Facebook.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The internet's grand bargain has long been trading privacy for convenience. Businesses offer free services like email, entertainment and search, and in return they collect data and sell advertising.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But recent privacy scandals involving Facebook and the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica highlight the downsides of that trade-off. The system is opaque and ripe for abuse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Europe is attempting to push back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It's too early to know how effective the law will be, but it is being closely watched by governments globally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Will the Internet Look Different?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Not really.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Supporters of the law say it will bring sweeping changes to how companies operate online, but in reality, the effect on your internet experience will be minimal. An American visiting Europe, for example, isn't likely to see a difference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If you live in one of the European Union's 28 member states, there is one change you may welcome -- you are likely to see fewer of those shoe or appliance ads that follow you around the internet after you do some online shopping.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As e-commerce became commonplace, a cottage industry sprang up to track people around the web and nudge them back to online stores to complete a purchase. Advertisers call these ads ''fine tuned,'' but most people consider them creepy, said Johnny Ryan, a researcher at PageFair, an ad-blocking service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Ryan said the new rules would make it harder for ad-targeting companies to collect and sell information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The new law requires companies to be transparent about how your data is handled, and to get your permission before starting to use it. It raises the legal bar that businesses must clear to target ads based on personal information like your relationship status, job or education, or your use of websites and apps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That means online advertising in Europe could become broader, returning to styles more akin to magazines and television, where marketers have a less detailed sense of the audience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  What Are Your Rights?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Even if you don't notice big changes, the new law provides important privacy rights worth knowing about.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For instance, you can ask companies what information they hold about you, and then request that it be deleted. This applies not just to tech companies, but also to banks, retailers, grocery stores or any other organization storing your information. You can even ask your employer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And if you suspect your information is being misused or collected unnecessarily, you can complain to your national data protection regulator, which must investigate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Of course, an individual going up against a giant corporation like Google or Facebook isn't in a fair fight. The law has 11 chapters and 99 sub-articles, and just initiating a case can take as many as 20 steps, according to the International Association of Privacy Professionals, an industry trade group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But the new rules allow people to band together and file class-action style complaints, a legal approach that hasn't been as common in Europe as in the United States. Eager to exploit the new law, privacy groups are planning to file cases on behalf of groups of individuals. The hope is that a few successful lawsuits will have a ripple effect and lead companies to tighten up how they handle personal data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The new law also ensures that you cannot be locked in to any service. Companies must make it possible for you to download your data and move it to a competitor. That could mean moving financial information from one bank to another, or transferring Spotify playlists to a rival streaming service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  What's With All These Privacy Notices?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the weeks before the law goes into force, internet users have been receiving a stream of privacy policy updates in their inboxes -- grocery store loyalty programs, train services, even apps that parents use for youth soccer all have to set out what data they gather from you, and how they handle it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The law requires that the terms and conditions be written in plain, understandable language, not legalese. Companies must also give you options to block information from being gathered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But the deluge of emails is leading to concerns that users are agreeing without taking a closer look.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A similar reaction came after the European Union required companies, starting in 2011, to put warnings on websites alerting users that they were being tracked. The rules have led to so many pop-up disclosure boxes that people often consent just to make the warnings disappear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Companies argue that they are being careful to comply with General Data Protection Regulation, but Giovanni Buttarelli, who oversees an independent European Union agency that advises on privacy-related policies, has been unimpressed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He has criticized the wave of privacy policy emails as being posed in a ''take it or leave it'' manner that leaves users thinking they have to accept the terms in order to keep using a service, rather than letting people choose what information to share.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Buttarelli said the messages may violate the ''spirit'' of the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Will It Make a Difference?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It's too soon to tell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That may be an unsatisfactory answer, but the long-term effects of the new law won't be known for years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Much will depend on how strictly national regulators enforce the rules, and how they use their tight budgets. Data-protection agencies in each European Union country will be in charge of policing the companies that have European headquarters within its borders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That oversight structure is leading to concerns that officials in countries such as Ireland, where Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter and many other data-heavy companies are based, will be overmatched.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A lot of responsibility also falls on you to keep tabs on how companies use your data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The General Data Protection Regulation provides ways to take action if your information is being misused. But the question is whether people care enough, or if trading privacy for convenience remains a worthwhile deal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Preparations are well underway for the royal wedding between Prince Harry and Meghan Markle. But one TV network's plan for the May 19 nuptials is more James Bond than Buckingham Palace.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">British TV network Sky News is unveiling a new &quot;Who's Who Live&quot; app for the royal wedding. It will use facial recognition software to identify guests and give viewers background information about them and their connection to the royal family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The service will be available on Sky's broadcast channel, website and mobile app during the network's six-hour royal wedding special.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sky's artificially intelligent software will utilize&nbsp;Rekognition, a cloud-based machine learning tool from Amazon Web Services that can detect, track and analyze faces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Users will also be able to look back through the video once the arrivals are over to find out about the guest list in detail (or simply indulge their love for the royals again).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A celebrity-spotting AI is less personable than a red carpet reporter. But making tech do the heavy lifting does cut costs, and it also means Sky's staff has to do less research on the royal wedding guest list.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, there are still big questions about the privacy implications of AI surveillance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's unlikely that wedding guests or commoners on the street will know they're being filmed and identified to people all around the world. Observer has reached out to Sky to clarify this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Luckily for Sky, the royal wedding takes place six days before General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) goes into effect. The regulation is meant to ensure data protection and privacy for all residents of the European Union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One key stipulation of GDPR requires companies to get explicit consent from users before processing biometric data (such as facial recognition).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Who's Who Live&quot; isn't Sky's only technological innovation for the impending nuptials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The network will also&nbsp;broadcast the royal wedding in 4K (which has four times the picture quality of regular HD). Sky will utilize 160 technical staff, 51 cameras and 17 miles of cable during its coverage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The actual ceremony will mark the end of a long royal wedding blitz for Sky. The network will be broadcasting from the royal residence at Windsor Castle for a week before the wedding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But while the British media is using the latest tech to report and spy on wedding guests, the guests themselves will have to surrender their electronics. Cell phones and cameras are banned from both the ceremony and reception.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So anyone looking for the perfect palace Instagram will be royally screwed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On May 25, the data protection laws in Europe will undergo their most significant changes in the past 20 years. In recent years, companies both foreign and domestic have been adjusting their business practices to be in compliance with the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation. The GDPR will replace the European Commission's Data Protection Directive passed in 1995, officially called Directive 95/46/EC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new regulation will hold companies accountable when it comes to their collection and use of European citizens' personal data. It will prescribe a standardized law for data protection across all EU member states, differing from the Data Protection Directive, which required member states to transpose the requirements of the Directive into national law, resulting in similar but different data protection standards and levels of enforcement across the EU.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the United States, there is no single comprehensive data protection law. They have sectoral data protection laws that regulate certain types of data and certain uses of data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, the United States has the Fair Credit Reporting Act that regulates information related to credit, insurance and employment; the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, which regulates the use of protected health information; the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, which regulates the electronic transmission of health information; the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act, which regulates the use of email addresses&nbsp; for email marketing and the Children's Online Privacy Protection Rule, which regulates the use of children's information and others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Additionally, the Federal Trade Commission regulates privacy and data collection through Section 5 of the FTC Act, which &quot;prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A key distinction between the EU and U.S. legislation is the type of data that is protected as &quot;personal&quot; under each data protection regime. Personal information is anything that can be used to identify the user directly such as a phone number or social security or indirectly, via cookie ID or device ID.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the EU, personal data is protected just because it is personal data regardless of the use. The GDPR requires that an entity must first have a lawful basis, or reason, to collect personal data before doing so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the context of data collection online, that lawful basis is often consent, meaning that an EU consumer must opt-in to having their personal data collected online.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section 5 of the FTC Act requires that an entity provide consumers with notice about the type of data they are collecting and what they are using it for, with an opportunity to opt-out. There is no requirement, however, that a consumer opt-in, unless the collection falls under a specific sectoral law or the data being collected is deemed sensitive data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This begs the question as to what a U.S. citizen should expect of privacy when compared with an EU citizen come May 25. On one hand, action is required to release personal data in the EU.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the other, in the United States action is required to keep that data private. This fundamental difference in the way data is collected suggests that Americans have a higher tolerance when it comes to volunteering personal data in order to use the tools and platforms on the internet that are available to them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With Mark Zuckerberg's recent appearance in front of the Senate Commerce and Judiciary committees, and the questioning that followed, it is all too apparent that the rules are not nearly as cut and dry as one would think. Maybe it is time that the United States adopt some policy directives from the EU.</SPAN></P>

Kevin is away this week, so Adam Satariano, The Times's European tech correspondent, is stepping in. Want this newsletter in your inbox? Sign up here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hello! All your regular newsletter authors are writing books, taking a week off, or taking a week off when they should be writing books. Instead, you've got me, the newest member of The New York Times tech crew, covering the European tech world based in London. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In what seems like an acceptable form of new-hire hazing, I've been asked to share some of this week's tech news from a perspective 5,000-plus miles from Silicon Valley. Let's get to it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Four-Letter Privacy Law</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Instagram is threatening to block me and many others in Europe out of its app if I don't acknowledge new privacy settings. I had a similar dance with Facebook and Twitter recently. The notices are a result of a European data-privacy law called the General Data Protection Regulation, known as G.D.P.R., going into effect on May 25.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I won't bore you with details. With 11 chapters and 99 subsections, the law's text is a good homeopathic cure for insomnia; it even has many well-paid lawyers confused about how it will be enforced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I'm not convinced that the regulations will do much to change the current tech hierarchy, or that bombarding people with consent requests will change behavior, but I'm eager to see how new transparency rules play out. The law gives European residents stronger rights to see the information a company collects about them -- such as banks, health clubs, retailers or other organizations with personal data -- and to ask that it be deleted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The disclosures will provide an inside look at the dossiers companies compile about us. Privacy groups, seeing an opportunity, are planning to submit data requests on people's behalf and file class-action-style complaints when they spot wrongdoing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As we've seen with the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica scandal, shame can be a more efficient method for changing a company's behavior than any legal proceeding.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Taxpayer-Backed Start-Ups</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A long-running sore spot in the European tech scene is the region's lack of large, globally-influential technology companies to match the likes of Alphabet, Uber, Alibaba or Tencent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  European governments have responded by throwing money at the problem. In the past several months, the European Union, France and Britain have announced billions of dollars worth of new financing for venture capital firms and start-ups. A little-known group backed by the European Union, called the European Investment Fund, has for years bankrolled some of the region's top venture capital funds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  People disagree on whether this is a good use of taxpayer money, but to keep up with the United States and China, particularly in areas like artificial intelligence, many European policymakers don't think they have a choice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Cambridge Analytica Shuts Down</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Cambridge Analytica, the political consulting firm that has been embroiled in a data-harvesting scandal, said on Wednesday that it would cease operations and file for bankruptcy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But there was immediately some skepticism about the announcement. My colleagues Nicholas Confessore and Matthew Rosenberg reported that executives at Cambridge Analytica and its affiliate, SCL Group, along with the family of a billionaire Republican financier, Robert Mercer, have moved to set up another British firm called Emerdata. Also involved in the new company is Erik Prince, who founded Blackwater, the private security firm that was renamed Xe Services after Blackwater contractors were convicted of killing Iraqi civilians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Cambridge Analytica said it was being punished for common practices in the online advertising industry. It's a deflection, sure, but also not entirely wrong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Facebook said it began an investigation to find other groups that used data-harvesting tactics similar to those employed by Cambridge Analytica. If Mark Zuckerberg wants to make good on his pledge to be more open and transparent, he'll make the findings public, even if it's not flattering for Facebook.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In Other News</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   The internet collectively chuckled when Zuckerberg put aside Facebook's data-privacy troubles to introduce a dating service at the company's annual developer's conference. The leading online-dating company, Match Group, responded by saying, essentially, ''game on.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Apple showed its gratitude for recent corporate tax cuts in the United States by rewarding its investors with an eye-popping $100 billion buyback and huge dividend increase.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   One of China's largest start-ups, the smartphone and gadget maker Xiaomi, is holding an initial public offering in Hong Kong. Many Chinese start-ups have struggled outside their home market, but Xiaomi said it would use the money to expand internationally, as well as to design new handsets, TVs, home speakers and other households gadgets.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1064  words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Click for image</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When BJ's Wholesale Club on Thursday (May 3) said that it would leverage artificial intelligence machine learning in its mobile app, it joined the crowded club of companies boasting machine-learning capabilities while remaining vague on the details.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the 215-store chain - operating in Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, South Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Virginia - pledged to use machine learning to boost its CRM shopper profiles and to immediately apply it to change mobile responses.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The new discover feature lets shoppers explore new products and easily swipe right to add to a wishlist or left to dismiss a product,&quot; the chain said in one of the shortest news releases that retail has ever seen. &quot;Using machine learning, the discover experience will be personalized to each user based on previous selections they've made through the swipe right or left process.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why do I find this so interesting? Because mobile retail has been impressively remiss in this area for far too long. Given the very nature of mobile interactions, shoppers share far more clues about likes and dislikes than they do with desktop interactions. A desktop interaction with a web page can capture completed actions (making a purchase, putting something in a cart and then removing it, clicking on a product page for more details, etc.), but mobile can track far more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aside from the swiping right and left that BJ touched on - which clearly adds actionable data to the shopper's profile - there is the geolocation data specifying where the shopper is at the moment of the interaction. The system can track a daily commute and note, for example, that this shopper will often look at product pages on the train on the way home, will never look at all on the way in and will only complete purchases while at home. That would suggest that a pop-up offer to close a deal (say an extra 15% off for buying right now) is wasted when the shopper is on the train, but an excellent approach when at home. The app (like its desktop counterpart) also knows the times when this shopper is more likely to be open to closing a purchase.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another key area that retailers need to explore is the age-old single view of the customer. In this instance, that means being aware when the customer moves from the mobile device to a desktop and then potentially inside a store. Is this shopper inclined to research on a mobile device and then purchase on a desktop? Does the&nbsp;shopper explore on the mobile device and then drive to your store? That can be tracked quite precisely, with the mobile geolocation data indicating that the&nbsp;shopper is approaching a store and then the store's Wi-Fi connection confirming it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Or is this shopper comfortable with tendering a purchase on a mobile device? If so, is the&nbsp;shopper using a password-memorizing app? Passwords are often the key obstacle with mobile purchase completions. That said, biometric login on an app (fingerprint or facial recognition typically) can make a big difference with making shoppers comfortable closing the deal on mobile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let's drill down a bit into this swiping business. BJ's statement said it will be a right swipe for a shopper to add an item to a wishlist and a left swipe to dismiss a product. What new data is this likely to deliver? The right-swipe effort won't yield anything new, since shoppers already had a way (shopping cart or wishlist) to note what they wanted to pursue. It's the left-swipe action that is potentially new data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unfortunately, this raises the key question: Why would a shopper bother? Let's say that a customer is interested in a new air conditioner. She'll likely scroll through all of the AC options until she finds one she likes and then act on that one. Why would she bother swiping left on something she doesn't care about?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This looks like a Tinder setup. But who among BJ's customers would spend their time saying, 'I like this and I don't like this product?'&quot; asked retail technology consultant Todd Michaud. &quot;What problem for the customer is this solving? What about this is worthwhile for the customer to do? And without this providing benefits to the consumer, why on earth would they do this?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another consideration: This binary choice - like/dislike, right/left swipe - is not especially meaningful, Michaud said. Most products will be irrelevant, which is very different from being one the shopper doesn't like. Consider, for example, a person who has no babies being offered a steep discount on diapers. Her accurate answer may be that she has no interest because she has no need. Forcing her to swipe left to indicate dislike will do little other than give your team misleading data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michaud added that there is a reason for the chain to want this. That involves the tendency of people to be more truthful when listing dislikes than listing likes. To be polite, someone might say they like something that they really don't care about. But saying &quot;dislike&quot; often indicates a stronger sentiment. &quot;So I get it in concept, but, again, why would customers do it?&quot; he asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's something else to consider and it involves machine learning and every IT person's least-favorite subject this month: the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) set to go into effect later this month. There is a GDPR provision about automated decision-making that says that &quot;the data subject [consumer] shall have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects concerning him or her or similarly significantly affects him or her.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Does &quot;significantly affect him or her&quot; include offers and special discounts? If so, does this mean that BJ's will need to get special permission from each mobile shopper before doing this with each one?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On BJ's swiping and machine-learning effort, here's my take: The swiping is a smokescreen when it comes to&nbsp;machine learning. BJ's will undoubtedly use machine learning to analyze everything it can dealing with mobile's attributes, in-store's attributes and desktop interaction attributes. But there's simply not likely to be enough new data from this swiping effort to make a difference. Hence, it wanted to tout the consumer-oriented swipe effort while somehow mentioning&nbsp;machine learning.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Upcoming European privacy rules, called GDPR, have brought a barrage of emails as tech companies everywhere try to comply. Here's what experts say about what you should pay attention to.<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By now, you may have received several emails from tech and other companies that are updating their terms of service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You can thank new European data privacy rules for the unplanned party in your inbox. Companies are rolling out new TOS as they try to comply with stricter regulations on companies handling of user data and privacy. The rules are called General Data Protection Regulation&nbsp;(GDPR), and theyre set to take effect May 25.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you walked up to the average person on the street in the U.S. and ask them about GDPR, theyd probably say is that a hockey team?  said&nbsp;Albert Gidari, director of privacy at the Center for Internet &amp; Society at Stanford Law School, on Thursday. Gidari said many people dont seem too concerned about privacy issues.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I think people believe the benefits (of technology) outweigh the risk to their privacy, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Should people be resigned to risking their privacy and security so they can turn to their smartphones for almost anything they need, and in most cases for free?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are already noises suggesting that if you object to being tracked in exchange for the free services on which many of which our lives now depend, then the only alternative is to pay, said&nbsp;Giovanni Buttarelli, European data protection supervisor, in a blog post this week. But the fundamental right to privacy and related freedoms like free speech and non-discrimination apply to all, they cannot be the exclusive privilege of&nbsp;those who can afford to pay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Get tech news in your inbox weekday mornings. Sign up  for the free Good Morning Silicon Valley newsletter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The people who do care about privacy might have at least opened some of the recent emails. Twitters email, for example, the company says it has updated its terms of service and its privacy policy, and that we encourage you to read both documents in full.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Theres an option to download a PDF of the privacy policy  a cool 12 pages. The new TOS? No PDF option, but imagine lots of scrolling to get through the whole thing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I did a comparison between Twitter policy before and after the revision, and its a total tangled mess, said Jake Snow, Technology &amp; Civil Liberties attorney at ACLU of Northern California, this week. Its not easy to pull out the crucial information users need to know, he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Snow thinks some people do care (about privacy), and that theres additional attention to issue now partly because of Cambridge Analytica.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Danny OBrien, international director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, in an interview this week offered up these main points users will want to look for amid the email flood:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Users should get a clearer picture of what data is being collected and what its being used for: You cant ask people to upload their photos, and then suddenly use that data for facial recognition, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Users should be able to delete information or make changes more easily.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Data portability: You should be able to see everything they have, download it and take it elsewhere, OBrien said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Users might be asked to reaffirm their consent: Theres a risk of people saying stop asking me, just do what you want, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But after the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica privacy mess  which involved the accessing of data of tens of millions of users without their permission, and for purposes that werent clear to those users  it probably is worth checking out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OBrien also issued a couple of warnings. The deluge of changes is just the beginning as companies try to get GDPR compliance right, he said. And if discussions on&nbsp;Reddit are any indication, some smaller companies will probably decide complying with stricter data privacy and collection regulations isnt worth it.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Bloomberg) -- The disingenuous way companies are attempting to comply with the letter, not the spirit, of the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation is only part of the problem with the new privacy rule, which goes into effect May 25. For publishers already forced to accept Google's near monopoly on programmatic advertising on their sites, the new regulation could make things worse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Google has altered its ad policies to comply with the GDPR. The changes affect all businesses running its ad modules or using the U.S. company's programmatic advertising tools offered under the DoubleClick umbrella brand, which is the biggest digital advertising platform.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most publishers sell their inventory through Google, and many derive a majority of their revenue from Google-run services. Now, Google has told them it intends to act as controller of any personal data provided by the publishers under the GDPR. That means the internet giant will need publishers to obtain consent from readers or subscribers for its use of the data. The publishers will essentially have no say about how Google uses the data they hand over. The important thing is that if they fail to obtain consent, Google won't serve ads on their sites.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GDPR defines a data controller as an entity that decides how and for what purpose data will be processed; it can use &quot;data processors&quot; to do it on its behalf. For example, a publisher that has collected a detailed subscriber database and now wants to target ads to the subscribers is a data controller, and the provider of the targeted advertising solution is the processor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's not how Google wants to play it: It intends to control the data. This creates a trust problem for publishers. They aim to build close, sometimes emotional relationships with readers, listeners and viewers. But under Google's terms, they'll have to tell these customers explicitly that their data will be handed over to a third party, Google, without specifying what Google will do with it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is what happened before the GDPR, too: Publishers' and advertisers' troves of information about their customers have always been a major source for Google, Facebook and other data harvesters. But the customers weren't told about it so clearly, or asked so explicitly if it was acceptable to them. Now, Google is essentially demanding a coming out about these practices. Given the indignation of media about privacy in recent months, this will look more than a little hypocritical.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several publishers' associations, which between them represent many of the biggest media companies with operations in Europe, have sent a letter to Google Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai that lays out publishers' objections to this arrangement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Claiming such broad rights over all data in the ecosystem, without full disclosure and without providing publishers the option for Google to act as a processor for certain types of data, appears to be an intentional abuse of your market power,&quot; the letter says. &quot;At the same time, you refuse to provide publishers with any specific information about how you will collect, share and use the data. Placing the full burden of obtaining new consent on the publisher is untenable without providing the publisher with the specific information needed to provide sufficient transparency or to obtain the requisite specific, granular, and informed consent under the GDPR.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Google, for its part, maintains that any data a publisher or advertiser provides to its marketing tools are isolated and only used to target ads for the particular client. But that doesn't make it easier for a publisher to sell a reader on the idea of giving private information to Google, the giant information vacuum cleaner, not to her favorite news site.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The search company has promised to &quot;offer a solution to support publishers that want to show non-personalized ads,&quot; but that solution hasn't been presented yet. In their letter, the publishers ask Pichai to explain how it will work and whether it will allow them to run Google-served ads without obtaining consent from users.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a way, the drafters of the GDPR deserve kudos for creating this controversy. Many internet users have given little thought to how exactly their data get harvested without their explicit consent. Now, they'll see that even when they give information to their favorite publication (or a store they frequent, or pretty much any other organization), there is a strong likelihood it will end up with Google and Facebook.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That, however, doesn't make things easier for publishers, which have come to depend on Google for advertising revenues just like many ordinary users have accepted Google's search monopoly. There aren't many places for them to go unless they help Google comply with the GDPR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Non-targeted advertising - yes, the kind we saw in the old days, when printed newspapers and free-to-air TV were our top news sources - is the honest solution: It could reassure readers that, to the news providers, they are valued customers, not a product to be bought and sold. But would advertisers go for it or would it mean the loss of even more advertising revenue for publishers? Advertisers are already used to the promise of targeting, even if they can't be sure it works as well as Google and Facebook claim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The entire ecosystem - the big data harvesters, the advertisers, the content producers - is complicit in the current privacy-destroying business model. Different models, from ad-free subscription-based options to ones that pay people to see ads, exist, but they would have to be much more broadly accepted to make them industry standards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the end, the responsibility lies with us, the readers, the customers.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you walked up to the average person on the street in the U.S. and ask them about GDPR, theyd probably say is that a hockey team?  said&nbsp;Albert Gidari, director of privacy at the Center for Internet &amp; Society at Stanford Law School, on Thursday. Gidari said many people dont seem too concerned about privacy issues.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I think people believe the benefits (of technology) outweigh the risk to their privacy, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Should people be resigned to risking their privacy and security so they can turn to their smartphones for almost anything they need, and in most cases for free?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are already noises suggesting that if you object to being tracked in exchange for the free services on which many of which our lives now depend, then the only alternative is to pay, said&nbsp;Giovanni Buttarelli, European data protection supervisor, in a blog post this week. But the fundamental right to privacy and related freedoms like free speech and non-discrimination apply to all, they cannot be the exclusive privilege of&nbsp;those who can afford to pay.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The people who do care about privacy might have at least opened some of the recent emails. Twitters email, for example, the company says it has updated its terms of service and its privacy policy, and that we encourage you to read both documents in full.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Theres an option to download a PDF of the privacy policy  a cool 12 pages. The new TOS? No PDF option, but imagine lots of scrolling to get through the whole thing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I did a comparison between Twitter policy before and after the revision, and its a total tangled mess, said Jake Snow, Technology &amp; Civil Liberties attorney at ACLU of Northern California, this week. Its not easy to pull out the crucial information users need to know, he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Snow thinks some people do care (about privacy), and that theres additional attention to issue now partly because of Cambridge Analytica.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Danny OBrien, international director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, in an interview this week offered up these main points users will want to look for amid the email flood:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Users should get a clearer picture of what data is being collected and what its being used for: You cant ask people to upload their photos, and then suddenly use that data for facial recognition, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Users should be able to delete information or make changes more easily.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Data portability: You should be able to see everything they have, download it and take it elsewhere, OBrien said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Users might be asked to reaffirm their consent: Theres a risk of people saying stop asking me, just do what you want, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But after the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica privacy mess  which involved the accessing of data of tens of millions of users without their permission, and for purposes that werent clear to those users  it probably is worth checking out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">        Facebook moving most users from protection of EU privacy law     </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">        Google privacy settlement gets scrutiny from U.S. Supreme Court     </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">        California privacy measures backers submit signatures      </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OBrien also issued a couple of warnings. The deluge of changes is just the beginning as companies try to get GDPR compliance right, he said. And if discussions on&nbsp;Reddit are any indication, some smaller companies will probably decide complying with stricter data privacy and collection regulations isnt worth it.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It took a while to dig through all the announcements, but I've come up with a list of significant patches to Windows and Office released in April (ignoring the previews). Here's what I found:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">April 3 - Non-security Office patches. Numerous bugs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">April 3 &nbsp;- A&nbsp;security hole warning about the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine. Get the new version of the scanning engine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">April 4 - Re-issued buggy March Win7 patches KB 4088877 and 4088878,&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">April 10 - A&nbsp;Servicing Stack update for Win10 1709.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">April 11 - The description of the Win7 Monthly Rollup KB 4093118 changed to say you need to install the KB 4099950 Carnak patch before installing 4093118. Confusion multiplies exponentially.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">April 12 - Report that the Win10 version 1709 cumulative update contains a bug that messes up the pen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">April 12 - A re-released Win7 Monthly Rollup KB 4093118 (metadata changed).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">April 17 - Second set of Cumulative Updates this month for Win10 version 1607 and 1703</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">April 18 - Reports that the Win7 Monthly Rollup KB 4093118 is installing itself over and over again. We subsequently found that odd behavior was triggered by the Win7 Monthly Rollup Preview.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">April 30 - Win10 version 1803 released, as was .NET Framework 4.7.2.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Did I miss any?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Susan Bradley says:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Microsoft... with all the new emphasis on privacy and data collection in 1803, with all the push on GDPR,&nbsp;&nbsp;please start by rebuilding the trust of Windows Updates. &nbsp;Start with going back to consistent days. Start by going back to specific days of release.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Patching. Microsoft's least-understood billion-dollar business.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The research firm, which conducted its study on behalf of Veridium, a provider of authentication technology, surveyed 200 U.S. senior IT decision-makers, and nearly two-thirds (63 percent) of those whose organizations had experienced a data breach said they are using or planning to use biometric authentication to prevent other attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A majority of the survey respondents, or 81 percent, believed biometric authentication secures their organizations' data better than the use of passwords alone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The study found that organizations continue to be targets for attackers, with more than half, or 53 percent, of the respondents saying their organization had experienced a data breach within the last five years.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The impending deadline for the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which is designed to provide data privacy for European Union EU citizens, is a top consideration in security strategies, with 89 percent of the respondents saying the deadline is affecting how they manage and secure EU citizens' data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nearly all of the respondents, or 99 percent, said their organizations are using passwords for secure access, yet only 34 percent are &quot;very confident&quot; that passwords alone can provide enough data protection.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">May 03--When the May 25 enforcement deadline for Europe's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) rolls around, U.S. companies, organizations and institutions that target their products and services to people living in Europe will be on the hook to comply or potentially face steep fines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GDPR is a set of strict rules that give European Union (EU) citizens control over their personally identifiable information (PII).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rules have instilled fear in a number of these entities, which may face fines of up to 4 percent of their annual global revenue or 20 million euros, whichever is greater, should they fail GDPR compliance. But what about state and local governments?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regulators explain GDPR's impact on government</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If a third country processor like a U.S. government agency is not targeting the European market with goods and services, then they would not have to abide by GDPR,&quot; said Dirk Hensel, a spokesman for Germany's federal commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information. &quot;I don't think we'll see too many of these cases are relevant.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, a resident in Germany may own property in Los Angeles County and pay the fee to access their records online through the county's website. In this particular case, Los Angeles County is not &quot;targeting&quot; Germany's residents or other European citizens to use the service. It just happens to have a website that can be accessed by German citizens and others throughout the globe, he noted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, if the state of Florida's tourism department, for example, launches a promotional campaign to target residents living in Europe to come visit the Sunshine State, then any PII data collected on those German citizens by the state of Florida would likely fall under GDPR requirements, he explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One point Hensel noted, however, is if the Florida tourism department relied on an advertising agency to run its promotional campaign and interact with Germany's citizens, then it is the advertising agency that needs to abide by GDPR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anya Burgess, a spokeswoman with the United Kingdom's Information Commissioner's Office, told Government Technology that GDPR only applies if individuals who receive the product or service reside in Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result, GDPR does not apply if a U.S. government agency collects PII data on a citizen of Europe who is visiting or living in the U.S. and uses that government agency's services or products while in the U.S.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If the processing is not going on in the EU to citizens in the EU, then it doesn't apply,&quot; Burgess said, noting, &quot;U.S. government agencies provide their services in the U.S. and not the EU and would not be regulated by the GDPR.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State and local government agencies are encouraged to contact EU data authorities if they have GDPR questions, Hensel advised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GDPR defined</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under GDPR, all companies, institutions, organizations and government agencies that process PII on individuals residing in the European Union must abide by these privacy regulations, regardless of where the entity is located.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Overall, the goal of GDPR is to provide European residents with transparency of how their PII data is used, improve the level of control over their own data and increase the safeguards used to protect that data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GDPR requires entities to request PII data in clear, simple language and attach the consent form to the information on why the data is needed. And before a government agency or other entities can use the PII data, users would need to opt in with their consent and be able to withdraw that consent just as easily, according to the GDPR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holding EU citizen data not an option</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the impact on state and local governments is expected to be minimal, government agencies are still taking stock of where they potentially stand when it comes to complying with GDPR and safeguarding PII data of EU citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Washington state Office of Privacy and Data Protection (OPDP) held a staff meeting in March to discuss GDPR issues, according to Will Saunders, senior program manager for open data at Washington's OPDP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alex Alben, Washington state chief privacy officer, led the discussion on how much risk Washington state faces under GDPR and one of the issues considered, for example, is the number of Europeans who receive services from the state and what potential risks that could mean to Washington state, Saunders recalled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The number of Europeans receiving state services is pretty minimal and the state is already taking efforts to keep its PII to a minimum,&quot; said Saunders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GDPR consultant Sheila FitzPatrick, founder of FitzPatrick &amp; Associates, said state and local governments will not likely have a lot of PII data on European residents, compared to federal agencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Governments tend to hold onto data, but under GDPR, in most circumstances, they won't be able to do that,&quot; she warned. &quot;Federal, state and local governments are not exempt under GDPR.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the data of 87 million Facebook users was compromised by Cambridge Analytica, the future of online privacy and who has the responsibility to regulate and protect it is in question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While legislation at the federal level may prevent or at least protect consumers from future breaches of privacy, what can be done at the state level is much more limited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State Rep. Jimmy Anderson, D-Fitchburg, said he has not heard of any proposed legislation at the state level.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Doing this kind of legislation at the state level is hard because of interstate commerce and First Amendment issues,&quot; Anderson said. &quot;If something is deemed as interstate commerce, as Facebook likely is, it is up to the federal government to regulate it. First Amendment issues, also, because this has to do with speech, and if you are regulating speech, any regulations come across at the federal level.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rep. Chris Taylor, D-Madison, said she is also watching to see what happens at the federal level, specifically, legislation proposed by Senators Amy Klobuchar, D-MN, and John Kennedy, R-LA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a press release issued April 12, the two senators announced they would introduce legislation that would protect the privacy of consumers' online data by improving transparency, strengthening consumers' recourse options when a breach of data occurs, and ensuring companies are compliant with privacy policies that protect consumers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State legislators unanimously vote to protect internet privacy in WisconsinAs internet privacy remains a hot-button issue around the world, the Wisconsin state Senate unanimously&nbsp;passed a recent amendment April 4&nbsp;aimed Read...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More specifically, the proposed legislation will give consumers the right to opt-out and keep their information private by disabling data tracking and collection. It also proposes to provide users greater access to and control of their data, require terms and service agreements to be in plain language and mandate that users be notified of a breach of their information within 72 hours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Consumers have the right to know if their personal information is being sold and they have the right to easily see what data has already been sold or distributed,&quot;&nbsp;Klobuchar said. &quot;Most importantly, consumers should have the right to keep their information private, be alerted when a data breach has occurred, and be informed of the remedies available to them when their personal information is compromised.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his hearing on April 10 and 11, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg said he was not opposed to legal regulation of the platform and said he would support&nbsp;legislation like that proposed by Senators Klobuchar and Kennedy. Other ways of regulating Facebook have been suggested, including extending the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation worldwide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As reported by the Guardian, companies under the GDPR are required to protect the personal data and privacy of all residents of European Union countries. But while Zuckerberg said Facebook intends to make GDPR settings available everywhere, there is speculation, as reported by The Verge, as to whether this will actually take effect for all users May 25.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nonetheless, Taylor said she was &quot;heartened&quot; to hear Facebook intends to comply with European Union law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think we are going to see some changes,&quot; Taylor said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Supreme Court hears oral arguments in academic freedom, free speech caseThe Wisconsin Supreme Court heard cases from both sides of the conflict in the McAdams v. Marquette hearing on Thursday Read...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the Associated Press, all Facebook users who may have had their data shared with Cambridge Analytica were notified beginning April 9. All Facebook users, regardless of their data status, were provided a link on their feeds that informed them of what apps they have used and what information they have shared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another option could be regulating Facebook as an &quot;information fiduciary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Facebook would essentially have to be the fiduciary for your data and information, and act in your best interest,&quot; Anderson said. &quot;Facebook would be held accountable if they did not, which would prevent them from going behind your back. Establishing this would make sure Facebook is held accountable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the meantime, however, a few simple changes made to users' privacy settings can be made,&nbsp;University of Wisconsin associate professor in the School of Journalism &amp; Mass Communication Christopher Wells said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wells suggested downloading the data Facebook has collected about you and what companies are targeting you through the platform.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All companies are scraping up data to create profiles for people,&quot; Wells said. &quot;That is not escapable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gerrymandering gives way to lack of bipartisan legislation, Whitford saysThe League of Women Voters of Dane County hosted University of Wisconsin law professor William Whitford Wednesday evening to discuss Read...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anderson advocated for reading the terms and service, noting the importance of knowing the different controls available to users.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While disabling or enabling certain privacy settings may seem easy enough, Taylor believes there should be a clear and explicit option to &quot;opt-in and opt-out&quot; when sharing personal data on Facebook. Even facial recognition technology, used when tagging friends in photos, is a way of sharing personal information Taylor said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is a lot we can do, and of course we don't want to curtail innovation and creativity,&quot; Taylor said. &quot;But at least make it easy to understand what is going to be shared and what isn't.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is now only three weeks until the EU's General Data Protection Regulation will take effect, and many organizations are scrambling down to the wire in order to meet the new data privacy mandate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The stakes are high. Failure to comply can invite a fine of up to four percent of global annual revenues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Companies familiar with the EU privacy directive will notice that the GDPR expands and adds specificity to the directive's privacy protections. Those not familiar with the EU directive may find it more challenging to put the concepts into practice. And since there is no official pre-set certification for GDPR compliance, it's wise to avoid costly mistakes by adhering to, or at least acknowledging, some best-practice advice.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A potentially huge mistake is to regard GDPR compliance as a one-time event rather than an ongoing process. It is not like SOC or ISO certification. Since there is no specific certification, compliance is based largely on certain &quot;appropriateness&quot; standards and it's up to each organization to determine what that means.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is more of an evolutionary process, and, like many aspects of your legal landscape, meanings and definitions may change as case law evolves. That is why, to avoid a third mistake, it is important to use legal counsel, either in-house or external, who has experience with EU data privacy laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Legal counsel can help in several ways. You may want to ask for a legal opinion on the state of your GDPR compliance, for instance. This would not be binding, but may help if your GDPR compliance is called into question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also, in GDPR parlance you will be considered either a data controller or a data processor, depending on your role within the GDPR framework.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A data controller, or DC, is the person or organization that determines the purposes or the means of the processing of personal data; a data processor, or DP, is the person or organization that processes the personal data on behalf of the DC. As with Logtrust, some organizations may fill both roles, with respect to different data sets or different purposes for which data is processed. You can find greater GDPR detail at sites such asthis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to offering general guidance, experienced legal counsel will be helpful in writing your required data processing agreements. The contract itself is very much standardized and resembles a BAA, or business associate agreement under HIPAA, but as with all contracts it will benefit from legal oversight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GDPR is for SMBs too</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some organizations may assume GDPR is meant only for large multinationals. It's not. Any company that stores and processes data in products or services will be affected if those products or services may end up in EU-related hands or process data of European data subjects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Likewise, collecting data from European data subjects for lead generation or other marketing purposes may put you in view of GDPR oversight. And if you have an employee in an office in France, Germany, or other EU country, you're subject to the GDPR's regulations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(The UK is still considered an EU member state, including for purposes of the GDPR, and is looking to its newly passed version of the Data Protection Act to stay in compliance. There will be some differences, however.Hereis an overview of the new Data Protection Act.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Know your data</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GDPR allows just 72 hours for notification of a data breach to the supervisory authorities. The notification has certain formal requirements and includes detailed disclosures. Affected data subjects also have to be notified without undue delay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Think about this short period when you suddenly discover some data has been hacked, and you have to find out how and why and to what extent. Imagine your teams scrambling around to find answers in such a high-stress situation. That is why, in addition to clearly written policy, you should train staff in advance so they are ready to respond. In addition, you should employ reliable tools and mechanisms that can rapidly provide clear visibility and accessibility into your data. Time is of the essence in such a situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Company-wide communication is key</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GDPR compliance should be viewed as an ongoing process, and so should the process of communicating its requirements and likely impact to people throughout the organization. You should hold periodic meetings with IT and legal staff to discuss changes in the regulations and to answer any questions about GDPR implementation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GDPR may also affect an organization's HR function if it has employees in the EU. The personal data of European employees is subject to protection under GDPR. You should therefore also take care in addressing employees to make sure they understand how GDPR represents a substantial improvement in safeguarding their privacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protecting employees is, after all, a key objective, so written communications should be clear and uncluttered, and should not come across as just another edict from management. Even better, hold regular employee meetings, quarterly, perhaps, to discuss concerns, questions, and any changes in compliance policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, communication should also travel upward to executives and a company's board of directors. Compliance is an important part of their responsibilities. In fact, GDPR compliance should be an integral part of any company's data privacy and security program, which fits within the larger context of risk management.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today's best-run companies have recognized that and have made a top-level risk-management program an essential piece of their company strategy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Bonazzo</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">567 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook and Google are introducing a new breed of addicts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That was the sobering conclusion to a discussion about &quot;how tech has us hooked&quot; at the Collision conference in New Orleans this morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tristan Harris, co-founder of the&nbsp;Center for Humane Technology, started things off by noting that humans have reached an inflection point in our relationship with technology. His group is working to reverse the &quot;digital attention crisis&quot; among tech users.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Technology is the largest invisible cultural and political actor in the world,&quot; Harris said. &quot;This is not just a neutral tool, there are 1,000 engineers on the other side of the screen.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Common Sense Media&nbsp;founder and CEO Jim Steyer agreed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You need to think about the values, health and well-being of the kids and families in your audience,&quot; he told the assembled tech industry honchos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This line and many others during the discussion elicited both applause and shaking heads in the auditorium. But the duo continued holding tech's feet to the fire and urged developers to consider the reach of their products.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harris pointed out that social networks that boast a billion or more users (such as Facebook or YouTube) have more &quot;followers&quot; than many major world religions. And these companies make design choices which ensure the faithful will keep coming back for more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tech controls me from the time I wake up with my phone alarm to when I go to bed and set my alarm for the next morning,&quot; Harris said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He compared the device to a slot machine offering new treasures-but in this case, the bounty is tweets, emails and new notifications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is especially worrisome when it comes to children using tech. Kids' brains aren't fully developed until age 25, so introducing technology when a child is two or three can have profoundly negative effects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arguments about &quot;kids these days&quot; may seem trite, but Harris said the discussion is different now that the prevailing technology is more than just television or radio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You're completely immersed in an intimate relationship with your phone,&quot; he said</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This can even impact social relationships, as kids (and adults) begin living their lives through a screen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You can project on your eyeball photo after photo of your friends having fun without you,&quot; Harris said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As such, Harris and Steyer have collaborated on the Truth About Tech campaign, which has four main goals:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Educating the public.Holding the tech industry accountable because &quot;they intentionally designed it this way,&quot; Steyer said.Teaching kids about the ways in which they're being manipulated.Introducing comprehensive privacy legislation similar to GDPR in Europe. &quot;Why should the kids of the United States have worse privacy protections than kids in Europe do?&quot; Steyer asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harris piggybacked off this point by comparing companies like Facebook, Apple and Google to urban planners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They screwed up, and now they need better zoning laws,&quot; he said. &quot;This is a threat to everybody.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All is not lost, however. In fact, Steyer is optimistic-as long as the tech community does what it's supposed to do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You can design stuff that has incredible positive impact for society and makes you rich, but you can do it with an ethical code,&quot; he said. &quot;That conversation doesn't happen on a phone, it happens sitting with people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But until this change occurs, what's the best thing consumers can do to become less dependent on their phones?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Put them away,&quot; Steyer said.</SPAN></P>

This means that your career is literally on the line. As a result, your storage architecture better be up to the task of maintaining the integrity of your data store.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hybrid-cloud architectures provide one of the most secure means&nbsp;of protecting stored data</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The good news is that the hybrid-cloud storage architecture we've been examining in this column is one of the best potential solutions for small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to leverage when security is of paramount importance. It delivers a secure, end-to-end architecture that provides the flexibility of the cloud with the performance of an on-premises solution, while still encrypting data flows from one site to the other.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You might well ask the question - Why can't a data center be made as secure and fault-tolerant as the cloud? The answer is clearly it can, however this is very costly, and while affordable for very large enterprises, this option is out of the price range and scope for SMEs. With their scale, cloud providers can afford highly qualified specialists in redundant facility design, network security, network operations and develop optimized products and processes. Public cloud data centers typically have at minimum SOC-2, ISO 27001 and PCI-DSS compliance and extend to federal compliance standards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Public cloud providers are starting to apply big data and AI techniques to monitoring their cloud operations looking for leakages and misconfiguration. Only the largest organization can afford or acquire this expertise inhouse. Public cloud providers rely on their brand to protect their business and invest accordingly, while many CIOs and IT manager will only be too aware that IT is still often considered a cost center.&nbsp; Hybrid-cloud storage enables SMEs to garner the benefits of cloud scale and efficiency including soft benefits of expertise and operational excellence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Physical data protection</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cloud protection starts with physical security protecting against theft, loss, accidents, power failures and natural disasters. Cloud data centers are physically secure, often in remote areas, with multiply redundant, backed-up power supplies, redundant telecom connections, have secure building physical security with controlled access and their size and nature of storage management makes it near impossible identify the physical location or device storing any one organizations data.&nbsp; By comparison many enterprises at best tend to have a single data center, while SMEs might just have an in-building server room or data closet.&nbsp; Very small companies may just have a NAS sitting unprotected on site.&nbsp;   To protect against physical data loss, it essential to have a physically separate offsite backup copy.&nbsp; Unsurprisingly, simple data backup to cloud is the oldest application and until the advent of big data with cloud compute one of the largest consumption of cloud storage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For physical separation, cloud storage is divided into redundancy or availability zones.&nbsp; Users can select from multiple zones within one data center (locally redundant) or data can be duplicated across different data centers in different locations in a region (zone redundant) or in different regions (geo-redundancy).&nbsp; Unlike traditional storage tiering or offsite backup, cloud-based storage is distributed across redundancy zones and handled by the cloud storage system software transparently to users.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protection from device failure</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The next stage is protection from data loss stemming from device failure.&nbsp; No matter the storage medium, there is always the risk of device failure, and with HDD its inevitable and Flash devices used in SSD will wear out.&nbsp; RAID technology was developed to protect against drive failure although with very large drives, RAID is increasingly less effective. For traditional storage, best practice in the industry is to follow a 3-2-1 backup strategy - backup to a second device and then backup to offsite.&nbsp; This quickly becomes expensive both in hardware and IT time spent on maintenance, time that could be spent on strategic business initiatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A variant of data loss is inadvertent or malicious deletion of data.&nbsp; Over time users, and even IT managers, utilizing file hosting and collaborative solutions such as Dropbox and Office 365 have become so accustomed to cloud reliability they assume files are always available.&nbsp; However, if a file is deleted it is only available for recovery for a short time.&nbsp; A 2015 study by EMC found the top causes of data loss were accidental deletion (41%), migration errors (31%) and accidental overwrites (26%).To protect against this several new products that provide cloud backup are becoming available especially for Office 365.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Data can also be lost via corruption by viruses or ransomware.&nbsp; Ransomware is the most prevalent incident of malware today, per Verizon's 2018 study of business risks. Another recent example including the WannaCry attack and the major metro of Atlanta, Georgia is still reeling from a major ransomware attack that crippled the city's applications, from payroll to public transportation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By using a hybrid-cloud architecture, the authoritative data storage is in the cloud and gains all the benefits of cloud storage covered below, while still presenting a traditional on-premises filer interface, with the added advantage that the filer is now no longer a critical, high maintenance component.&nbsp; As the filer is just a cache of the cloud data, if it is replaced it will simply replenish with most active files once accessed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Data in cloud storage is spread across multiple drives and data on the drives is managed throughout their lifecycle by the cloud provider to prevent data loss and make failed drive replacement transparent to the user.&nbsp; As noted above data can also be saved in geo-redundant locations for maximum protection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For additional protection the cloud object store can be configured with versioning and made immutable - meaning data can only be written not erased, although in practice time limits can be set for when erasure is enabled. &nbsp;&nbsp;This ensures any saved version of the file is always available for recovery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Disaster recovery/file level recovery&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With legacy NAS devices based on hard drives, we know that these drives will inevitably fail and it's only a matter of time before data must be recovered. As one of the most basic protection mechanisms available, disaster recovery is a storage function that everybody recognizes as an important baseline to have implemented. However, many businesses today are leveraging two different storage backup and Disaster Recovery (DR) strategies. They have one system for use as primary storage and another separate version for backup and recovery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leveraging the hybrid-cloud model streamlines this process significantly, as SMEs use the same cloud storage service for both primary storage and backup/DR. The hybrid-cloud storage architecture consolidates files into a single store. This is especially beneficial to organizations with multiple site as it avoids multiple copies being stored on separate File Servers for access with the attendant replication costs, active version headaches and overhead.&nbsp; With the scalability and falling cost of cloud storage, combined with full namespace visibility and cached cloud filers, it makes sense to just keep every file available in the cloud at all times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hybrid-cloud storage services support file-level restore combined with versioning that lets users find prior versions of their files, which means you can restore/backup individual files without having to deal with the whole data store. And all of these have a high-performance connection as part of the on-premise acceleration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protection from data loss and breach</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The third part of data protection is Protection from Data Breach incurred through human behavior.&nbsp; Many data breaches and even ransomware incidents start with phishing attacks through social engineering.&nbsp; Another problem especially with file hosting solutions is Shadow IT where employees upload restricted data to an unauthorized personal cloud file hosting application - such as Google Drive, OneDrive or Dropbox.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of these do NOT deliver encrypted end-to-end traffic, although this might be expected from more consumer-oriented services. &nbsp;The bigger issue is all these services readily facilitate file sharing and now IT has no knowledge of what files have been shared and with whom.&nbsp;&nbsp; This can easily violate industry compliances like CJIS (Criminal Justice Information Services), FERPA (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act), HIPAA&nbsp;(Health Insurance Portability &amp; Accountability Act), MPAA&nbsp;(Motion Picture Association of America) and GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation).&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Data breaches remain a significant IT problem, &nbsp;mostly a result of human error.&nbsp; While the best prevention is training, systems and process, an ongoing challenge is being aware a breach has incurred. By avoiding Shadow IT, Investing in Audit tools, using Identity Management like Azure AD combined with Device Management and encrypting files at rest and in-transit, breaches can be better avoided and identified when the do occur.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until recently there was no requirement to report breaches and they typically only became publicly known when they hit the news. The GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) changes that and makes Breach reporting mandatory. The GDPR which comes into effect May 25, 2018, with severe penalties, both monetary and otherwise, not only applies to organizations located within the EU but it will also apply to organizations located outside of the EU if they offer goods or services to, or monitor the behavior of, EU data subjects. It applies to all companies processing and holding the personal data of data subjects residing in the European Union, regardless of the company's location.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While most major cloud vendors (AWS, Azure, etc.) fully intend to be GDPR compliant, it's incumbent upon you and your IT organization to ensure your on-premises and global file system together make for a compliant storage architecture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By adopting a hybrid-cloud architecture with secure on-premises filers for access, encryption at rest and in transit, utilizing Identity and Device Management and Audit capabilities, preventing shadow IT and limiting who and how files can be shared, &nbsp;breaches can be minimized.&nbsp; In the unfortunate event of a breach, accurate log files, immutable data and versioning will speed forensics and recovery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maintaining security on an ongoing basis - audits/reviews</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, once you finally secure your hybrid-cloud storage architecture, there is no guarantee that it will stay that way! Constant vigilance is always warranted, as well as regularly checking on your platform to ensure it's still where it needs to be. As a result, you should perform regular cloud-compliance audits to make sure everything is as it should be. These audits can span both your cloud storage provider (or providers) and your own on-premise architecture piece as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In many ways, securing your business' data has become the most critical role for your IT group. As this dynamic market creates even more sophisticated attacks and glaring vulnerabilities, it will be IT's responsibility to stay ahead of the game. A hybrid-cloud storage architecture should smooth that pathway.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">MONEY; Pg. 2B</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">416 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Almost everybody who uses an online service or app that handles their data has been getting a flood of emails advising of privacy-policy changes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And it's not the U.S. behind the tech industry's recent flurry of updates. Instead, the European Union has been driving these changes with a sweeping set of privacy rules that will go into effect May 25 -- and which are also yielding benefits on this side of the Atlantic.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The EU's General Data Protection Regulation will require companies that handle the data of EU residents to provide them with far more control over that data. Among the key provisions of this roughly 54,000-word document:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Companies have to obtain users' permission in much more detail before using their information for marketing or advertising.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They have to let users inspect the data they've collected and correct it on request -- then delete it when it's no longer needed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They must allow users to download their data in a format they can then take to a competing service -- what's called data portability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People can challenge algorithmic decisions that affect them significantly and ask that humans make them instead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GDPR says nothing about how companies treat customers in other countries. But many U.S. firms that have had to rewrite privacy policies for Europe to avoid fines that could cost them billions of dollars are carrying over these changes to the States for  simplicity. That has  privacy advocates pleasantly surprised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I, like most consumers, have been getting a series of notifications from a lot of the apps that I use that they're updating their privacy policies effective May 25 -- that must not be a coincidence,&quot; laughed Terrell McSweeny, who on Friday wrapped up a four-year term on the Federal Trade Commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, many GDPR-driven privacy-policy rewrites take more care to describe how a company handles your data and offer clearer opt-outs to some of those uses. Another frequent change: simpler interfaces to adjust these settings, such as the revised privacy center Facebook will soon ship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But for American users, the GDPR's greatest gift is its data-portability mandate. When you can take your data and your business elsewhere, you have much more leverage as a customer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recently Instagram added an option to download your data, finally catching up to the data-export feature its corporate parent Facebook rolled out in 2010. Apple added its own data-portability feature as part of a round of GDPR-driven changes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Expect more changes such as this. <BR></SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Web surfers will start to see surprising new notices come May 25, when the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation takes effect. &quot;Welcome to BuzzFeed,&quot; one might say. &quot;May we use your data to tailor ads for you? Our partners will collect information and use cookies for ad personalization and measurement. You can say no.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It will be a new world for everyone who has long &quot;consented&quot; to publishers' terms as a condition of use-a condition that's banned under GDPR. Perhaps ironically, however, publishers are now the ones feeling coerced.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's because Google said on March 22 that publishers will need to share with it any data they get if they want to keep using its software to sell ads. Google won't disclose to publishers exactly how it uses that data, and should any GDPR violations occur, the liability will rest with publishers, not Google. Not everyone wants to say yes, but the alternative is daunting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In its simplest form, GDPR is &quot;setting guardrails around surveillance marketing and surveillance advertising,&quot; says Fatemeh Khatibloo, an analyst at Forrester. Most people understand that ads pay the bills for many services in a general sense, she says, but GDPR has arrived to make sure companies that &quot;track consumers all over the web and do modeling against personal information are obtaining consent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GDPR covers any business that operates in some way within the EU, even a U.S. publisher that gets 14 readers per month from Germany. Those found in violation face fines of around $25 million or 4 percent of annual revenue, whichever is greater.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite that, most companies haven't stressed: 48 percent of 1,000-plus companies surveyed say they won't make the EU's deadline, according to law firm McDermott Will &amp; Emery. For large tech companies, it's a different story. &quot;We all know who the EU is going to prosecute first,&quot; said one ad-tech executive, speaking on condition of anonymity to protect industry relationships. &quot;They're going to go after Google, Facebook, Amazon and eBay.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Suddenly, though, publishers face an unexpected bind. Declining Google's offer could provoke catastrophic financial consequences. It operates DoubleClick Bid Manager, the largest platform used by marketers to buy ads; Adx, the largest exchange; and DoubleClick for Publishers, something nearly every publisher on the planet uses to sell ads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;About 60 percent of our programmatic revenue comes from Google,&quot; says one executive at a major publishing outfit. &quot;We effectively have no choice but to agree.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Google says its terms make sense because it acts as a controller, which the EU defines as a body that &quot;alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data.&quot; Google makes &quot;decisions on data processing to help publishers optimize ad revenue,&quot; the company explains. &quot;That is consistent with the GDPR's definition of a controller. This designation does not give us any additional rights to data.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under GDPR, Google says it will use data for testing algorithms, improving user experiences and ensuring the accuracy of its ad forecasting system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Khatibloo, the Forrester analyst, says Google has put publishers in a bind without doing anything wrong. &quot;Publishers are on the hook to get consent, but they don't have a ton of control over what Google does with their data after a user leaves their site,&quot; she says. &quot;And that's the problem.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many publishers feel Google isn't operating in the spirit of GDPR, says Jason Kint, CEO of Digital Content Next, a U.S. trade association that represents publishers such as Hearst, Gannett and Vox Media, among many others. GDPR should be &quot;an opportunity because it allows the publisher to reassert control as the party that actually has the relationship with the user,&quot; he says. &quot;To make matters more offensive, Google is attempting to assert they are the controller over data that they collect off the publisher site and they want to use it however they see fit, which [is on top of] putting all the liability back on the publisher for what they do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But EU regulators keep Google under close watch, to be fair, and sketchy publishers do exist. Accepting liability on behalf of publishers would open Google to significant risk for violating GDPR, something that could cost it $4.4 billion in fines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The EU may have overlooked the complexities of ad tech, Khatibloo says. Others agree. &quot;The EU completely bobbled this,&quot; says an executive at one ad-tech firm. &quot;They thought this would really punish the tech vendors, but the people with the best deployment for GDPR were Google, Facebook, Amazon and eBay. Because the exact firms the EU wanted to punish were the ones who had the tightest relationship with users, but also the ones with the lawyers and engineers to handle the changes.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;So, how do you sustain a business where users do not pay for the service?&quot; Senator Orrin Hatch questioned Mark Zuckerberg, the co-founder and CEO of Facebook, during the hearing he held weeks ago. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zuckerberg between a committed smile responded: &quot;Senator, we market advertising.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> How is it possible that a US legislator does not know the basic concept of what he is trying to regulate? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lee: Investors say the Facebook crisis has passed </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For Juan Luis Hern&aacute;ndez Conde, lawyer and founder of the Novus Concilium law firm, specialized in technology, laws exist globally and can be applied to any topic that addresses a technology. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;From my perspective, I believe that people mistakenly believe that technology is not regulated. These people believe that the laws can not keep pace with technology but I think it is wrong, &quot;said the lawyer. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In fact, he says, the biggest problem is that both lawyers and legislators are not always aware of these innovations. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;What happens is that lawyers and judges do not know how technology works and by not knowing it they do not know how to apply the law,&quot; added Hern&aacute;ndez Conde. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For the lawyer, the greatest risk of seeking to legislate a technology without even understanding it is that it can inhibit the development of it. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hern&aacute;ndez Conde said that a poorly implemented regulation can stop both people and governments from using technology because of the simple fact of their legislation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> David D. Friedman, professor of law at the University of Santa Clara, located in the heart of Silicon Valley, said in a document that a good alternative to the technological advances that the world is experiencing is to have a broad legal framework. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> You may be interested: Facebook Local, the app that helps you find entertainment nearby </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If the rules are defined sufficiently broadly, legal innovation will never be necessary. Most of the problems posed by new technologies, for example, could be solved by a single rule, &quot;says Friedman. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In more advanced nations, giant steps have been taken to legislate and expand the right that users have, for example, in the handling of their data. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The European Union recently announced the implementation of the General Data Protection Regulation or GDPR, legislation that expands data protection standards for Europe and regulates all companies that have their headquarters in Europe. With this measure, users of technological platforms will have more control over the data that this type of company uses and also establishes large fines for the omission of the rules. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Mexico, new industries have also been legislated, including financial technology or fintech before its growth, issuing from scratch a regulation for companies and users of this type of services. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For Hern&aacute;ndez Conde, the main thing before trying to legislate a technology or innovation is to analyze if there is already a regulation that covers what is scheduled to be regularized. And in case there is no law, the correct thing is to issue one, as happened with the Fintech Law in Mexico. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hern&aacute;ndez Conde stressed that in the case of Mexico, for the Fintech Law, one of the qualities that the development of this regulation had was that the legislators surrounded themselves with ecosystem participants with the objective of better analyzing all the parts and technologies involved in said regulation. measure. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apple has at last introduced a new tool that lets you request and download everything the company knows about you, including all the data it gathers and retains when using the company's retail outlets, iCloud, apps, products, and services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why is this tool available?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In part, Apple has made this information available to bring it into line with Europe's GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) legislation, laws designed to better protect individual privacy in an online age.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Google, Facebook, Twitter, and almost every other company has also had to introduce these tools, making it far easier for users to compare the quantity and depth of information these unconstrained corporations hold about them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[ Further reading: Private by design: Why Apple's iOS meets the needs of healthcare IT&nbsp;]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is particularly necessary following the revelations that company's such as Cambridge Analytica have been using access to such data in political campaigning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unlike most industry peers, Apple has always argued for strong customer privacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've never believed that these detailed profiles of people, that have incredibly deep personal information that is patched together from several sources, should exist,&quot;&nbsp;Apple CEO Tim Cook recently said. They can be &quot;abused against our democracy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What sort of information does Apple keep?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apple doesn't keep anything like the quantity of personal data its competitors keep. The information it does keep is frequently anonymized; it doesn't keep location data, but does keep hold of information concerning apps and other digital products you purchase. It holds lists of all the books, music, movies, and in-app purchases. It also tracks when you update apps. You'll also find it lists all your iTunes Match-stored tracks.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apple warns that it &quot;may decline to process requests that are frivolous/vexatious, jeopardize the privacy of others, are extremely impractical, or for which access is not otherwise required by local law.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One more thing about Apple ID security</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It cannot be stressed how important your Apple ID is becoming. Not only does it enable access to all the data Apple holds about you, but it unlocks all your personal data in the cloud, from images to emails, documents, and more. Given the presence of devices to hack data from your iOS devices and the constancy of cyber crime, I cannot stress enough the need to use complex passcodes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Further information</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apple as a company has an extensive privacy governance structure as described in this document. Apple's privacy policies, tools, and reports are described in much more detail at the&nbsp;Privacy section of its website.</SPAN></P>

The changes are being announced in emails, blog posts and new on-screen messages that many consumers are already beginning to see from Apple, Twitter, Airbnb, GoDaddy and others. Facebook users will receive new privacy prompts in the coming weeks. Don't bother thanking Washington, which remains mired in gridlock despite rising public concerns about data privacy. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rather the changes emanate from the European Union, which is imposing a host of new regulations that are forcing global changes, including for hundreds of millions tech consumers in the United States. Privacy advocates warn that these changes won't fundamentally change the relationship between consumers and tech companies, many of which make their profits by collecting data on users, building individual profiles and selling advertising based on the resulting troves of data. &quot;I don't know that these companies are making radical differences in what they're doing,&quot; said Justin Brookman, director of consumer privacy and technology policy for Consumers Union. But the changes do mark a rare shift toward greater user control and transparency as companies scramble to comply with the European regulations. Those that fail to do so could face fines of up to 4 percent of global profits. The new laws, known as GDPR, for General Data Protection Regulation, take effect May 25 in the European Union. They require that tech companies use plain language to explain how their data will be used and that users give explicit consent for these uses. As companies create new ways of using data, they must ask again for permission. Under GDPR, users also are gaining new rights to download their data and move it to other platforms. And there are new restrictions on data collection on users under the age of 16, unless parents or guardians consent. Companies are not required to apply these same regulations outside the European Union. Some, such as Twitter, said they will implement privacy rules differently in the United States and Europe. WhatsApp, which is owned by Facebook, announced this week that it was raising the minimum user age to 16 in Europe but leaving it at 13 for users in the rest of the world, including the United States. Many others, however, are choosing to adopt a single global standard because of the logistical challenges of maintaining two sets of privacy regimes and also to avoid the potential political and public-relations backlash for giving protections to one set of consumers and not others. Companies say there may be minor variations between privacy standards in the E.U. and the U.S. but not to a degree most users would notice. Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg, during congressional testimony this month, said his company would apply the European standards to U.S. users. A company blog post later elaborated, &quot;Everyone -- no matter where they live -- will be asked to review important information about how Facebook uses data and make choices about their privacy on Facebook.&quot; Facebook users in the United States are scheduled in coming weeks to see a series of new consent screens explaining how the company collects and uses personal data and asking permission for these uses. There will be questions specifically seeking consent for facial recognition technology, which Facebook for years has employed to identify people in photos uploaded to the platform. (The technology will be new, however, in the European Union and Canada, and people there will be asked to consent to its use for the first time.) Google says that it too is applying the same privacy standards globally across its many online services, though, as with Facebook, there may be minor variations in how these standards are applied. Apple, which relies less on the collection of personal data than some other big tech companies, last month added new privacy protections in updates of its operating systems to comply with GDPR. Those updates applied to users worldwide, the company said, and created new alerts to signal when Apple collects user data. The company also is allowing all users to request their data, seek corrections and demand that any account be deleted. One outlier is Twitter, which said that it is adopting a single, unified privacy policy for users throughout the world but implementing it differently outside of Europe, meaning users in the United States will see different explanations and requests for consent. &quot;Our first priority is to meet the EU requirements to comply with GDPR on May 25th,&quot; the company said in a statement. &quot;People around the world use our service in different ways and therefore how we present features must be customized by region.&quot; The uneven responses among the companies are frustrating privacy advocates, who argue that the arrival of GDPR offers an opportunity for fundamental change -- beyond just a series of new explanations and consent boxes that users are asked to check. &quot;They're just trying to get away with business as usual,&quot; said Jeff Chester of the Center for Digital Democracy, a consumer advocacy group.</SPAN></P>

Now, the company says that when you reply to someone, or to a group, usernames will no longer count toward those 140 characters. In the fall of 2016, Twitter said it would stop counting photos, videos, quote tweets, polls and GIF animations toward the character limit.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vol. 1</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">No. 1</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1132  words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We've been hearing about the General Data Protection Regulation and its impending May 25 compliance deadline for months now, and most of the discussions have provoked fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD) around the new data protection law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's easy to see why many organizations are panicking; the GDPR imposes the most serious financial consequences of any privacy law to date (the most severe infringements will cost 20 million EUR or four percent of global revenue, whichever is greater). On top of that, non-compliance can result in lost customer trust and revenue.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, while &quot;GDPR-phobia&quot; may be understandable, it's not necessary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Organizations have been working to comply with various government regulations for decades; the GDPR is just the latest law taking the world by storm. And the data protection methods needed to adhere to the GDPR are not new - in fact, they're measures that have served as the foundation of information security and compliance efforts for more than 20 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It stands to reason that, if you know how to keep data protected, you know how to keep data protected under the GDPR. To prove it, let's examine four GDPR technical measures designed to protect data as well as tactical best practices to achieve each. I'm willing to bet that you're farther along the compliance path than you think.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GDPR Mandate 1: Take a risk-based approach to data protection and security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This GDPR measure requires organizations to analyze their environment and determine the right data protection methods to remove as much risk as possible. And, as IT and security professionals, this is something we do day in and day out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To identify and assess risk under the GDPR, you must first understand your existing network infrastructure as well as the hazards that could lead to GDPR compliance drift. There are three core elements of this orientation process that can help you determine your current risk landscape:</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><UL CLASS="c9"><LI CLASS="c10"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"><NOBR>&bull;</NOBR></SPAN></P>
<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Network Assets, Topologies and Policies - Knowing your assets is a fundamental component of any information security program, and it's equally important for GDPR compliance. Knowing the inherent risks associated with each independent asset in your environment is critical to taking a risk-based approach to data protection and security. Network topologies reveal just how these assets can communicate and travel, and therefore signal transferable compromise and potential points of non-compliance. And network policies can help you move beyond what you have (assets) and how they relate (topologies) to what is allowed within context and framework.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
</LI><LI CLASS="c10"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"><NOBR>&bull;</NOBR></SPAN></P>
<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vulnerabilities - Vulnerability awareness answers the question: Where could it happen? It helps you determine vulnerabilities that could impact GDPR compliance and enables you to evaluate your current position in the context of threats, exposures, attackers and security hygiene.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
</LI><LI CLASS="c10"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"><NOBR>&bull;</NOBR></SPAN></P>
<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Threat Intelligence - The final piece of the puzzle is determining what could be exploited and how. When you apply threat intelligence to your network assets, topologies, policies and vulnerabilities, you gain knowledge of similar assets compromised in the wild; how compromise could spread; which pathways are open to exploit; and the likeliest targets within the network.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With an accurate understanding of the current risk landscape, you can create a risk-based approach to data protection and security that aligns with GDPR regulations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GDPR Mandate 2: Establish technical measures to validate that data is protected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Articles 5 and 30 of the GDPR require organizations to demonstrate that data is protected. To validate compliance in this way, organizations must perform regular analysis and take action when security and compliance risks are identified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are five standard methods of analysis that can help organizations validate that their data is protected and GDPR-compliant - security configuration assessments, attack simulations, traffic flow analysis, quantitative risk scores and audits. Your organization is likely already using at least one of these processes already.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GDPR Mandate 3: Continuously monitor data protection measures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In simple terms, this mandate requires organizations to continuously look at their network in real-time to see if all is well. Non-compliance does not happen immediately after calibrating networks to conform to regulatory guidelines. Rather, compliance drift happens over time - slowly and often without notice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Knowing there is a tendency to drift, European Union regulators have included guidelines within the GDPR for continuous monitoring. Article 32 of the GDPR states that organizations must have: &quot;a process for regular testing, assessing and evaluating the effectiveness of technical and organizational measures for ensuring the security of data processing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Organizations are called to maintain ongoing, real-time, continuous compliance. Real-time monitoring, scaled data ingest (that supports high-throughput) and customizable reporting - all things that your organization is likely already doing to demonstrate continuous compliance with other regulations - can help you easily satisfy this GDPR mandate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GDPR Mandate 4: Correct any protection failures and notify the authorities when compromised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As you acknowledge your current state, take note of what could happen and monitor real-time network drift, you can put a bow on GDPR preparation with change orchestration that enforces security at every corner of the global network. This is the only way to correct protection failures under the GDPR regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Security control, the essential nature of orchestration, is specifically voiced in Article 28: &quot;Any data processor must have technical and organizational control to ensure data protection and documentation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This can be a management burden because you have to account for GDPR standards with every change or provision to the network. However, orchestration gives you central control over thousands of network devices and firewalls, thousands of policies and hundreds of thousands of rules to meet compliance requirements and keep your network resilient. By taking compliance standards and automating policy change, you can be confident that data is protected in perfect harmony with GDPR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fear Not</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People tend to fear what they do not understand. Even at this late stage there is still massive confusion surrounding the GDPR, and when paired with security vendor FUD, it's easy to understand why so many organizations are worried about demonstrating compliance. However, taking the deliberate steps outlined above, you can plan for GDPR compliance in the same way you did for previous regulatory battles. The opponent might be different, but the preparation is the same.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If your organization prioritizes a strong security program, then you already have the tools you need to achieve GDPR compliance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Changes are spurred by stricter E.U. rules on consent for data use </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Users of Facebook, Google and other popular technology platforms are likely to benefit from stricter privacy regulations that, beginning next month, will require new disclosures, new forms of consent and new power to limit how personal data is stored and utilized.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The changes are being announced in emails, blog posts and new on-screen messages that many consumers are beginning to see from Apple, Twitter, Airbnb, GoDaddy and others. Facebook users will receive new privacy prompts in the coming weeks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington remains mired in gridlock despite rising public concerns about data privacy. Instead the changes emanate from the European Union, which is imposing new regulations that are forcing global changes, including for hundreds of millions of tech consumers in the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Privacy advocates warn that these changes won't fundamentally alter the relationship between consumers and tech companies, many of which make their profits by collecting data on users, building individual profiles and selling advertising based on the resulting troves of data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know that these companies are making radical differences in what they're doing,&quot; said Justin Brookman, director of consumer privacy and technology policy for Consumers Union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the changes mark a rare shift toward greater user control and transparency as companies scramble to comply with the European regulations. Those that fail to do so could face fines of up to 4 percent of global profits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new laws, known as GDPR for General Data Protection Regulation, take effect May 25 in the European Union. They require that tech companies use plain language to explain how their data will be used and that users give explicit consent for these uses. As companies create new ways of using data, they must ask again for permission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under GDPR, users also are gaining new rights to download their data and move it to other platforms. And there are new restrictions on data collection on users younger than 16, unless parents or guardians consent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Companies are not required to apply these same regulations outside the European Union. Some, such as Twitter, said they will implement privacy rules differently in the United States and Europe. WhatsApp, which is owned by Facebook, announced this week that it was raising the minimum user age to 16 in Europe but leaving it at 13 for users in the rest of the world, including the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many others, however, are choosing to adopt a single global standard because of the logistical challenges of maintaining two sets of privacy standards and also to avoid the potential political and public-relations backlash for giving protections to one set of consumers and not others. Companies say there may be minor variations between privacy standards in the E.U. and the United States but not to a degree most users would notice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg, during congressional testimony this month, said his company would apply the European standards to U.S. users. A company blog post later elaborated, &quot;Everyone - no matter where they live - will be asked to review important information about how Facebook uses data and make choices about their privacy on Facebook.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook users in the United States are scheduled to see new consent screens explaining how the company collects and uses personal data and asking permission for these uses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There will be questions specifically seeking consent for facial recognition technology, which Facebook for years has employed to identify people in photos uploaded to the platform. (The technology will be new, however, in the E.U. and Canada, and people there will be asked to consent to its use for the first time.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Google says that it, too, is applying the same privacy standards globally across its many online services, although as with Facebook there may be minor variations in how these standards are applied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apple, which relies less on the collection of personal data than some other big tech companies, last month added new privacy protections in updates of its operating systems to comply with GDPR. Those updates applied to users worldwide, the company said, and created new alerts to signal when Apple collects user data. The company also is allowing all users to request their data, seek corrections and demand that any account be deleted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One outlier is Twitter, which said that it is adopting a single, unified privacy policy for users throughout the world but implementing it differently outside Europe, meaning users in the United States will see different explanations and requests for consent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our first priority is to meet the E.U. requirements to comply with GDPR on May 25,&quot; the company said in a statement. &quot;People around the world use our service in different ways and therefore how we present features must be customized by region.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The uneven responses among the companies are frustrating privacy advocates, who argue that the arrival of GDPR offers an opportunity for fundamental change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're just trying to get away with business as usual,&quot; said Jeff Chester of the Center for Digital Democracy, a consumer advocacy group.</SPAN></P>

If you wish, you can already download absolutely all the information that you have entered or generated on Instagram. &gt;&gt; The social network of photographs, which belongs to Facebook, was the only one that did not allow its users to obtain all their data. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even, it is not even possible to save the photos published from the app.&gt;&gt; But the scandal of data leakage on Facebook after it became known that Cambridge Analytica used the data of 87 million users to persuade them during the elections of the United States. United in 2016, it forced the company of Mark Zuckerberg to announce a series of measures and changes in all its platforms, including Instagram.&gt;&gt; Last April 11, the social network, which has about 800 million users throughout the world, had announced the implementation of this new tool, which is available from this Wednesday on the web version of the platform. &gt;&gt; To download all your information you must go to your profile and click on the configuration button. In the section &quot;Privacy and security&quot; you will find the option &quot;Data download&quot;. Then you must enter your email to which you will receive a link to download the file. Instagram reports that they can only work on one account request at a time, so it is possible that the process of collecting and sending the data takes up to 48 hours. For security, the file will only be available for four days and it is advisable to download it to your personal computer. &gt;&gt; The launch of the tool is given a month before the new General Regulation of Data Protection (GDPR) of the European Union comes into force, which establishes that companies must provide their customers with the portability of their data so that they have a greater control of them. &gt; The new rules establish, among other things, greater restrictions on the part of companies of the use of sensitive data such as racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, the treatment of genetic data and sexual life or sexual orientation. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c6">Has the Facebook crisis passed?</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">470  words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After publishing its quarterly report, confidence in Facebook returned with its shares growing to 7.71% in after hours on Wednesday after presenting its results. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For investors, it seems that the worst crisis of the company founded by Mark Zuckerberg has passed. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;For our taste the crisis has ended and this is shared by more than 50% of investors in the United States and this is derived from the fact that the station has had a good reaction,&quot; says Juan Carlos Minero, director of investment management at Black WallStreet Capital. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lee: Facebook income, untouchable despite Cambridge Analytica </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since March, the role of Facebook had depreciated 13.57%. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to Minero, the good results delivered in the first three months of the year offset the crisis that the company went through since mid-March and the regulatory issue that was raised in Europe. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> From January to March, Facebook recorded sales of 11.970 million dollars, compared to 11.41 billion dollars that analysts consulted by Thomson Reuters predicted. Revenues were 32% higher than the 8.032 million dollars reported in the same period of 2017. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the difficulties for Facebook's business may not have ended completely. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The company, together with other digital advertising companies, will face in the European Union a regulation that could affect their business models. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As of May 25, the General Regulation of Data Protection or GDPR will come into effect in the countries that make up the European block. This measure extends the rights of people with respect to data access and transfer of these that companies like Facebook have. For the user, the regulation means more control over how these companies make use of their information. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a call with investors, Facebook CFO Dave Wehner said that the privacy requirements for Facebook and the other companies could impact the growth of users in Europe to such an extent that in the second quarter the growth remains flat and even decreases. in that region. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It may interest you: Almost a million Mexicans affected by Cambridge Analytca </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although Europe is the third region with the largest number of users on Facebook (377 million people), this area represents the highest income for the company with 3,026 million dollars. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;When you think about the ways in which people restrict the use of their information, I think it could affect the product. There are many ways in which we use the information to make our product better, &quot;said Sheryl Sandberg, the company's operations director. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sandberg added that the modification in the use of data by users could affect to some extent the scope that some advertising campaigns have through the platform. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There is a potential impact for the targeting of the campaigns. I think that's the problem we see about how the GDPR can affect, &quot;Wehner said. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In source systems, we - or the IT or finance department - often hold some pretty strong views on who should get access to which data, with shared file folders ideally having limited access according to business roles and needs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, log-ins in ERP systems typically restrict access for shop assistants and warehouse workers who can see less information than managers and the finance department. And it goes without saying that payroll is often the most restricted area, since a lot of sensitive and personal data is stored there.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The moment data leaves the source systems for a BI front-end like Tableau, Power BI or Qlik, we often neglect the importance of security rules.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sometimes, security is neglected due to forgetfulness, other times it is more a matter of turning the blind eye towards it. When addressed directly, some technicians will state that the main reason for not going all in for data security in BI and analytics is the lack of options. They simply lack a tool, a place, or a way to implement security without having to manually hand code access rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This hand coding is required in numerous apps or as a way to maintain various connect strings in a data source or even as parameters in a spreadsheet or text file so that systems can look up security privileges and variables that are used to interconnect in a semi-automated way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Security Layer? Yes, Please!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No matter what stage of the data life cycle and no matter which tool you use - even if you're just accessing data sources via an Excel spreadsheet - security measures should always be applied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recognizing this as an important issue for a BI platform, some modern solutions are now available to solve the task of security. A few of these solutions are part of a company's BI platform, residing as functionality in the data warehouse, and can offer access rights (on tables and fields) granted on the level of business user roles or based on the content of a specific field.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As an example, in this way, your French sales team can only see sales in France, while the German sales team can focus on German sales, even though they are both looking at the same dataset and using the same front-end tool or app.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One important consideration to actively decide is who should get access to data. Another piece of the puzzle is to keep the overview of data accessible, where it's all stored and how it's all connected. Yes, I am talking about documentation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Documentation Adds to Security</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most programmers, software developers, data warehouse modelers and others working in similar areas find writing documentation to be one of the least desired tasks at all. It often ends up at the bottom of the to-do list or the back side of the list, never to be checked off as a completed action item.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But having up-to-date documentation lets you keep track of changes made in the data model over time, as well as to answer any questions regarding current dependencies in data and where your data should reside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adding to that, is also holds the benefits of having a resource telling you how measures are calculated, ensuring fast response whenever someone questions where a certain number originates from and which data fields it's based on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By choosing a platform that supports automation for the task of writing and maintaining documentation, you get the benefit of either freeing up personnel that can be used to add more data sources or build more data models for analytics and self-service BI.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is true that if the current status of documentation is at a bare minimum and you do not wish to raise the bar very little time would be saved, but having the automation still makes it a lot easier to get an overview of the data, where it is used and with needed security levels. The end result would be saving a lot of time when it comes to answering questions about your data, as well as making it easier for compliance when it comes to audits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you, your data protection officer, DPO, or someone from external audits likeGDPR, want to look over shoulders, the documentation is only one click away and always up-to-date, revealing who has access to which data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As things stand in your business right now, dare you ask the all-important question: Do you know exactly who has access to which data in your current environment? Even more, do you need to conduct a data audit? If so,you might like &quot;4 steps to conducting a GDPR compliance audit.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kon Leong</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vol. 1</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">No. 1</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">815  words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the May 25 General Data Protection Regulation deadline almost upon us, some organizations are still searching for the right talent to manage their compliance strategies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether an organization is looking for a data protection officer, a managed services provider, a consultant or a chief privacy officer, an understanding of GDPR's technological challenges is essential. Finding professionals who realize the underlying components of data privacy and what makes them so difficult to implement could save organizations from massive sanctions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here then are three challenges that any GDPR professional or vendor should understand.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GDPR is a whole different animal</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GDPR's requirement to find and potentially remediate personal data upon request-articles 15 to 18- has drawn comparisons to eDiscovery. This is understandable, and on the surface the two are similar: Both processes involve searching for relevant documents in enterprise repositories and producing them. As a result, some organizations and vendors are approaching GDPR searches as somewhat of an extension of eDiscovery. However, there are fundamental differences in the requirements of the two that make GDPR searches far more difficult.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For instance, eDiscovery requires you to find a single copy of each relevant document; GDPR requires you to find every copy. In eDiscovery you only have to search a small portion of enterprise repositories related to the custodian; GDPR requires you to search across the entire enterprise. There's a long list of differences between eDiscovery and GDPR searches that make most eDiscovery tools on their own insufficient.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In short, GDPR is in many ways unlike anything we've seen. Therefore, when hiring for GDPR it is prudent to ensure a candidate is aware of the aspects in which GDPR and eDiscovery depart. A keen understanding in this area will be an indicator of a candidate's success.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GDPR respects no silos</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As information management is concerned, today's organizations are largely silo-based. Data is stored in numerous repositories across the enterprise, including:</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><UL CLASS="c9"><LI CLASS="c10"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"><NOBR>&bull;</NOBR></SPAN></P>
<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Format-based silos (email, file share, SharePoint, ECM, etc.)&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
</LI><LI CLASS="c10"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"><NOBR>&bull;</NOBR></SPAN></P>
<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Geographical location-based silos&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
</LI><LI CLASS="c10"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"><NOBR>&bull;</NOBR></SPAN></P>
<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Management-based silos (cloud vs. hybrid, in place vs. archive)&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
</LI><LI CLASS="c10"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"><NOBR>&bull;</NOBR></SPAN></P>
<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Function-based silos (eDiscovery, regulatory compliance, records management, etc.)&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problem is that each of these silos often has distinct management policies, a unique search engine, and there exists a general lack of coordination between them all. Bridging across these silos is becoming one of the greatest IT challenges of our time, and GDPR compliance is heavily impacted by this challenge. In fact, the two puzzles are interrelated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How does an organization search across each repository simultaneously to find a subject's personal data, and when they find it, how can they quickly understand the purposes for which it's being used across the enterprise?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Data may have several duplicates being used for different functions, and each of the functions may have different policies associated with it. In other words, records management may call to retain a document for X number of years while regulatory compliance calls to retain it for Y number of years, and now GDPR calls to delete it. How can an organization reconcile conflicting policies between these function-based silos if there isn't adequate communication between them?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When hiring a GDPR professional, he or she should have a grasp on the obstacles that face siloed architectures, and their impact on GDPR. Unfortunately, it's rare to find someone who truly realizes these issue, let alone someone who has a solution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">True privacy is complicated</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are two camps when it comes to data privacy. On one side there are those that think privacy is preserved by leaving personal data untouched. This is an intuitive approach because it seems natural that to maintain privacy, one should not go digging around for personal information. However, the issue is that when personal data exists that is not accounted for, it will inevitably be accessed by someone, and this can have negative consequences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For instance, data that is meant to be kept protected might end up being processed for analytics purposes, leading to several potential liabilities, including GDPR violations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A better is one in which organizations index all documents as they're created and apply rules-based policies to manage retention and remediation. Personal data can be readily searched, managed, and given access privileges to ensure it isn't misused. While this holistic system of information governance calls for a degree of initial intrusion into the content of all documents, it ultimately protects the privacy of data subjects because documents are only used for legitimate purposes, and personal data can be remediated when needed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These are some of the fundamental components of data privacy that few GDPR professionals grasp.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mastercard has appointed Caroline Louveaux, one of its longtime data privacy experts, to be chief privacy officer, operating from the company's offices in Brussels.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Louveaux, who's worked at Mastercard for more than a decade overseeing regional privacy and data protection programs internationally, Mastercard said in a Thursday press release.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In her new post Louveaux will work closely withJoAnn Stonier, who was chief privacy officer until Mastercard named her as its first chief data officer in February. Louveaux's team will work on data innovation and ensuring that privacy is embedded in all solutions that collect, use and share personal information, Mastercard said in the release.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mastercard's decision to base Louveaux in Brussels underscores Europe's escalating role in driving global privacy policy and the importance of the European General Data Protection Regulation, which sets a new global standard in handling individuals' personal information, Mastercard noted in the release.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There has never been a greater emphasis on privacy or questions about how companies are measuring up,&quot; said Tim Murphy, Mastercard's general counsel, in the release.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Louveaux lectures at the Solvay Brussels School of Economics and Management and serves as co-chair of the EU GDPR group of the Information Accountability Foundation and is a member of the GDPR Steering Committee of the Centre of Information Policy &amp; Leadership, the release noted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The WhatsApp instant messaging application raised to 16 years the minimum age that its users must have in the European Union (EU), compared to 13 until now, in anticipation of a law on personal data protection that will come into force in the bloc. next month. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If you live in a country of the European Union you must have at least 16 years to use our services,&quot; WhatsApp reported on its website. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On his blog, the application said he was preparing for the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) law, which will come into effect on May 25. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the law, you must be 16 years of age to give your consent to the use of your personal data. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Next month, the European Union will update its privacy laws to demand greater transparency about how people's information is used online,&quot; WhatsApp said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;WhatsApp is updating its conditions of use and privacy policy where the law known as General Regulation of Data Protection (GDPR) will come into force,&quot; he added. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The minimum age to use the popular instant messaging application is still 13 years outside the European Union. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This IT pilot fish has spent the past year and a half helping his company's clients prepare for the European Union's upcoming General Data Protection Regulation, and with a month to go, it's been smooth sailing -- mostly.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over the last 18 months I've been asking my customers time and again about their readiness to implement the GDPR rules,&quot; says fish. &quot;We have mostly small companies as our customers, family businesses and one-to-ten-person outfits, and most of them had need of our services one way or another.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But one customer, a lawyer, told me every time that this particular set of rules does not apply to him, because everything he does is governed by an obligation to confidentiality. Ten weeks before the final date, he still thought it had nothing to do with him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But then the lawyer attends a seminar hosted by a professional group, where he is told otherwise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the next day, fish's company gets a letter from the lawyer informing them that the lawyer has filed charges against the company for neglect of duty because fish didn't inform him of the legal implications of the GDPR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fish reads the letter. Then he checks to make sure his copies of his messages to the lawyer are where they're supposed to be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I keep all my correspondence in write-once archives with digital signing and all the other nice things archiving systems can do,&quot; fish says. &quot;I made a nice bundle for my own lawyer, put it on a thumb drive and walked over to his office.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fish's lawyer reads the other lawyer's letter -- twice -- and bursts out laughing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After about five minutes, he composes himself and drafts a very lawyery letter to his colleague, informing him that it would be his pleasure to drag the other lawyer before a court and to rip his reputation to shreds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ten days after that, another letter arrives -- a one-sentence letter from the other lawyer, informing fish that the lawyer has withdrawn his charges and doesn't want anything to do with fish ever again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I bundled his data on a DDS cartridge -- well aware that he does not own a DDS drive -- and sent it via courier to his office,&quot; says fish. &quot;The Termination of Contract, usually to be sent three months in advance, I included in the bundle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I definitely love getting rid of this kind of customer.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The seemingly endless studies on corporate readiness for the pending General Data Protection Regulation demonstrate that data truly can be made to say just about anything. And if recent surveys are to be believed, organizations are either fairly well prepared for the new data privacy mandate &quot; or they will fail miserably at compliance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As evidence, consider the results of two different studies of GDPR compliance readiness that were both released this week. One paints a fairly optimistic picture of corporate readiness. The other tells a tale of doom.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First, for the good news.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Companies are taking the new General Data Protection Regulation much more seriously than the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability (HIPAA) and Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council (PCI SSC), according to a survey conducted by Propeller Insights on behalf of Web application security company Netsparker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About half of the more than 300 senior security executives surveyed online in March (49 percent) said their organizations are 75 percent of the way through the process of being compliant with GDPR, a set of regulations the European Union (EU) to protect citizens' sensitive data from cyber security breaches. Organizations that fail to comply will face penalties when GDPR goes into effect May 25, 2018.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than two thirds of the organizations (71 percent) are confident that they'll be fully compliant by the deadline, but many of the organizations surveyed still are not compliant with PCI and HIPAA, the report said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In preparation for GDPR, 57 percent of companies are re-engineering internal systems and procedures, 55 percent are recruiting new people specifically to tackle GDPR compliance, and 48 percent are re-engineering internal security teams.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For some, the cost of GDPR compliance will be steep, the report said. About one quarter of the organizations (24 percent) will spend between $100,000 and $1 million, and one in 10 said GDPR compliance will cost their business more than $1 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">See AlsoUse the GDPR to jump-start data governance initiatives</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, for the bad news.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A study by SAS on global readiness reveals that only 7 percent of U.S. organizations consider themselves as GDPR compliant at this time, and only 30 percent expect to be by the May 25, 2018 deadline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The picture is slightly better in Europe, where 53 percent of organizations surveyed expect to be GDPR compliant by May 25. Among global organizations, expected compliance falls to 46 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The SAS survey does agree that data privacy is getting more attention, fueled in large part by the recent revelations of data sharing by Facebook with Cambridge Analytica. It also agrees that the financial implications of non-compliance with GDPR have served as a wake-up call for many organizations on the need for better data transparence and security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some 93 percent of organizations in the SAS study do have a compliance plan in place, or they expect to have one. A majority of respondents also expect to gain long-term benefits in the areas of data management and data governance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Consumers are now demanding the kind of trust that GDPR requires,&quot; noted Todd Wright, senior product marketing manager at SAS. &quot;Organizations that comply will have much stronger data management that leads to increased productivity and a better understanding and ability to serve their customers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anticipated benefits from GDPR compliance and data privacy efforts, according to the SAS survey respondents are:</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the messy scandals and controversies surrounding Facebook lately, the social media giant ended the first three months of 2018 barely scathed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook posted on Wednesday a 50 percent surge in revenue to $11.97 billion and a 63 percent increase in profit to $5 billion for the quarter which ended March 31. Both numbers beat&nbsp;Wall Street forecasts.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The platform also&nbsp;added&nbsp;70 million users during the quarter, the largest quarterly user growth since 2011, pushing Facebook's monthly user count to 2.2 billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Investors and the general public are eager to see how the recent Cambridge Analytica scandal and the #DeleteFacebook movement on social media will affect Facebook's bottom line, but because most of these incidents happened in late March and April, the real impact won't show until Facebook's next quarterly release.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During a conference call on Wednesday, both CEO&nbsp;Mark Zuckerberg and COO Sheryl Sandberg downplayed the earnings numbers by focusing on the &quot;many issues&quot; Facebook needs to address throughout the rest of 2018, although they didn't offer much new information beyond what they had told the media and regulators earlier this month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zuckerberg assured investors that Facebook won't change its business model of selling ads. In fact, he doesn't think Facebook's advertising is large enough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We think ads are a great business model. There may be other services we can launch, but general strategy has been to offer those services at cost and use them to help drive more ad sales,&quot; Zuckerberg said. &quot;It's the right way to build a service to connect everyone around the world.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ads are a natural fit for us. It allows us to provide a free service to the world.&quot; Sandberg echoed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When asked about how Facebook will diversify its revenue streams moving forward, if at all, Sandberg said the company is looking to expand advertising on Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp, which &quot;still have a lot of room for growth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Multiple analysts brought up the potential impact of the European Union's GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CFO David Wehner said he doesn't expect GDPR to cause any major impact on Facebook's advertising business, which made up 91 percent of total revenue in the first quarter, up from 85 percent a year ago.</SPAN></P>

Not only do they have to be sure the acquired company has good security, but they can't let their guard down even after the acquisition closes.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was an issue for Prague-based security company Avast, whichacquiredPiriform, a small London-based firm, best known for its widely used CCleaner tool. Unbeknownst to both Piriform and Avast, the former's servers had been hacked a few months earlier, and the hackers were waiting patiently for the best opportunity to strike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a security issue that could just as easily affect a payments company - and in some cases, already has. In 2014, identity theft protection provider Lifelockhad to pullits recently acquired Lemon wallet app off the market after it determined it was not compliant with the Payment Card Industry data security standards. In December of last year, PayPal had tochange its plansafter it was found that personal and financial data of up to 1.6 million customers of TIO Networks, a Canadian company PayPal had recently acquired, had been exposed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Avast incident reentered the conversation when the company's CTO, Ondrej Vlcek, brought new details to light at last week's RSA conference in San Francisco. What's striking is that the attackers chose to remain dormant until after the sale was completed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The attackers were in the Piriform network five months before they snuck the malicious payload into the CCleaner build. Avast acquired Piriform on July 18, 2017 and the first CCleaner build with the malicious payload appeared on August 2, 2017,&quot; Vlcek said ina blog postthat complemented his presentation. &quot;It's interesting it took them so long before they initiated their attack on CCleaner users.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When a company is acquired, the buying company is supposed to perform due diligence and check things like the value of the company, the amount of bad debt and whether regulators would approve of the acquisition. But the security risks the acquired company is exposed to are too often ignored.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;M&amp;A due diligence has to go beyond just legal and financial matters,&quot; Vlcek wrote. &quot;Companies need to strongly focus on cybersecurity, and for us this has now become one of the key areas that require attention during an acquisition process. Second, the supply chain hasn't been a key priority for businesses, but this needs to change. Attackers will always try to find the weakest link, and if a product is downloaded by millions of users it is an attractive target for them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GDPR, the EU's data protection regulation that will come into force next month, is probably going to make this even more important, as companies will have an obligation to proactively account for the integrity and security of customer data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In any acquisition, the buyer doesn't just buy a brand, a product, assets and a customer base; it also acquires the company's security posture.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leonid Bershidsky | Bloomberg View</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">987 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Internet users throughout the European Union -- and, in some cases, in the rest of the world as well -- are starting to get gently pushed toward accepting various companies' new service and privacy terms that comply with the EU's General Data Protection Regulation, which is going into effect on May 25. Trying to deal with it has convinced me that the tech industry is still determined to get privacy wrong, and the GDPR as applied by them doesn't prevent it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GDPR-related reminders are coming from stores, electronics manufacturers, social networks, even nonprofits. One needs to be intensely privacy-minded to go through the legal documents updated by Facebook, Twitter, Fitbit, Sonos, an e-commerce site you may have visited a few years ago or a local theater company and not get confused about which disclosures you saw in which statement. Though most firms have made an attempt to write the new terms in plain language, as the GDPR requires, these are still lengthy documents crafted for legal compliance first and understanding second.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The standard approach is to hit the user with thousands of words explaining what data is collected and how it is used and, within the text, provide links to settings pages where one can opt in and out of the data harvesting and processing. Here's how Fitbit handles it</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We give you account settings and tools to control our data use. For example, through your privacy settings, you can limit how your information is visible to other users of the Services; using your notification settings, you can limit the notifications you receive from us; and under your application settings, you can revoke the access of third-party applications that you previously connected to your Fitbit account.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, which link will you click? Perhaps all four? Will you do it and then go back to the text (there's still plenty of it), or will you get lost in the first set of preferences, curse and look for the &quot;I agree&quot; button? This is what I'd call obfuscation through confusion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook, by the way, has a big blue button for consent, but a mere hyperlink for deleting your account if you disagree with the new rules -- even though deletion is the more momentous decision. We all know the trick that sends us looking frantically for the &quot;X&quot; we need to click to close an ad. The way Facebook has laid out its new policy pages is a subtler version of that intentional annoyance, a form of mild psychological pressure to sign on the dotted line and be done with it. Most people will There's no way to reject specific parts of the rules except indirectly, through tweaking certain settings, and then not in every case -- even though very little data collection is actually required to provide the basic Facebook service. That's unfair to users whose data are coming to Facebook from a multitude of hard-to-track sources, some of which they'd surely like to cut off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Twitter's updated privacy policy runs to more than 8,800 words, and it's distinct from its Terms of Service and Twitter Rules. I know some people -- lawyers and reporters -- capable of getting through all three documents with a magnifying glass, but most users aren't like that. There's no reason for the multiple documents and the verbosity except to induce boredom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GDPR rules aren't complicated. They mainly require organizations that collect and process data to ask internet users in clear language whether they're OK with it. But what users get is, as ever, a lengthy legal text -- no, three of them and wait, there's also this linked page and that one, and a separate privacy policy for children, and another one for pets (OK, I made that last one up).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a right way to do it. Among all the organizations whose updated policies I've seen in recent days, the unlikeliest one came the closest to it -- London's recently renamed Kiln Theater, which sent a policy change notification to my London-based editor. Its new privacy policy is, of course, another morass of legal verbiage -- but it contains a handy table that lists the purposes for which data are collected and matches them with specific data types used.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's what I want to see from each of the data harvesters who want my personal information. A simple three-column table. First column Purpose of data collection (for example: &quot;To personalize ads&quot; or &quot;To enable academic research&quot;). Second column: Types of data collected or processed (for example: &quot;Web browsing history&quot; or &quot;information about previous purchases provided by advertisers&quot;). Third column: Consent (two checkboxes opposite every data type: &quot;I agree&quot; and &quot;I object&quot;). In cases where the company considers consent obligatory for the service it provides -- and only in those rare cases -- checking the &quot;object&quot; box should result in a pop-up explaining why the company can't live without this and providing a link to the local privacy watchdog's complaint form.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This would be true GDPR compliance -- with the regulation's spirit, not just its letter. But dealing with the consent part in an honest way would only be the first step. Companies then would have to live up to other requirements such as data portability (Facebook, for example, only allows you to download your contacts in text format, so you can't really move your online friendships to another service).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I hope the EU objects to how its regulation is being applied, but somehow I doubt it The lawyers who wrote the new policies know their job. It has little to do with earning trust and everything with minimizing litigation. So whether users feel cheated or not (I do), the new policies tell them that by continuing to use the services past May 25, they consent to the rules as the lawyers rewrote them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a business opportunity waiting for a classic disruptor. Honest GDPR compliance can be marketed. Can anyone get up the courage to do it?</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">983  words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">       Quintarelli, Spiekermann and his fellow ethicists online offer us a practical way for a transparent, fair, democratic and respectful internet of personal rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chris Hughes, co-founder of Facebook, recently noted that Facebook's public scrutiny is &quot;too late,&quot; stating that &quot;it's shocking to me that they have not had to answer more questions previously.&quot; Leaders of the information technology sector, especially in Europe, have warned of the abuse of Facebook (and other portals) for years. Their perceptions and practical recommendations are especially urgent now. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's testimony to the US Senate did little to bolster public confidence in a company that misuses users' personal data. The most revealing moment came when Illinois Senator Richard Durbin asked if Zuckerberg would be comfortable sharing the name of the hotel where he was staying and the people to whom he had sent messages that week, exactly the kind of data tracked and used Through facebook. Zuckerberg replied that he would not feel free to provide the information. &quot;I think it has everything to do with it,&quot; Durbin said. &quot;Your right to privacy.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Facebook critics have been championing this for years. Stefano Quintarelli, one of the leading IT experts in Europe and a leading online privacy advocate (and until recently a member of the Italian Parliament), has been a persistent and prophetic critic of Facebook's abuse of its market position and misuse of personal data online. Quintarelli long ago defended a powerful idea: that each person should maintain control over his online profile, which should be easily transferable through the portals. If we decided that we did not like Facebook, we could switch to a competitor without losing the links to the contacts that remain on Facebook. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For Quintarelli, abuse of Cambridge Analytica data acquired on Facebook was an inevitable consequence of Facebook's irresponsible business model. Facebook now recognizes that Cambridge Analytica was not the only one to have explored personal profiles acquired from Facebook. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In personal communications with me, Quintarelli says that the European Union's General Regulation on Data Protection, which comes into force on 25 May, after six years of preparation and debate, &quot;may serve as a guide in some respects.&quot; According to the GDPR, he notes, &quot;Non-compliant organizations can face heavy fines, up to 4% of their revenues. If GDPR was already in place, Facebook, to avoid such fines, would have to notify authorities about data leakage as soon as he became aware, well before the last US election. &quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Quintarelli emphasizes that &quot;effective competition is a powerful tool to increase and defend biodiversity in the digital space&quot;. And here, GDPR should help because it &quot;introduces the concept of profile portability, with which a user can transfer their profile from one service provider to another, as we do when transferring our phone profile - the mobile phone number - from one operator to another &quot;. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But &quot;this form of ownership of the profile data itself,&quot; Quintarelli continues, &quot;is certainly not enough.&quot; Equally important is &quot;interconnection: the operator to whom we carry our profile must be interconnected to the originator so that we do not lose touch with our online friends.&quot; This is possible today thanks to technologies such as IPFS and Solid, developed by web inventor Tim Berners-Lee. &quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sarah Spiekermann, a professor at the University of Economics and Business in Vienna (WU) andInstitute of Information Management Systems, is another online privacy pioneer who has long warned about the types of abuse seen on Facebook. Spiekermann, a global authority on the use of our online identities for targeted advertising, political propaganda, public and private surveillance or other nefarious purposes, emphasizes the need to crack down on &quot;personal data markets.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Since the World Economic Forum began discussing personal data as a new asset class in 2011,&quot; she told me, &quot;personal data markets thrived on the idea that these could be the 'new oil' of the digital economy and also - as it seems to be true - of politics. &quot; As a result, &quot;more than 1,000 companies are now involved in a digital information value chain that collects data from any online activity and delivers targeted content to users approximately 36 seconds after it enters the digital world.&quot; It's not &quot;just Facebook and Google, Apple, or Amazon that collect and use our data for any purpose imaginable,&quot; says Spiekermann. &quot;Data management platforms, such as those operated by Acxiom or Oracle BlueKai, have thousands of personal attributes and sociopsychological profiles of hundreds of millions of users.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While Spiekermann believes that &quot;personal data markets and the use of data within them should be prohibited in their current form,&quot; she believes that GDPR &quot;is a good motivator for companies around the world to question their sharing practices of personal data &quot;. Spiekermann also points out that &quot;an ecosystem of online privacy services is starting to work.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Facebook's immense lobbying power has so far removed the practical ideas of Quintarelli, Spiekermann and his fellow campaigners. But the recent scandal has alerted the public to the threat posed by inaction to democracy itself. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The EU took the lead in the response, thanks to its new privacy standards, and proposed greater taxation of Facebook and other online personal data sellers. But more needs to be done. Quintarelli, Spiekermann and his fellow ethicists online offer us a practical way for a transparent, fair, democratic and respectful internet of personal rights. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apple's growing place in enterprise IT means you're already seeing more of its logos appear in meetings, conferences, and in the field. What do enterprise CIOs need to understand today as they make decisions for tomorrow?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Complexity sucks</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It doesn't matter how important your business process is, there really is no excuse for fiddly and complex user interfaces, often used features that are nested deep in the innards of the app, or inconsistent software behavior. If your workers are using better computers at home, or better mobile devices, then they will use consumer applications to do the same task no matter how much you warn them about &quot;Grey IT.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Policy is meaningless</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That brings me to my next point: security policy. Again, there's no excuse for overly complex or anti-intuitive security policy outside of a high security business. (Someone at the FBI may expect to follow complex security protocol, but someone at another large firm probably won't.)</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[ Related: 8 ways businesses can take advantage of the iPhone X ]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You see, while the protocols may have been designed to protect company data, the more you forbid employees from doing ordinary tasks they're used to doing more efficiently using their own solutions, the more likely you are to create a scenario in which an employee somehow breaks protocol, something bad happens, and they then don't let you know about the crisis event. Security policy needs to be as friction-free as user interfaces. This doesn't mean you're left insecure - quite the reverse - a security policy people follow to is going to be inherently more secure than one they ignore. Use MDM, containerization, and all the other helpful tools available to help your business secure its data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Technology is meaningless</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It doesn't matter how much reassurance you've been given by the experts you've hired to advise on your digital transformation, nor is it important how many squadrillion dollars you may (or may not) have spent on the tech you think will help drive these new efficiencies. If the eventual solution is too kludgy, inefficient, unreliable, or otherwise full of friction, then your employees will not engage with it. Oh, and don't humiliate them by telling them you are paying them so they have to do as you say because that's when you will discover ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tech is an HR matter</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are used to using technology. I'll repeat that: WE ARE USED TO USING TECHNOLOGY. Most consumers (at least in the most economically developed nations) already use iPhones, Macs, and iPads at home. If you insist on making your employees use solutions they consider second rate, you will see the cost of recruitment and retention rise. How much does it cost to identify and hire someone? How much does it cost to train them? If the tools you force employees to use are less effective than the products they use in their own lives, they won't stick around. This will impact business efficiency, productivity, and staff morale. So, why not look to the top, because ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It starts at the top</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If your C-class executive teams all want to use Apple products, then it's reasonable to assume most of your employees want to use them, too. If your business depends on tech (and all businesses today just about do), then surely it makes sense to ensure your workers have the best available tools? In addition, if you want your employees to start using some new digital processes to get things done, you'd best make sure you're using them, too. If it's not good enough for you, why is it good enough for them?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ignorance is not power</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What platforms are your new employees used to using? How much time and money do you want to squander training them to use something else?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Windows are open</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well, perhaps not entirely, but Microsoft gets that it has lost the mobile wars and understands that the future of computing is more mobile than PC-based. That's why it offers Office 365 (which works almost everywhere) and why it invests so much cash in developing enterprise-class solutions that work in the cloud.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Legacy is legacy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I often hear Enterprise Platform Change Deniers&nbsp;claim that Microsoft still dominates the enterprise, or that Macs/other Apple products just aren't compatible with their existing software infrastructure. To them, I offer an observation: If the software your business relies on is incompatible with Apple products, then there's a reasonably high probability it's also incompatible with other third-party applications, services, and solutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given that the future of business is partly based on effective technology partnerships, then be warned that victory in your industry will more likely go to those of your competitors who figure out how to transition their tech infrastructure to more compatible platforms that are more extensible and more analytical, too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Security and privacy aren't luxury items</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Security doesn't stop with your enterprise software solutions -&nbsp;cloud-based or no. It also depends on the platforms you use. Given that malware attacks are climbing at an astonishing rate, surely it makes sense to migrate systems to platforms that receive regular OS updates that are then quickly applied across the whole ecosystem. Your tech support and security teams will have a much better time if all the tech solutions used across your company are running the most recent OS software and the most recent security patch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The same applies to privacy - you don't want sophisticated criminals to piece together access to your back-end systems through a series of cunning phishing attacks on your employees, particularly if those are made easier by non-existent platform security upgrades being available for their handset or device.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cost is not what it seems</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's not just the cost of the solutions. It's also how much it costs to train people to use them; the cost of support and upgrade; the cost of security; the price of HR, recruitment, and staff retention; the cost consequences of grey IT impacting robust enterprise systems or violating GDPR; the cost of tech support, software licensing and compatibility; international business standards support; and more. Not to mention the usable life of the solutions you put in place. When enterprise CIOs get to upgrade those legacy computing systems, they'd be well-advised to consider the cost consequences of the things that aren't even included in the bill as they reach their decisions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first hurdle is the hardest</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was only a few years ago that Macs in the enterprise were a rarity. That meant enterprises choosing to use Apple's platforms had to figure out all the integration challenges by themselves. That's no longer the case, with oodles of third-party vendors offering a range of services designed to make Apple enterprise integration easier. This should boost enterprise buying confidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What does this mean? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'll put it this way: Enterprise chiefs looking to upgrade their technologies will find it easier than ever to migrate to Apple. I think they probably will.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Google+?&nbsp;If you use social media and happen to be a Google+ user, why not&nbsp;join&nbsp;AppleHolic's Kool Aid Corner community&nbsp;and get involved with the conversation as we pursue the spirit of the New Model Apple?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Got a story? Please&nbsp;drop me a line via Twitter&nbsp;and let me know. I'd like it if you chose to follow me there so I can let you know about new articles I publish and reports I find.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On May 25 2018, the EUGeneral Data Protection Regulationwill go into effect, leaving organizations just over one month to plan, budget and employ the changes needed to meet its guidelines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Enforcement will include steep non-compliance fines, and lest anyone forget, GDPR is not just an EU issue. The guidelines will affect any organization handling personal data of individuals residing in the EU no matter where they are located, meaning even U.S. companies that process the personal data of individuals in the EU will have to comply.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the GDPR doesn't specify many technical details on how to achieve compliance, it can be a challenge for security professionals to prepare their organizations for the new regulations. Additionally, the GDPR introduces a new set of data protection principles that must be followed.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thankfully, many of these data protection requirements can be sustainably and cost-effectively adhered to by leveraging existing tools and processes that are already deployed in a typical organization - and the good news is, your organization might already be more prepared than you might think.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many organizations have already invested in identity governance solutions that provide centralized visibility and govern control over which users have access to what information. By providing a map of which users and roles can access applications and data (both structured and unstructured), this technology can offer organizations the ability to catalog systems, applications and databases (both on-premises and in the cloud), and determine whether appropriate access controls and safeguards are in place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The four key elements you need to look for in a GDPR-ready identity governance solution include comprehensive coverage for applications and data stored in files, compliance controls, automated provisioning and password management. Each one of these plays crucial roles in identifying personal data, securing that data and demonstrating proof of GDPR compliance across an entire organization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Specific areas in which this visibility can help organizations prepare for and meet GDPR requirements include the following:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Personal Data Protection Principles</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The primary objective of the GDPR is privacy and the protection of personal data (Article 5), so organizations will need to demonstrate their compliance in processing, storing and securing personal data. Insight into who has access to what can provide visibility and control of personal data, automating the discovery and classification of personal data, and providing activity monitoring to improve risk mitigation and ensure an understanding of appropriate data use.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Securing Personal Data</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GDPR requires organizations to implement and &quot;design in&quot; appropriate technical and organizational measures for securing personal data (Articles 25 and 32). Centralized visibility into the access control models for all resources storing and processing personal data allows organizations to define and enforce access policies, conduct regular access reviews by data owners, and automatically revoke inappropriate access. To ensure ongoing compliance, this insight can also help to prevent policy violations by evaluating any proposed access changes against defined rules and automatically logging all access requests and actions by approvers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Monitoring and Detection</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to GDPR (Articles 33 and 34), organizations must report data breaches to Data Processing Authorities and in some cases to data subjects. The regulation gives companies 72 hours from the time they become aware of a breach to report it, so organizations need to be prepared to immediately disclose specific details about individuals impacted, the duration of the breach and any remedial actions taken. A comprehensive understanding of where personal data is located and who has access to it can provide automated breach detection via forensics and fine-grained audit trails, notifying data owners and managers to any detected violations or anomalies, automatically remediating when violations are detected, and allowing data owners to perform real-time risk status checks over data they manage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meeting Compliance Documentation Requirements</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GDPR regulations require organizations to maintain an Internal Data Processing Register to document all personal data processing activities (Articles 30 and 35). Organizations must also have in place a process for determining when a Privacy Impact Assessment is required for &quot;high-risk&quot; processing of personal data. These reporting requirements can be streamlined by identifying personal data stored in hard-to-find locations, especially data stored in files, and providing complete visibility into the access control models for each resource storing or processing personal data. The technology can also access and mitigate risk by providing detailed reports of each access review cycle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With cyberattacks becoming more complex and frequent than ever before, organizations must be prepared to mitigate any and all risks. Technology that offers insight into who has access to what can help organizations combat inevitable cyber threats, while also bringing them one step closer to compliance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you start with the core concepts from your current identity governance program and augment them to address the unique challenges of data stored in files, you're well on your way to having full visibility into your organization and being compliant with strict regulations like GDPR.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">law or promise guides</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">data collection policies</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All 2.2 billion people who use Facebook will soon see changes to their privacy settings, in response to a broad new privacy law in Europe - but American users won't see exactly the same thing as their European counterparts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The social network has been under heavy scrutiny for not clearly explaining how it shares, uses and protects data after the Cambridge Analytica debacle, as recent congressional hearings illustrated. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These changes, in the works for months, are supposed to make the why and how of Facebook's data collection clearer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new law, General Data Protection Regulation, takes effect on May 25. The law is complex but has two main data goals: to give people control over what data they hand over to companies and to require companies to be more open about how they use that data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States has no similar law, but a couple of lawmakers at the hearings asked Zuckerberg to commit to giving Americans the same protections as Europeans under the GDPR. He did.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook confirmed that its intention is to extend the spirit of the European standard to all its users. &quot;The GDPR and E.U. consumer law set out specific rules for terms and data policies which we have incorporated for E.U. users,&quot; said Stephen Deadman, Facebook's deputy chief global privacy officer. &quot;We have been clear that we are offering everyone who uses Facebook the same privacy protections, controls and settings, no matter where they live. These updates do not change that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result of the law, Facebook is overhauling the look of three settings and asking users to reevaluate them: facial recognition data, specific profile information such as political affiliation or religious views and data shared with outside companies so that Facebook can serve ads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Facebook is making the changes, those privacy protections don't have the same weight of the law behind them in the United States as they do in Europe. Here, they're backed by Facebook's promise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That difference between the E.U. law and Facebook's agreement for U.S. users manifests itself in a couple of ways. The most notable of these are policies that apply to users 13 to 15 years old. (Technically, no one younger than 13 is supposed to have a full Facebook account, anyway.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the GDPR, parents or guardians have to give their approval before teens of that age can see ads based on their interests on Facebook or its sister network Instagram.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the United States, since there is no comparable GDPR law, Facebook is going to give teens the option not to be served ads based on their interests, but it won't ask for parental consent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other differences are more subtle. Facebook's facial recognition wasn't previously turned on in Europe (or Canada) after regulators questioned whether Facebook was properly getting permission to collect that information. Now all European users will see a new option to flip facial recognition on - both for security reasons such as identifying fake accounts and for Facebook to use the data itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some U.S. users will see this, others won't. Facebook has this option turned on by default in the United States. Americans who've already turned off this feature shouldn't see this screen again; Facebook will simply keep the feature off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, other differences between what Europeans and Americans see is a matter of wording. Facebook's terms of service in Europe contain specific references to parts of the GDPR that don't carry a definition in U.S. law. Europeans will see a screen asking them specifically about GDPR-defined &quot;specially protected personal data,&quot; which includes political affiliation, religious views and romantic interests with advertisers. Meanwhile, Americans will be asked about the same data, but the legal term doesn't mean anything in the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Overall, the design changes will look similar around the world. Facebook is simplifying its settings on Web and mobile, making it easier for people to find the option to download all of their Facebook data or delete their account.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Overall, the GDPR does change some things about how we interact with Facebook - but not as much as a U.S. law would.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No one at Google envied Mark Zuckerberg last week as he was being grilled by Congress. But for years, they certainly coveted the personal data that made Facebook a formidable digital ad player. And the strategies they set to compete have now put Google at risk of being swept up in the  privacy backlash against the world's largest social media company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The House and Senate questioned Zuckerberg for about 10 hours after revelations that data on millions of Facebook users got into the hands of Cambridge Analytica, a consulting firm that worked on President Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign. The hearings centered on the digital information and machinery Facebook built up to serve targeted ads. No company has a bigger business doing that - except Google. When the grilling ended, Democrats and some Republicans called for broad privacy regulation, putting Google on the hot seat next to Zuckerberg.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Google, in every respect, collects more data. Google, in every respect, has a much bigger advertising business,&quot; said David Chavern, president of News Media Alliance, a publisher trade group. Rather than &quot;a Facebook privacy law,&quot; he expects regulation to target the entire industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tech giants see a higher chance of legislation if Democrats win the House of Representatives or even the Senate later this year. At that point, the companies would have to begin haggling to fend off some proposals that would be intolerable, according to a top policy official at a major internet company. One concern is that proposals will require letting users opt out of data collection completely, the person said, describing that as an untouchable foundation of internet business models. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far, Google has suffered fewer of the problems plaguing Facebook, including fake news and Russian-linked political spending. And it's avoided public blunders like the Cambridge Analytica data leak. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But two years ago, Google altered its advertising business in a way that makes it more vulnerable to data-sharing scrutiny. The company rolled out new rules for its DoubleClick system, which targets and places ads across the web. Advertisers could start pairing their own web-tracking data (from &quot;cookies&quot; that follow users online) with potent Google information including search queries, location history, phone numbers and credit card information. Until then, Google had steadfastly kept that personal data separate. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the time, Google said the new approach let marketers more easily track consumers across multiple devices. But two former Google ad executives said Facebook's aggressive ad targeting moves also prompted the decision. They asked not to be named discussing their former employer. Google declined to comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even before that, Google was working to counter Facebook's critical edge: knowing exactly who people are online. In 2015, the search giant unveiled Customer Match, a tool letting advertisers target ads using consumers' Gmail addresses. That mirrored a popular Facebook offering called Custom Audiences. Google Plus, the company's social network, failed to catch on with users but did prompt millions of people to log in to Google's other web properties, catnip for marketers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those changes helped Google's display ad business blossom. Morgan Stanley recently pegged its value at $36 billion. Political advertisers are among those embracing DoubleClick. Last year, the unit touted a case study with i360, a marketing firm affiliated with the conservative power brokers Charles and David Koch. i360 uses its own data to slice online populations into segments, such as those for and against gun control and traditional marriage. A Google blog post explained how DoubleClick's systems sucked in that information to help i360 boost the number of its ads people saw. i360 didn't respond to a request for comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Google stresses its ad targeting is anonymous, with strict privacy controls in place. &quot;More than any tech company out there, Google is taking this extremely seriously,&quot; said Mario Schiappacasse, who runs display advertising for digital marketing firm Jellyfish. &quot;We've always seen them be extremely cautious.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ad industry is also quick to point out that the Cambridge Analytica saga is different than the ad targeting Google offers. And the tracking and data-collection methods used by the largest internet services are disclosed in terms and conditions. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But during Zuckerberg's marathon questioning on Capitol Hill, politicians were either oblivious or unconcerned with the distinction. Sens.  Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat, and John Kennedy, a Republican, introduced consumer privacy legislation last week, writing that tech companies are &quot;profiting off the data of Americans - their online behavior, personal messages, contact and personal information, and more - all while leaving consumers in the dark.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nuances of complex ad technology and voluminous user agreements are lost on most of the public, too. A recent Gallup poll found that 35 percent of Google users are very concerned about invasion of privacy, up from 25 percent in 2011. Facebook users are even more skeptical: 43 percent of the social network's users surveyed cited the same worry. However, the research also showed Google users are slightly more concerned that their personal data will be sold to or used by other companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Google is already buttoning up its data policies in anticipation of Europe's General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which kicks in next month. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Congress is considering a bipartisan bill, the Honest Ads Act, that would require disclosures for online political ads. Facebook endorsed it and Zuckerberg told Congress he was open to additional regulation. Google has not yet endorsed the bill.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DUBLIN -- U.S. lawmakers demonstrated an increased appetite for regulating technology giants when they grilled Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg about privacy. But the future of Facebook's relationship with its 2 billion users is less likely to be determined from the halls of Congress than it is from an unassuming 18th-century townhouse in Ireland's capital packed with lawyers, technology experts and gumshoe investigators. Europe has been moving aggressively to impose order on the tech space. Already, it has inflicted painful penalties on Apple and Google for their business practices. Now, technology companies are readying themselves for sweeping new privacy rules that go into effect next month across the European Union. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They could face billion-dollar fines if they fail to give European users far more control over their personal information. Whether the U.S. Congress follows the European model, as some lawmakers floated this past week, or whether big tech companies determine it's too cumbersome to treat the 500 million people of the E.U. differently from the rest of the world, Europe is likely to keep setting the global pace for aggressive regulation. &quot;As a first mover, that has now become a baseline,&quot; said Dean Garfield, the president of the Information Technology Industry Council, a Washington-based trade group for tech giants such as Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google. Europe &quot;is increasingly setting the norm.&quot; And Europeans have embraced the role. &quot;The E.U. is a real regulatory superpower, and it exports its values and its standards,&quot; said Christopher Kuner, a director of the Brussels Privacy Hub at the Free University of Brussels. At the center of the action is Helen Dixon, Ireland's data protection commissioner. Because the European operations for many big technology companies are headquartered in low-tax Ireland, Dixon is set to become the top cop for U.S. tech giants including Facebook, Google, Apple, LinkedIn and Airbnb when the new privacy regime comes into force on May 25. She will have the power to slap companies with fines of up to 4 percent of global revenue -- which for Facebook could mean penalties of up to $1.6 billion. &quot;Their business model is around monetizing personal data, and this creates very significant challenges in terms of fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals,&quot; Dixon said in an interview in her Dublin townhouse office. &quot;It creates a type of surveillance and tracking of individuals across the internet that undoubtedly needs regulation.&quot; Facebook's latest scandal has been perfectly timed to draw attention to Europe's long-planned privacy rules. On April 4, the company said &quot;malicious actors&quot; had used its search tools to match previously hacked email addresses and phone numbers to Facebook profiles. That follows the company's report that Cambridge Analytica, a data analysis firm hired by President Donald Trump during his 2016 campaign, improperly accessed 87 million Facebook users' names, &quot;likes&quot; and other personal information -- in many cases without their knowledge or consent. The matter has spawned investigations on both sides of the Atlantic. In Europe, Dixon joins an elite rank of enforcers, many of who happen to be women, holding power over the U.S. tech industry. Her partners include Andrea Jelinek, an Austrian data protection regulator expected to lead a new board of E.U. consumer-privacy cops. In the E.U. capital of Brussels, top justice official Vera Jourova has challenged Facebook in recent weeks over the Cambridge Analytica mishap. And then there's Margrethe Vestager, the bloc's competition chief. She thwacked Google with a nearly $3 billion fine and is forcing it to overhaul how it presents sponsored shopping results. She is making Apple pay $16 billion in back taxes to Ireland. Vestager, who was in Washington, D.C., on Friday, has said she is increasingly turning her attention to issues around user data -- a development that has cheered privacy advocates and chilled technology companies that complain they are being singled out for their success. &quot;It has become almost a habit of looking into data issues when we do a merger procedure, antitrust procedures,&quot; Vestager told reporters. &quot;Data is an asset,&quot; she said in a follow-up interview. &quot;You can mine it; you can work it; you can do completely different things.&quot; She said that regulators were treating data as a &quot;completely different creature&quot; than they did five years ago. U.S. state officials have taken cues from her antitrust enforcement strategy. Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley mimicked her investigation into Google, for instance, and has demanded the company give him the same evidence. &quot;People like Josh Hawley don't want European consumers enjoying better protections than Missourians, so when you have this disparity in how the law is being enforced, it puts pressure on every other jurisdiction to say, 'What did we miss?' &quot; said Luther Lowe, the vice president for government relations at Yelp, the reviews website. Yelp has been Google's chief antagonist in the E.U. The United States was caught somewhat flat-footed by the Facebook privacy scandal. Lawmakers have debated whether to enhance the government's ability to investigate and penalize tech giants that misuse consumers' most sensitive information. But Congress has so far failed to pass a single comprehensive privacy law for the digital age, stumbling in no small part because of partisan warfare and the intense, well-funded lobbying efforts from Silicon Valley. Still, lawmakers are clearly intrigued by what Europe is doing. &quot;Would you support legislation to back that general principle: that opt-in, that getting permission, is the standard?&quot; Sen. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., asked Zuckerberg during the first of two days of hearings. &quot;Europeans have passed that as a law. Facebook's going to live with that law beginning on May 25. Would you support that as the law in the United States?&quot; Zuckerberg sought to reassure users in the United States that they will get the same privacy controls as Europeans after the new laws come into effect, although he allowed himself some wiggle room on the specifics. &quot;I think everyone in the world deserves good privacy protection,&quot; Zuckerberg said. &quot;Regardless of whether we implement the exact same regulation, I would guess that it would be somewhat different, because we have somewhat different sensibilities in the U.S. as to other countries.&quot; For their part, European policymakers have relished their trendsetting status. &quot;The U.S. public right now is realizing that maybe the Europeans have done something that is in their own interest,&quot; said Jan Philipp Albrecht, a German member of European Parliament who played a leading role in drafting the privacy regulation. Now technology companies are bracing for the privacy rules to kick in. In Ireland, the new powers will be a big change for a regulator who until recently was dinged for a lax approach to big technology companies. Some critics say Irish officials were holding their punches because of the country's tech-dependent economic growth. &quot;I'm not sure how much there's influence in it, how much there's politics in it and how much general consensus there is in Ireland in not regulating the big U.S. giants,&quot; said Max Schrems, an Austrian privacy advocate who scored repeated legal victories against Dixon's predecessor. People who have watched Dixon work say her style can be conciliatory rather than confrontational. Critics say her office has not always been aggressive about defending citizens' rights. &quot;You have a culture within the institution which relies on a limited use of statutory enforcement mechanisms and more on persuasion,&quot; said T.J. McIntyre, a law professor who is the chairman of Digital Rights Ireland, a group that has challenged how the Irish government retains information about its citizens. But observers say Dixon's beefed-up resources and enforcement powers are likely to give her new ammunition as she pushes companies to fall in line. Just four years ago, Ireland's data protection office was a backwater, with 25 employees housed above a convenience store outside Dublin. When Dixon took the reins in late 2014, she fought for more funding, quadrupled her staff and moved into the capital. The Georgian townhouse is a brisk walk away from the glassy new tech district that has sprung up around a once-scruffy dock area. Dixon plans to hire another 40 staffers this year. &quot;I don't think the data protection authority was sufficiently staffed at the point where I came on board,&quot; Dixon said. &quot;I think it has been rectified.&quot; Still, enforcement may require a fight: Both Google and Apple have appealed Vestager's judgments against them. The new E.U. rules, known as the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, will give individuals far more control over their personal data. Companies will have to spell out what they will use data for and give users clear choices about whether to agree. Individuals would be able to force companies to return data to them if they wanted to leave a service. Vestager, the competition chief, said the aim is to ensure web users &quot;feel they are somewhat in control&quot; of their data. She mentioned Facebook's recent troubles with Cambridge Analytica. &quot;I think the situation is quite good, because very often when something happens that sort of turns people's attention to an issue, you say, 'Oh. It's brand new. We have to regulate,'&quot; she said. In this case, she said, Europe already has a legal framework that &quot;actually, for real, allows the individual to enforce their rights.&quot; --- Romm reported from Washington.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Bloomberg View) -- Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg and Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg have apologized (again and again) for the company's handling of user data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The best indication that they aren't actually sorry, however, is the social network's intention to change its terms of service to put all non-European users under the jurisdiction of its U.S. headquarters rather than the international headquarters in Dublin, Ireland. That means users in Africa, Asia, Australasia, and Latin America won't be covered by the European Union's General Data Protection Directive, which goes into effect on May 25. The U.K. may also get a carve-out after Brexit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook's admission of the planned change comes immediately after the company effectively promised to apply GDPR protections to the entire world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today we're introducing new privacy experiences for everyone on Facebook as part of the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), including updates to our terms and data policy,&quot; the company wrote in a blog post on Wednesday. &quot;Everyone - no matter where they live - will be asked to review important information about how Facebook uses data and make choices about their privacy on Facebook.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But once non-European users' agreements are no longer with Facebook Ireland, now responsible for all of the company's activities outside North America, they won't be able to hold the company legally responsible for GDPR violations. In effect, they'll be subject to toothless U.S. privacy laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the GDPR, companies can be fined up to 4 percent of their annual global revenue for not having sufficient customer consent to process data or ignoring the &quot;privacy by design&quot; principle that states customers' privacy rights must be handled as a core feature of the product, not an afterthought.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Facebook's case, that's $1.6 billion based on 2017 revenue. It's natural for the company to try to limit its exposure to that kind of punishment, but it undermines its narrative of contrition and a commitment to privacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's worth taking stock of what the GDPR requires. Perhaps most importantly, the regulation demands a granular approach to asking for consent to process personal data. Consent must be received for each separate data collection practice, explicitly, in clear and plain language. Consent must also be &quot;as easy to withdraw as to give,&quot; and the use of the service shouldn't be conditional on a customer's consent to the collection of personal data that is not directly necessary for the service itself, not just for its monetization as in Facebook's case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On all these points, Facebook currently fails. The &quot;Privacy Settings and Tools&quot; section of a user's profile doesn't ask for consent to any kind of data collection. Nor does the Data Policy contain any links to consent forms for particular types of data harvesting. Some of these forms are hidden in the &quot;Ads&quot; section of the profile, where most people wouldn't look for them, and even there, I'm not asked directly to agree to give up my data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, Facebook informs me that I've been accurately placed in the advertising category &quot;Returned from travels 1 week ago&quot; -- but I have no idea how it knows that, since I haven't posted anything on Facebook from my most recent trips nor explicitly agreed anywhere to provide that information to advertisers. I may have clicked to approve some long, incomprehensible legal document at some point to give Facebook access to my location data, but that won't wash in Europe starting May 25. All I can do about it now is delete the ad category, but that won't stop Facebook from continuing to collect the information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In its most recent post, Facebook uses elliptical language to promise to ask users whether they want to let it &quot;use data from partners&quot; to target advertising. If it took GDPR seriously, it would use plainer language: &quot;For years, we have been collecting data about your browsing and app use outside Facebook. We use the data to place you in categories advertisers can select when buying our ads. May we continue or would you like us to stop?&quot; That would comply with the clarity requirement and with the GDPR provision that users can object at any time to the the use of their data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, as Facebook knows, only the most carefree user will give it the right to a blanket surveillance of digital activities. Facebook doesn't want a refusal, one reason the personal data file Facebook allows us to download doesn't actually include web logs -- just the &quot;ad interests&quot; derived from them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zuckerberg had to correct the record on that in his congressional testimony after stating several times that the file contained all the information Facebook possessed about a user. That's not strictly in compliance with the GDPR, which requires the disclosure of data as provided by the user.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GDPR gives users a right to have their information erased if consent for its collection is withdrawn. As an ordinary user, I have no idea how I can do that using Facebook's interface. In late March, Facebook promised to fix this (&quot;It's time to make our privacy tools easier to find,&quot; the company wrote, as if there was also a time to make them difficult to find). But no changes have been rolled out yet. Facebook's intention to move most of its users out of the EU jurisdiction shows full compliance with the GDPR is not desirable, so the changes most of its users will see will probably not be 100 percent GDPR-compliant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's a big mistake in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, which raised the public awareness of Facebook's problems with personal data handling. Pivotal Research Group analyst Brian Wieser, a long-time Facebook bear, wrote in a note released on Thursday that brand marketers will scrutinize their advertising investment in Facebook more carefully, with a skeptical eye on Facebook's claims of precise targeting, now that it's in doubt that users provide much of the data knowingly and willingly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To quote Facebook itself, &quot;it's time&quot; for the company to come clean about the data it has collected for which it doesn't have user consent under the GDPR, and to start systematically informing advertisers and investors about the number of users who have refused to provide such data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far, Facebook hasn't even provided accurate information about the number of fake accounts in its user base. The Pivotal Research note, for example, asserts that there were 287.4 million false and duplicate accounts among Facebook's reported 2.1 billion users. In 2017, according to the note, the reported user base grew by 269 million accounts, but 142 million of them -- almost 53 percent -- were fakes and duplicates. Add all the people who will opt out of providing data when (if ever) they are asked clearly about it, and Facebook's ability to sell targeted ads may be severely impaired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Facebook actually complies with the GDPR, its business performance in Europe will be an indicator of how the whole company can perform if required to stop misleading users and customers about practices central to its business model.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GDPR, the much-discussed General Data Privacy Regulation from the European Union, will not be a cure-all for the world's data privacy problems simply because the GDPR, like every law, is subject to the bureaucracy out of which it was born.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This bureaucracy can be compared to a super tanker and those who would violate the law to speedboats. While the super tanker takes miles to make a simple course adjustment, speed boats can dance around the super tank with little fear of a collision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sure, there will be times when a speedboat captain makes a mistake and collides with the super tanker resulting in the organization being penalized, but my current expectation is that the organizations that will ultimately pay the potential fine of 4 percent of global turnover will be few and far between.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I say this because the GDPR, for all its good intentions, was created by humans, and lawyers will quickly find the loopholes, unintentionally created by the humans, to keep their customers from paying significant fines. Moreover, I simply do not believe that many of the organizations charged with enforcing the GDPR currently have the required manpower and skills to successfully enforce the law. Add to this the fact that Working Party 29 continues to provide guidance on what different sections of the law mean and, at least in the short term, we have a construct that may be difficult to enforce.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That said, I think theGDPRcould have a very positive effect on the events we have recently seen involving Facebook, Cambridge Analytica and the political decisions they are claimed to have influenced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GDPR clearly lays out individual's rights and a primary focus of data privacy and information security professionals should be training colleagues, family, and friends about those rights under this law and the threats that attempt to undermine their rights. The key to success is education, for it is only education that can fix stupid. We, the world, must add critical thinking to educational programs at all levels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An educated population, with solid critical thinking skills, will significantly improve our ability to reduce the effectiveness of fake news and to take back our democracies from the forces that would use our data and opinions against us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite these observations, don't despair. GDPR is a well-intended regulation that has the potential to change the way the world views data privacy. This value will be derived, however, through education rather than through fines. We must all understand that we do not have to accept our employers, governments or, perhaps worst of all, non-governmental organizations that attempt to sway public opinion on crucial political decisions, misusing our data. We have options.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We can inform ourselves using multiple accredited sources. We must demand that our rights are respected. We should confront those who spread fake news, both in the internet but also at our own dinner table. Most importantly, we can vote, with a few mouse clicks, and can close our accounts on those social media platforms which exploit our data for their gain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We must all understand that data privacy is a universal right and thinking critically about what those with access to our data will do with it is the ultimate safeguard for our data, our privacy and ultimately for our democracies.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That doesn't appear to be the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Facebook has changed its terms of service, which means 1.5 billion of its more than 2 billion users will not be protected under the General Data Protection Regulation  that's scheduled to take effect May 25. While Facebook users outside the United States and Canada are currently protected by terms of service with the company's international headquarters in Ireland, Facebook has confirmed it will change that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Reuters, which first reported the change, notes that this means most of Facebook users won't be able to file a complaint in Irish courts, but will instead be subject to less stringent U.S. privacy laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last week during a hearing before the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Zuckerberg, in response to a question from Rep. Gene Green, D-Texas, said, &quot;We believe that everyone around the world deserves good privacy controls. ... The GDPR requires us to do a few more things, and we're going to extend that to the world.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The GDPR, approved by European lawmakers in 2016, will require companies to ask customers for permission to use their data, delete customer data when asked, inform customers about breaches in a timely manner and more. The new law will also require data portability. Violating the new rules will result in fines, and other U.S. tech companies are making changes to prepare to comply with GDPR.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">       The impact of regulation has more than quintupled in the last five years, being more visible after the period of financial crisis. And this regulatory pressure is expected to continue over the next five years in the insurance industry.  The intensity of regulation that covers the insurance industry and the financial system is &quot;probably the new norm, not only in the financial sectors, but also in other sectors,&quot; says Jorge Lima. The last ten years have been marked for the insurance sector with the implementation of the insurance contract regime, the deep review of the legal regime of the insurance business under Solvency II and, soon, the new regime of insurance distribution. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If we consider specific and distribution regulation, the impact of regulation has more than quintupled the past five years, being more visible after the period of European and world financial crisis,&quot; says Jo&atilde;o Lapa Pereira. In addition, the GDPR (Data Protection) Regulation, the Standardization of Pensions (PEPP) or the IFRS17, which &quot;will pose challenges with a high impact over the next five years in the insurance area&quot;. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The intensity of regulation covering the insurance industry and the financial system is likely to </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the new normal, not only in the financial sectors but also in other sectors. Jorge Lima </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chief Risk Officer &amp; Compliance Officer at Generali </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We continue with a high burden of regulatory changes to possible harmonization with US GAAP,&quot; says Marta Alarc&atilde;o Troni. For whom the major changes are in the distribution directives (IDD) and IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts-New Financial Reporting Standard and IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, which enter into force on January 1, 2021. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This legislative revision entails a thorough review of the associated regulatory framework, which leads Nuno Lu&iacute;s Sapateiro to a different conclusion and considers &quot;that the next step will have to be stabilization.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">The problem of complexity</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Issues such as money laundering, terrorist financing or protection of privacy will remain on the agenda and with strong regulatory pressure. Others are demanding regulation, and they are also as business opportunity. These include protection of the environment, advances in biotechnology and genetics, and technological innovation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jorge Lima believes that the &quot;response of the authorities to globalization, technological change and the behavior of economic agents has been to regulate more and to hold these agents more accountable&quot;. But in his view the complexity may not give more protection because &quot;it is more difficult to enforce regulatory requirements and control enforcement.&quot; On the other hand, &quot;complexity is rarely allied with transparency&quot;. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This change, as pointed out by Nuno Lu&iacute;s Sapateiro, &quot;has forced the insurance sector to strengthen the human resources dedicated to the areas of risk management, internal auditing, acting, compliance, etc. with the resulting financial effort.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7"> The future in accounting </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The application of IFRS 17 changes the form of the financial statements and the valuation methods applied by the insurers. &quot;The most important points have to do with valuing the company's responsibilities and with the timing of recognizing the profitability of insurance contracts. If we hope that, over the years, a policy will have an amount of premiums and claims, it is the valuecurrent net of the difference between the two that will have to be accounted for in our balance sheet over the years in which the policy lasts. This totally changes the way you evaluate an insurer's profit. Roughly, it's like saying that the value of your salary is what you have left over after spending the month, &quot;says Jorge Lima. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The impacts of IFRS 17 will be significant and its implementation complex,&quot; says Jo&atilde;o Lapa Pereira. It goes from the current retrospective concept of operations to a concept that takes into account future positive and negative cash flows (premiums, indemnities and expenses) associated with insurance contracts (prospective concept). With this accounting standard will be &quot;possible the recognition of the future profit associated with the risks in portfolio, information naturally valuable for shareholders, investors and customers.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In addition to the change in the way in which the financial statements of insurance companies are accounted for, according to Marta Alarc&atilde;o Troni, IFRS 17 &quot;will have a significant impact on the data, systems and processes used.&quot; </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the deadline now only one month away, and the threat of massive fines of up to 4 percent of global annual revenue, companies have a lot on the line when it comes to General Data Protection Regulation compliance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet, according to a recent study out ofForrester, an estimated 80 percent of organizations are expected to be unable to comply even by the end of 2018.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Becoming GDPR compliant begins with understanding where data lives throughout your organization. For many companies, increasing volumes of data quickly become unorganized and extremely complex, creating a massive challenge right out of the gate. In fact, a recent study fromCompuwarefound that companies consider data quality and data complexity to be the greatest obstacles to compliance.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Enterprise architecture (EA) is one solution for better identifying, structuring and protecting data, and in four steps, can be a secret weapon for ensuring compliance success.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Step 1: Build your stakeholder team</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the GDPR, many organizations will be required to appoint a data protection officer (DPO). While this person is the primary stakeholder responsible for ensuring compliance, compliance can't - and shouldn't - rest on the shoulders of just one individual.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before you dig into your data, stakeholders from every department or division where customer data lives or is used - from sales to marketing to legal - should be assigned and work in alignment with the appointed DPO. With the role well-positioned to identify potential technology risks for compliance breaches, and the data protection impact assessment which must be performed before a new technology is deployed, enterprise architects can serve as a valuable GDPR liaison, ensuring full alignment across all stakeholders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Step 2: Organize your data landscape</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the complexity of modern IT services and the increasing amount of data obtained by companies today, it's not uncommon to lose visibility into everywhere information exists -- and for data to float to unexpected areas -- especially within large organizations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first step towards achieving full compliance is establishing a clear view of your data -- where it lives, how your company processes it and how to quickly access it to make key changes. While a daunting and time-consuming task, leveraging EA and application portfolio management (APM) tools can help you gain full visibility into your organization's data landscape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regardless of your existing EA sophistication, taking an application-centered approach will create a strong foundation for success.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First, identify all existing applications inside of the organization. Use surveys of application owners to uncover which applications involve personal data as defined by the GDPR, ensure that consent has been received by all data subjects and identify all business capabilities that use the impacted applications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the help of an APM tool, you can easily assign ownership for both the applications and the processing of the associated data, link GDPR documents such as records of processing activities, and tag each data object or application according to level of privacy sensitivity. The ultimate goal should be on creating a data economy, minimizing the amount of user data, consolidating where it lives and minimizing the number of users that have access to it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Step 3: Detect and assess risks</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Without the right risk protocol in place, the GDPR can leave you vulnerable to failure. For example, the right to be forgotten includes giving individuals the power to completely revoke or delete their data from the possession of your organization -- a major challenge if you lack visibility into the applications where that personal data lives, or if the data has been duplicated across multiple areas of the business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Automated visualizations and data flow models can quickly show you which data objects are used by which applications, which business capabilities depend on them, and the critical consequences to the company in the event of an application failure, hacking attack, or data breach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With a snapshot of your application landscape, you can then assess risk. Risk level can be determined through risk assessment surveys, and be based on varying factors, including business impact, application dependencies, criticality levels, failure scenarios and previous incidents. The more dependencies an application has and the higher the level of connectivity, for example, the higher the level of risk in the event of a failure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once risk levels have been assessed, identify potential gaps and address varying failure scenarios, starting with the highest risk areas that process sensitive data.</SPAN></P>

<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What are the possible consequences?&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The creation of heat maps or risk dependency maps can help you gain an overview of your company's risk portfolio, and thus serve as important decision-makers as a first basis for risk management and control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Step 4: Implement checks and balances and demonstrate compliance</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once you've assessed the technology risks, implement concrete security checks and preventative measures. When it comes to ongoing security and compliance, it's critical to ask not only how well your application portfolio meets security standards today, but how your security standards will develop over time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Findings from risk assessment surveys can be used as a starting point for defining useful security checks and appropriate measures. For example, if it was uncovered that customer data collected by your content management system was transferred to a mailing tool or CRM system, leaving no demonstrable consent from the addresses, a double opt-in process can be implemented as a preventative measure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By creating a scalable and repeatable process for uncovering vulnerabilities and systematically following up on their correction, you can ensure all deficits in your IT landscape are addressed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Documenting the chosen process for how personal data is processed, how risks are handled and the measures that have been implemented to limit risk will allow you to successfully demonstrate GDPR compliance, particularly when conducting a DPIA, which is required for every implementation of a new system that uses personal data. Inventory snapshots - including a clear overview of all applications, interfaces, data objects and technologies - can serve as a key tool for regularly reviewing and presenting compliance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GDPR compliance will continue to be one of the largest IT challenges - in the run-up to the May deadline and beyond.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Trump was slated to attend theSummit of the Americas in Peru, which would have been his first official visit to Latin America. He canceled at the last minute, citing the conflict with Syria.Vice President Mike Pence took Trump's place at the summit (ABCNews, &quot;Vice President Pence departs for South America trip in Trump's place,&quot; 04.13.2018).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified beforeCongress on April 10 and 11 on the website's misuse of user data and complicity inRussian election meddling. The two days of hearings before the Senate and House came in light of theCambridge Analytica scandal, in which Facebook allowed the political consulting firm, which worked with Trump, access to the data of millions of its users. Zuckerberg's testimony, in which he confessed he made a mistake, increased Facebook's share price by 5.7 percent (The New York Times, &quot;2 Days, 10 Hours, 600 Questions: What Happened When Mark Zuckerberg Went to Washington,&quot; 04.12.2018).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trump on April 12 asked his trade and economic advisors to examine options for rejoining theTrans-Pacific Partnership . This decision comes one year after the United States withdrew from the TPP and as the trade war withChina intensifies. Trump tweeted that he would consider re-joining the TPP if he would get a better deal thanPresident Obama. Trump has previously said of the deal, &quot;The Trans-Pacific Partnership is another disaster done and pushed by special interests who want to rape our country, just a continuing rape of our country.&quot; The current members of the TPP would expect significant concessions from the United States if it were to rejoin the trade agreement (The New York Times, &quot;Trump Weighs Return to Trans-Pacific Partnership. Not So Fast, Say Members,&quot; 04.13.2018).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former FBI Director James Comey published a memoir on Tuesday, April 17. Titled &quot;A Higher Loyalty,&quot; the book comparesTrump to a mob boss and characterizes him as unethical. Comey was dismissed at the beginning of May 2017 while eading an investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. The official reason for his dismissal was mishandling the investigation intoHillary Clinton's emails. Trump responded to the new book by calling Comey an &quot;untruthful slime ball,&quot; while theRepublican National Committee launched a website called &quot;Lyin' Comey&quot; in an attempt to discredit him (CNNPolitics, &quot;Exclusive: Inside the GOP plan to discredit Comey,&quot; 04.12.2018).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The FBI raided the office and the hotel room of Trump's longtime personal lawyerMichael Cohen on April 9. Searching for details and proof that Cohen blocked negative information about Trump during his campaign, they took documents connected to payments to former adult film starStormy Daniels as well as his business records, emails, phones and a laptop. The raid was personally approved byDeputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein after the official recommendation fromSpecial Counsel Robert Mueller. Trump has called the raid a witch hunt (CNN, &quot;FBI raids Trump lawyer Michael Cohen's office,&quot; 04.09.2018).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GOP fundraiser Elliott Broidy resigned from the RNC due to reports that he agreed to pay a $1.6 million settlement to a former Playboy model who said she was pregnant with Broidy's baby. The deal was arranged byCohen (The Wall Street Journal, &quot;Elliott Broidy Quits RNC Post After Report on Payment to Ex-Model,&quot; 04.13.2018).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Senate Judiciary Committee will vote on a bipartisan bill protectingMueller from being fired byTrump. The bill will allow Mueller to challenge a dismissal in court up to 10 days after termination (Politico, &quot;Bipartisan Senate bill to protect Mueller set to advance,&quot; 04.11.2018).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaker of the House Paul Ryan (R-WI) has announced that he will not run for re-election in the 2018 midterms. As many as43 Republicans in the House so far have announced they are leaving office. The high number is a result of disagreements withTrump, as well as several allegations of sexual harassment (CNN Politics, &quot;There is a wave of Republicans leaving Congress, updated again,&quot; 04.11.2018).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Around the world...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In May, a strict new law on the regulation and protection of personal data will come into force in theEuropean Union. Known as the General Data Protection Regulation , the law will overhaul how businesses and the public sector process and handle their customer data. This is one of the biggest changes in online privacy legislation &nbsp;to date. During his hearing before the House Committee,Zuckerberg committed to the GDPR as a global standard for Facebook, promising that Americans and users worldwide will receive the same protections as Europeans under the GDPR (The New York Times, &quot;A Tough Task for Facebook: European-Type Privacy for All,&quot; 04.08.2018; Euronews, &quot;New EU digital law will 'protect personal data,'&quot; 04.10.2018).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hungary's right-wing prime minister Viktor Orb&aacute;n won his third mandate on April 8, while his partyFidesz won two-thirds of the parliamentary seats in the recent elections. Orb&aacute;n campaigned on an anti-immigration platform and opposes increasing the powers of theEuropean Union. On Saturday, April 14, around 100,000 people attended an anti-Orb&aacute;n protest in Budapest. Many of the protesters were young people, who called the electoral system unfair and demanded a recount of the ballots (The Economist, &quot;Hungary's prime minister, Viktor Orb&aacute;n, wins another landslide,&quot; 04.12.2018).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least 257 people were killed in anAlgerian military plane crash outside the capital of Algiers on April 11. This represents the deadliest plane accident in Algeria's history (BBC, &quot;Algeria military plane crash: 257 dead near Algiers,&quot; 04.11.2018).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Russian stock markets took a hit on April 9 with stocks falling almost nine percent, while the ruble dropped 2.5 percent against the dollar. The fall came amidTrump's criticism of Russian support for theSyrian government. The drop was mostly a result of the latest round of America's sanctions againstRussia. The sanctions targeted seven Russian oligarchs and 12 companies under their control (Financial Times, &quot;Russian stocks tumble 9 percent on US sanctions worries,&quot; 04.09.2018).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Keeping up with 2020 hopefuls...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last weekend,Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti visited Iowa, where he suggested Iowa and Los Angeles are very similar, saying, &quot;We have the same hopes right now, and we have the same challenges before us.&quot; Some Democrats have mentioned him as a potential 2020 contender, withChair of the Polk County Democrats Sean Bagniewski saying, &quot;He's got some of the Obama buzz that we've been hearing about-somebody who is coming out of nowhere, but is dynamic, has a great American story, and has the ability to cross [voter lines]&quot; (CNN Politics, &quot;LA and Iowa have 'a ton in common,' LA's mayor Garcetti tells Iowa voters,&quot; 04.16.2018).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garcetti is not the only major who might potentially be interested in the 2020 presidential elections. Other mayors who may be running includeNew York Mayor Bill De Blasio; South Bend, IN Mayor Pete Buttigieg and formerSan Antonio Mayor Julian Castro, who served as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development underObama (The New York Times, &quot;Will Democrats Find a Presidential Hopeful at City Hall?,&quot; 04.13.2018).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mexico, 18 Apr (Notimex). - The social network Facebook today announced new new privacy measures, which seek to comply with the General Regulation of Data Protection (GDPR, for its acronym in English) of the European Union. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Everyone, regardless of where they live, will be asked to review important information about how Facebook uses the data and make decisions about their privacy.&quot; We will begin publishing these options in Europe this week, &quot;he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In his blog he said he will ask users to make decisions about ads based on partner data; In addition, if the user chose to share political, religious and relationship information in their profile, they will request that they choose if they want to continue sharing and let them use this information. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He added that he will also ask people to accept the updated data service and policy terms, which include more details in response to questions about how their services work. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We do not request new rights to collect, use or share your data on Facebook, and we remain committed to not selling information about you to advertisers or other partners,&quot; he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While the content of the data policy is the same worldwide, people in the European Union will see specific details relevant only to the people who live there, such as how to contact the Data Protection Officer under GDPR, he added. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The social network also indicated that it updated its Activity Register on mobile devices, so that people can see the information they shared with Facebook from their mobile devices. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It has also created many special protections for teens and this year it presents a new global online resource center specifically for them, and more information about their most common privacy questions. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In some countries of the European Union, people between 13 and 15 years old need permission from a parent or guardian for some Facebook functions, so they will see a less personalized version of the social network, with restricted sharing and less relevant ads, until that they obtain permission to use all aspects. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">       Facebook is introducing new privacy features in accordance with the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation, including updates to terms and data policy. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The company said it will extend new privacy protections to all users, even to users outside the EU. The new features will begin rolling out in Europe this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Facebook's latest move to improve its privacy follows Facebook's revelations that data from 87 million users was accessed by political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica, which is linked to US President Donald Trump's election campaign, without their permission. The millions of users' &quot;psychographic profiles&quot; were used to manipulate them with ads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Facebook has recently updated its data policy, while CEO Mark Zuckerberg issued an apology and testified before Congress as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;As soon as GDPR was finalized, we realized it was an opportunity to invest even more heavily in privacy. We not only want to comply with the law, but also go beyond our obligations to build new and improved privacy experiences for everyone on Facebook,&quot; the company said in a blog post.        </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Facebook is in the hot seat for failing to safeguard data privacy, the European Union is about to take a giant step forward to protect personal data. The EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), adopted two years ago, will go into effect on May 25, and the implications are large for companies that handle data belonging to Europeans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This includes SaaS providers looking to develop and deploy apps that work with data across international boundaries. It also impacts healthcare organizations collaborating with countries in Europe to speed research and development of healthcare solutions.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Key provisionsThe GDPR takes a broad view of what constitutes personal identification information. Organizations that must comply with GDPR will need the same level of protection for an individual's IP address and cookie data as for their name, address and medical ID number. Companies can hold and process only the minimum amount of data needed to achieve their objectives, only for as long as necessary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The data at rest must be encrypted or tokenized to prevent security breaches. If such a breach occurs, the data-controlling company must notify the authorities in the country where the breach occurred within 72 hours. Personal data cannot be transferred to countries outside the Eurozone unless those nations guarantee the same level of data protection as the GDPR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Noncompliance with the GDPR can result in a fine of as much as 4 percent of a company's annual global revenue or 20 million euros, whichever is greater. This penalty can be incurred if a company doesn't obtain sufficient consent from individuals to process their data or doesn't build privacy into their business processes. Organizations can be fined 2 percent for not having their records in order or failing to report a security breach. Companies that control data and those they hire to process it-including cloud providers-have liability for noncompliance and security breaches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a PwC survey, 77 percent of U.S. companies with 500 or more employees that do business in Europe expect to spend $1 million or more to meet GDPR requirements. Some 54 percent of these firms said GDPR readiness was their top security/privacy priority. But 23 percent of them hadn't started preparing for the GDPR. It is estimated that about half of U.S. companies won't comply with all GDPR criteria by May 25.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To meet GDPR requirements, U.S. companies with European operations will have to change the way they process, store and protect customers' personal data. If they use cloud services, they will have to develop comprehensive data locality plans with the help of security, privacy and compliance experts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consumer requirementsCompanies will also have to create new processes to meet GDPR's consumer requirements. Asking patients to consent to the processing of their data, for example, requires a very different approach than an opt-out procedure. Similarly, companies will have to track the location of each individual's data and how it has been used to respond to patient requests about the use and processing of their healthcare data. All of this must be designed into the system so that it can be performed automatically and checked regularly for GDPR compliance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, contracts with cloud providers, SaaS vendors, payroll service providers and other business partners may have to be rewritten to protect the data-controlling company. This is similar to what happened in the U.S. in 2010, when the HIPAA Security Rule required HIPAA-covered entities to take responsibility for the actions of their business partners. As with HIPAA, it is incumbent upon the data-controlling company to ensure that these third parties are compliant with the GDPR. This means that companies must understand how their vendors operate and what their security procedures are.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All in all, data companies have a daunting challenge ahead of them as they grapple with the GDPR.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is Apple the shining knight when it comes to privacy collection, as it wants us to believe?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A different business model than Facebook and Google gives it some ground to claim a tighter fortress around your data. But that's not the whole story, and some changes are coming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the wake of the disclosure that nearly 90 million Facebook users' information were passed on to political ad targeting firm Cambridge Analytica without their consent, tech companies are on the defensive.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consumers and lawmakers want to know how much their favorite apps have collected of their choices and movements and what they do with this personal information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apple has made a point of trying to differentiate its approach to consumers' information. On its website, it notes that it collects less data about us than the other big tech companies and then bumps up the security by scrambling it so it doesn't identify who it comes from. Additionally, it says it keeps most of the data on our devices, as opposed to Apple servers, and it's encrypted on those devices and only accessible via your passcode.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And it says it will make it easier to track the information the company collects about us, and to download or delete it, later this year. Currently, getting the data back from Apple is cumbersome and slow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new tools are to comply with new privacy rules, called General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), that go into effect in the European Union in late May. In a nutshell, the rules look to give the user more controls over how their data is used.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Major tech companies are all beefing up their privacy stance to deal with these new rules and consumer blowout over the Facebook data scandal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apple's approach</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So how is Apple different? The iPhone and Macbook maker can make some claims to privacy that stem from a hardware-, not advertising-, based business model. It sells products to us, primarily hardware such as phones, computers, watches and tablets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Remember that with Facebook and Google, we are the engines that enable the companies to sell advertising. When we like a post, check in to a restaurant, ask for directions to a business or search for a hotel to visit, Facebook and Google learn more about us, and coupled with our demographic and location information, can help advertisers to reach us -- making the two companies the juggernauts of digital advertising.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apple insists it &quot;doesn't gather your personal information to sell to advertisers or other organizations.&quot; Such a statement only goes so far -- Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg makes a point of saying Facebook doesn't sell users' data to advertisers, either. What the social network sells is advertisers' access to users, who brands can target with all the information it has gleaned from their activity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for Apple, our always-on iPhones gather up a lot of information, too. When we turn on our phones, the GPS knows where we are, what we do and where we go. When we ask Siri for directions or a recipe, Apple takes note. But Apple says it doesn't share that info with outside companies. It does, however, allow advertisers to target users based on their history in the App Store and News app.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The iPhone maker tries to differentiate itself further. Unlike Facebook and Google, Apple says it scrambles this information and looks at patterns of usage, not at who it's coming from.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apple says that once scrambled, it combines it with the data of millions of others. &quot;So we see general patterns, rather than specifics that could be traced back to you. These patterns help us identify things like the most popular emoji, the best QuickType suggestions and energy consumption rates in Safari,&quot; the company says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company does admit that it freely collects information about what music we listen to, what movies, books and apps we download, which is &quot;aggregated&quot; and used to help Apple make recommendations. Apple says it doesn't share this information with outside companies, either.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you want to see your data ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As we discovered when we downloaded our data directly back from Facebook and Google, the social network had made copies of every photo I'd ever posted and held onto phone numbers, addresses and names of my friends. Google had kept copies of every search made, including ones conducted in &quot;Incognito&quot; mode, which is advertised as private searching.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What Apple won't do, at least for now, is make it easy for you to get your data so you can check out what exactly Apple has held onto. Facebook and Google offer this service, through a download request that can take a few hours to generate. Then you get an email link to download it yourself and get shocked at just how much the social network and search giant has held onto.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apple hides the data request deep inside the privacy section of the website. To get there, it's four clicks from the main page and buried in the 11th subhead on the page.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(I put in the data request Monday just after 11 a.m. Some 22 hours later Tuesday, we heard back from Apple, saying we could get the report once we replied with our full name, Apple ID, email address, street address, phone number and serial number of an Apple product.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gee, and with Facebook and Google, all we had to do was click a button, and we got the data report sent, no questions asked. Look for a follow-up here soon with what I find in the download.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You can also call Apple Care at 1-800-692-7753 to request that Apple deletes your data, if that's your choice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apple says it will streamline the process to make it more user-friendly, making it easier to get a copy of your data and tools to deactivate and/or delete your account beginning in May in Europe. It will roll out the more consumer friendly privacy page in the U.S. later this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apple does sell ads</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Apple also does sell ads as well, on a far smaller scale. These appear in the News app and App Store, based on your interests. By default, on the iPhone you've allowed Apple to serve you ads based on what it thinks are your interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To ensure ads are relevant, Apple's advertising platform creates groups of people, called segments, who share similar characteristics and uses these groups for delivering targeted ads,&quot; the policy reads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Want to stop Apple from doing this? Go to the settings section on the iPhone, click Privacy, and click advertising at the way bottom. Click the LIMIT AD TRACKING tab. You'll also need to click AD INFORMATION to opt out of ad targeting in the Apple News app and the App Store. <BR></SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mark Zuckerberg's announcement last week that Facebook plans to comply with Europe's tough data privacy rules for users nationwide is a large step forward for the new regulation, which gives consumers more control over how their data is gathered, used and shared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many large internationally active U.S. banks are already grappling with the General Data Protection Regulation, which takes effect May 25, including spending significant sums in updating their systems. Of the U.S. companies that completed their compliance work, 40% spent more than $10 million, according to a PwC survey conducted last year. One incentive to devote resources to compliance is the fine for violations, which is potentially 4% of global revenues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Big banks, fund companies, large insurance companies are all working through large GDPR compliance efforts,&quot; said Jeff Sanchez, managing director, information security and privacy at Protiviti. &quot;For smaller community and regional banks, it's more dependent on their analysis of what their customer base looks like and what their exposure to European data subjects is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following is a look at the European rules, including which institutions must comply and what is required.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Who has to comply?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's not crystal clear which U.S. banks must comply.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Banks that have European offices have to. So do banks that market or sell products or services to Europeans. This can include something as simple as having a website translated into a European language like French or German.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. banks that don't have a presence in Europe but do have European customers are a gray area. If the bank has only a small number of European customers and they're living in the U.S., then there's little need to worry about the new rules.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's no threshold you have to cross before GDPR applies to you,&quot; Sanchez said. &quot;Realistically, if you have one European customer, nobody is going to come after you for GDPR violations, you're so far down in the priority of regulatory review. I don't know that if I had one European customer I would go through the effort of complying with GDPR. But technically, you would be subject to GDPR.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Residency and citizenship aren't the triggers for GDPR. What matters is where a person is when they're communicating with the bank. An Irish citizen living in a New York condo with a New York bank mortgage, for instance, is not subject to GDPR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But if a European customer of a U.S. bank makes a data privacy complaint to EU regulators, that bank will come under GDPR scrutiny.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Banks that have European customers should already be meeting the existing European privacy directive, which includes some of the same requirements that GDPR entails.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They shouldn't be starting from a blank slate,&quot; said Richard Hogg, IBM global GDPR evangelist. &quot;They are hopefully already meeting some of the privacy and security needs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The struggles of GDPR</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One difficult element of the rules for banks is the consumer data rights. For instance, there's a right to data portability - the customer needs to be able to ask for and immediately receive an inventory of all data the bank has on him or her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is how the whole Facebook thing hit the news,&quot; Sanchez said. &quot;Facebook made this available for individual customers to see what data Facebook had on them. People realized Facebook had all this information they didn't realize it had.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Providing an inventory of all the data a financial institution has about a person is difficult, Sanchez said, because it's not just traditional data types, like bank account number and transaction history, which banks can readily access. It includes information about when the customer visited the bank's website and what they did there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're probably capturing in their log every time I sign in and sign off to my online banking app,&quot; Sanchez said. &quot;That's data they have about me that they have to be able to provide.&quot; If the bank is capturing cookies and IP addresses, it has to share these, too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bank also has to remove all traces of a customer's personal information if she asks it to. This is called &quot;right to erasure.&quot; (In an earlier version of the rules, it was called, somewhat more poetically, &quot;right to be forgotten.&quot;)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In financial services, it might not be reasonable or practical for the bank to remove all the information they have about me, because some of that they may be required to keep for regulatory purposes,&quot; Sanchez said. &quot;So there's an extensive process of documenting the logic of what data do we have, what data are we able to delete, if we're not deleting that data, what's our justification for not deleting it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The right to the data inventory and to data erasure applies to data banks gather from third parties like credit bureaus and LexisNexis as well as internal data. It also applies to paper documents and backup files. These requests have to be met within 30 days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a lot of discussion and people are waiting to see if there's going to be additional clarification from European working groups about backup files,&quot; Sanchez said. &quot;From a practicality perspective, it's difficult to expect companies to go into backup files and remove data from backup tapes and backup sources. From a technical perspective, it would be incredibly difficult to scrub those backup tapes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are technologies that help. IBM, for instance, has personal data discovery tools that can find where consumer data lives throughout an organization and gather it to provide to a customer and/or erase it from the bank's servers and backups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But according to Sanchez, there are no tools that do everything. Some are designed to comb through unstructured data, others are focused on structured data. There are separate tools for searching data stored in cloud applications and storage. No technology exists that can find paper files.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's not like there's one silver bullet able to do this everywhere,&quot; Sanchez said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consent is another challenge - asking for and receiving the customer's consent before doing anything with his or her data. A few vendors including Trunomi have software that automates the consent process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Sanchez said that while in the beginning, most banks assumed they were going to have to get consent, as the deadline has drawn closer, banks are using other approaches to justify using a customer's information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GDPR offers six legal reasons for companies to collect and process consumers' information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Legitimate interest&quot; is the reason being used most frequently. This is where the bank can prove that its use of customer data is mutually beneficial for the customer and the company. For instance, if a financial institution is sharing transaction data with an anti-fraud analytics company, that could be considered legitimate interest - it's to the benefit of the individual and the company to ensure a transaction is not fraudulent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Europeans have made some comments that suggest they believe U.S. companies are overusing legitimate interest,&quot; Sanchez said. &quot;But we do see a lot of use of legitimate interest as the basis for processing instead of consent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The presence of a contract is another way to avoid having to ask for consent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The basic compliance part of GDPR, IBM's Hogg said, is not technology related - it involves people, policy, and process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Clients have been scrambling over the last year to put in place process changes and education to make all employees aware of, what is personal data, why we need to meet these regulations,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's also a security component to GDPR, what Europeans refer to as &quot;data protection.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IBM provides data security including encryption of personal data, as do many other vendors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Data protection also includes controlling and monitoring who can access and use information, and having an incident breach readiness plan in place that includes notifying regulators of a breach within 72 hours. (New York's cybersecurity rules also require this.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The current average for most organizations to discover they have a breach is 100 days,&quot; Hogg said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The starting point for GDPR compliance, Hogg said, is to do a privacy risk impact assessment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some organizations haven't yet started that,&quot; he said. &quot;If they can at least complete their impact analysis, which is still doable in a few weeks, that will give them a gap analysis and help them come up with an appropriate plan they can show regulators.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The starting point for regulators, he guesses, will be to go after big data breaches and large social media organizations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even banks that determine themselves immune to GDPR still have a need to rethink data privacy. Facebook's Cambridge Analytica scandal has lawmakers considering tougher privacy rules.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another impetus is American consumers, who have long been naive about data privacy but are waking up to the idea that their personal information is worth guarding. In an IBM-commissioned Harris poll released Monday, 78% of American said a company's ability to maintain the privacy of their data was extremely important. Only 20% said they trust companies to keep their data private.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mark Zuckerberg's announcement last week that Facebook plans to comply with Europe's tough data privacy rules for users nationwide is a large step forward for the new regulation, which gives consumers more control over how their data is gathered, used and shared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many large internationally active U.S. banks are already grappling with the General Data Protection Regulation, which takes effect May 25, including spending significant sums in updating their systems. Of the U.S. companies that completed their compliance work, 40% spent more than $10 million, according to a PwC survey conducted last year. One incentive to devote resources to compliance is the fine for violations, which is potentially 4% of global revenues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Big banks, fund companies, large insurance companies are all working through large GDPR compliance efforts,&quot; said Jeff Sanchez, managing director, information security and privacy at Protiviti. &quot;For smaller community and regional banks, it's more dependent on their analysis of what their customer base looks like and what their exposure to European data subjects is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following is a look at the European rules, including which institutions must comply and what is required.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Who has to comply?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's not crystal clear which U.S. banks must comply.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Banks that have European offices have to. So do banks that market or sell products or services to Europeans. This can include something as simple as having a website translated into a European language like French or German.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given the ease of signing up for cloud application services and the real needs they fill day-to-day, many non-IT department end users have been the ones to adopt SaaS apps into corporate networks. Whether or not you have done so yourself, in today's &quot;app economy,&quot; it is more important than ever for everyone to assume some level of responsibility for security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To assess the baseline security of a new SaaS app, start with the app itself. Especially, as we noted in this previous article, the areas of authentication, encryption and policy. Beyond that, pay attention to these two additional topics: basic infrastructure and cybersecurity citizenship.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SaaS infrastructure</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A SaaS provider often makes information about their own physical infrastructure, network and operational practices public. What should you be looking for? At a minimum, the security profile of your SaaS provider should approximate that of your own company. Ideally, and even better, it exceeds your standards. Try to find the answers to these types of questions:</SPAN></P>

If private, is the data center on-premise or hosted in an off-site facility? Or in a cloud provider? If public, which one(s)?&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Good SaaS citizenship</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The last area to consider is how the SaaS provider interacts with the security community at large, such as its membership in industry organizations, contributions to industry standards and groups and maintenance of regulatory compliance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The range and severity of cybersecurity threats has led to a healthy degree of industry collaboration and information sharing. The Cloud Security Association, as one example, counts more than 90,000 individual members, 400 corporate members and 34 working groups, including several that are SaaS-specific.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even if a SaaS provider does not disclose corporate memberships to any such organization or standards group, it can still be a positive sign when employees participate individually, or engage in relevant best practices, such as those promoted by the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP), which promotes the development of trusted apps, or the Web Application Security Forum Consortium, which tracks and reports on many common vulnerabilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then there are also industry specifications. A SaaS vendor should be able to provide a SOC reports, which outline compliance to internal controls for security, availability, processing integrity and confidentiality. The ISO/IEC 27000 level standards provide additional benchmarks for audited information security practices. Critical for some apps is alignment with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI/DSS), which includes firewall, authentication, IDS and other security requirements when infrastructure carries credit card information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, a SaaS vendor can demonstrate its compliance with government regulations or policies. A medical or health-care app, for instance, may need to adhere to the security terms within the U.S., for example Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). Today, any app may be subject to EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which governs the processing and movement of personally identifiable information (PII) and other sensitive information, as defined by this new standard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Applications geared toward the U.S. Federal government may also need to comply with specific security controls. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication 800-53 catalogs these controls, except those related to national security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">End users, take action</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the Pre-SaaS world, assessing a vendor's security profile was a job for the IT department. Now everyone can-and should-assume some ownership of IT security. That should be the case not only with being smart about passwords, settings and the app itself, as discussed previously, but also with knowing something about a SaaS provider's infrastructure and industry engagement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The primary concern is not so much with the well-vetted and best-known services. Although even apps created by cloud giants can have vulnerabilities, too. The more pervasive risk derives from the sheer size of today's SaaS market, which has grown from hundreds to a multiple of thousands of apps, adding significant additive potential for vulnerability. Do they all offer a minimum standard of security? What level do they offer? And what level do you require? Like it or not, in this world of democratized IT, as a SaaS end user you now bear some responsibility for answering those questions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's no secret that companies are always trying to improve customer satisfaction. Happier customers directly translate to retention, more sales and overall business growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marketers understand this and play a central role in how customer experience is managed - they are the key drivers of the buying journey. And the marketing function is one area where many organizations hope to tap the benefits of artificial intelligence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hope is that with AI advancements, marketers can both save time and enhance the customer experience to provide superior service. Automation should leave time for marketers to focus on the aspects of their job that are more strategic and creative, like building the next digital campaign that will catch consumers' attention.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Additionally, the ability of AI to automatically analyze data can enable marketers to deliver relevant and personalized content to potential buyers, allowing them to improve the customer experience at every digital touchpoint.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For marketers striving to improve customer experience and increase sales, let's explore the following AI-enabled strategies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AI-enabled customer retention</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AI can analyze and optimize the customer experience by detecting the patterns of use that lead to dissatisfied customers, giving brands an opportunity to mend relationships and prevent churn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Retention insights rapidly capture data from machine learning to identify past events that put customers at high risk of taking their business elsewhere. Marketers can then easily view all instances that have contributed to customer dissatisfaction - and AI can help decide what the next customer interaction should be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having instant access to information allows marketers to offer unique promotions to customers as an incentive to stay with the brand, or to simply send a thank you email for their ongoing loyalty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Personalized recommendation engines</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AI's ability to make consumer recommendations increases the potential for marketers to identify other products and services that customers might be interested in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, an AI bot can recommend items, provide product advice, and anticipate customers' wants and future purchases before the customer may even realize they need something. For example, past purchases and browsing history can be used to suggest add-on items that customers may find useful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let's say you've just put a new water bottle, a jumprope and a pair of sneakers from your favorite athletic brand into an online shopping cart. You get distracted and plan to complete your purchase in a few hours, but before you even do that, you receive an email from the company with the items you left in the cart - making sure you don't miss out on them before they are out of stock.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They also add an item you might enjoy - a matching gym bag to round out your purchase so you can easily carry all of your new gear. This is a simple scenario in which recommendation engines use data to offer relevant content to customers and make the overall buying experience even better. The AI-enabled engine can also help make recommendations by comparing an individual's choices with other similar consumers to move the customer further along the buying journey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Best channel and contact time predictions</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AI-enabled marketing tools can hold the promise of optimizing customer interactions by identifying the best contact time and channel for each customer, as a way to make their buying experience as smooth as possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, AI can differentiate between a 20-something who logs into their email app on their smartphone during lunch time and a grandparent who logs onto a desktop browser once a week to keep in touch with family. Due to the difference in habits, AI will recommend distributing messages across different channels and at different contact times to best reach the individual, and automatically keep track of the results.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This technology enables you to reach your target customer, regardless of their internet usage. AI can analyze the variety of signals they receive each day and use these insights to determine the next best action for each individual. For example, this may include a recommendation to reduce the number of marketing messages to ensure that the customer doesn't opt-out because of excessive points of contact.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Image recognition</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the future, we'll begin to see more marketers use AI-enabled image recognition to intelligently track customer interactions in-store, determine how much attention outdoor ads or window displays receive, and more. New interactive displays can help customers &quot;try on&quot; different outfits, or make recommendations that are aligned with what they're already wearing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, if a green-eyed shopper is wearing a blue crewneck sweater, they would be guided toward green sweaters with a similar cut to complement their eye color and match their personal style.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AI-driven technologies such as face-recognition are very powerful, but this is an area where marketers must be very careful not to invade customer privacy in counter-productive ways. It has always been critical to respect consumer privacy and with new regulations such as GDPR being enforced soon, these actions should be taken to the next level. Marketers should focus on the opportunities to use these new technologies to provide superior customer experiences while being mindful of governance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thankfully, there are good compromises available that can provide valuable demographic data while respecting governance laws and without compromising customer privacy - for example, cameras pointing at knee-height can still provide marketers with valuable demographic data on customer age and gender without identifying individuals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As AI-enabled marketing technology continues to advance, marketers should consider how these assets can help their overall brand strategy. Despite having a wide range of consumer types, buyers expect brands to think of them on an individual level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The days of mass emails and simple name personalization are over - consumers expect more.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Money managers around the globe are considering the impact on their technology sector investments of incoming rules over data and its use - with awareness heightened by recent issues related to social media platform Facebook Inc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Starting May 25, the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation comes into force, and with it a set of stringent rules and penalties for non-compliance. The regulation puts the onus on all companies that hold personal data of EU citizens - regardless of the firm's location - to keep that information safe from privacy and data breaches. EU citizens will be able to manage the amount of information they are releasing, who accesses it, and how it is used.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Breaches can result in a hefty fine, with companies hit with penalties of up to 4% of annual global revenue or (EURO)20 million ($24.6 million) - whichever is greater.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Any regulation that affects the technology sector would be a serious consideration for investors; technology companies account for 25% of the S&amp;P 500 index; 21% of the Russell 1000 index; and 20.5% of the Russell 3000 index.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Money management executives are working hard to figure out where the risks and opportunities might lie as a result of the far-reaching rules.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's really empowering the final client,&quot; said Lorenzo Angelini, portfolio manager-European equities at Amundi in Dublin. &quot;It is a big change - if you look at the technology ecosystem in general, the flow of data has been a source of value (for some firms) and a way to understand client behavior, target advertising and enhance services.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the rules were debated for years, and the enforcement date known for some time, the issue has been brought into sharp focus for money managers and analysts by recent allegations against Facebook Inc. and its data protection processes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The timing of the Cambridge Analytica scandal (regarding Facebook and its user data) was interesting as it was out before GDPR comes into effect, but serves as a timely reminder of what's required under regulation,&quot; said Neil Campling, co-head of the global thematic group, specializing in technology, media and telecoms at Mirabaud Securities Ltd. in London. &quot;It doesn't matter if (a company holding and using information) is a small enterprise or a large, multinational corporation, the policies apply regardless&quot; of size and company location.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rules carry &quot;a whole variety of implications - businesses based around using those data sets, for example for target advertising, could be severely impacted,&quot; added Mr. Campling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Allianz Global Investors' analysts in Frankfurt spent time last year running &quot;a very thorough in-house analysis of the legal text (which) led us to the view that GDPR is more than just a series of boxes that corporates must tick to be compliant,&quot; said Marie Rupp, analyst at the money manager. &quot;We believe it will be a game-changer for business(es) dealing with private data. So we are prepared to spend even more time in the month ahead to scrutinize the way things will take shape in certain sectors, and from this, understand the impact on our investment portfolios.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Different considerations</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The impact of GDPR on portfolio holdings is being assessed in a number of ways by money managers and analysts. Some of the managers are not taking action on their exposures just yet, but rather watching and waiting for opportunities, and risks, to play out. However, one source working at a money management firm said he has heard from two equity managers that they are taking profits in the technology sector, using the Facebook issue as well as GDPR as a trigger to reduce holdings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shoaib Zafar, Geneva-based senior analyst at SYZ Asset Management, said the technology sector has been an overweight position for the firm for the past few years, with opportunities in both old technology such as hardware, and newer ideas such as cloud computing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While SYZ is not making any changes just yet to its technology holdings, it is watching for two potential impacts of GDPR and the Facebook issue. &quot;Do advertisers delete Facebook, and will there be a churn of users?&quot; Mr. Zafar said, noting that the &quot;inactive&quot; or less frequent users of Facebook are at risk of leaving the platform or deleting their data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The risk around GDPR for some money managers is the impact on technology companies' revenues that come from advertising. &quot;We are very much looking at how valuable is this business, and is it a business we want to own?&quot; said Philip Smeaton, chief investment officer at Sanlam U.K. Ltd. in London. Executives will consider how exposed their portfolio companies are to advertising-type revenues, &quot;profiting from people's data, and how much companies (are) protecting and securing it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And for Sanlam U.K., the Facebook issue could present an opportunity. &quot;We are always looking for investment opportunities, companies (that are) unique ... Facebook for us is a company that would qualify to that. Whenever there is a step back in the market or an opportunity, we check if that uncertainty is a good entry point or not ... But clearly there is a lot of uncertainty - will people turn off their Facebook accounts, (will the company) be restricted (regarding its) advertising, which would hurt their revenue and potentially profitability,&quot; said Mr. Smeaton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mirabaud Securities, whose clients are largely global equity institutional investors, moved to a negative view on Facebook this year. &quot;It's a company that requires a huge amount of information on end users ... and now that gets hurt by the inability to have that information as before. We turned negative directly (as a result) of GDPR,&quot; said Mr. Campling. But the firm has moved to a positive view on companies that provide data protection or defensive services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also considering the regulation from two angles is Amundi's Mr. Angelini. Executives are considering back-end implications of the new regulation - working to understand whether &quot;the IT infrastructure that is already in place can sustain the workflow required&quot; by GDPR. He said the other consideration relates to the front end - if a business is based on a flow of information that will no longer be there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amundi has been asking corporations for a number of months about the actions they are taking and what they expect from GDPR. &quot;The focus I have is on the front end because we are not overly exposed to those themes, but more on the back end - what you want to have is a company with a nice infrastructure which is new, cloud-enabled (and) GDPR-proof.&quot; He said companies with silos are more at risk of losing track of data. &quot;And there is the tail risk of something happening, someone stealing data, and that is a brand reputation type of risk,&quot; added Mr. Angelini.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And an ongoing focus will be the impact of GDPR on technology and social media firms' earnings and profitability. &quot;Their capital expenditures have to go up, and already they are pretty high relative to a lot of other companies in corporate America,&quot; said Sunil Reddy, senior vice president and portfolio manager of Fiera Capital Inc.'s growth equity team in Dayton, Ohio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Further regulation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Reddy said GDPR is just one piece of heightened scrutiny regarding data-heavy platforms, with considerations extending to the U.S., India and Indonesia, for example. &quot;Looking over the next couple of years, will these potential regulatory changes impact growth rates, and if (growth rates) come down how will they impact margins and earnings? All those are uncertain and we'll be watching closely,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Allianz Global's Ms. Rupp agreed: &quot;By definition the scope of GDPR goes much beyond Europe ... so from the beginning, the U.S.-based tech giants were among the primary stakeholders of GDPR. The recent issues of data misuse are increasing the necessity of having a regulation for data protection, and ... not only in Europe. The U.S. will eventually have its own&quot; version of GDPR, she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guillermo Felices, head of research and strategy in BNP Paribas Asset Management's multiasset, quantitative and solutions unit in London, said the team there also is considering the risk of tighter regulation of the U.S. technology sector - an issue thrown up by the Facebook data privacy concerns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From a macro point of view, any increased regulation &quot;is a material uncertainty in a sector that has been so prominent that it could be a significant hurdle for the market to take - it may affect the way people perceive risk and volatility in particular. It may be one of those things that increases volatility to a slightly higher level than (markets have been used to) in recent months,&quot; said Mr. Felices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, it is important to put the regulatory issue into perspective and &quot;frame it in the context of how profound and long&quot; the U.S. tech sector rally has been. &quot;The question in investors' minds is where does this end? I think that's what the market is trying to digest - whether this is a bump in the road or more fundamental and may derail the business model of these big giants, and whether it's hurt beyond repair,&quot; added Mr. Felices.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justin Fox | Bloomberg View</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">714 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A lot of people these days think Facebook has become an incorrigible, toxic &quot;regime of one-sided, highly profitable surveillance&quot; under the near-absolute control of a &quot;sovereign and singular ruler,&quot; as University of North Carolina information scholar Zeynep Tufekci summed up in Wired a couple of weeks ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm not sure the harshest Facebook critics are right. I agree, though, that the company is different even from rival miners of user data, such as Google. Google provides discrete services (search, email, maps, etc.) in exchange for exploiting what it learns from its users' behavior to better target ads. At Facebook, the targeting and the core service seem inseparable. The social network is a &quot;utility,&quot; as founder and sovereign ruler Mark Zuckerberg used to tell people before it became clear that this might have negative regulatory implications. It is also, as he once told tech journalist David Kirkpatrick, &quot;more like a government than a traditional company.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This provides an interesting lens through which to view the question that has launched a thousand thinkpieces over the past month What is to be done about Facebook? Think of the company as a global government ruled by a despot, and the options do seem quite limited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook's outside shareholders certainly don't have much leverage, with King Mark controlling 59.9 percent of the corporation's voting shares despite owning less than 16 percent of shares overall, according to the proxy statement filed last week. Shareholders did revolt against a 2016 Zuckerberg plan to allow him to sell $74 billion worth of his Facebook shares without losing control, but they have no means of revolting against current arrangements other than selling their shares -- which many can't do, given that it's the fifth-most-valuable company on the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Customers also have limited recourse. As Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., asked Zuckerberg last week &quot;If I'm upset with Facebook, what's the equivalent product that I can go sign up for?&quot; Zuckerberg's reply -- &quot;the average American uses eight different apps to communicate with their friends and stay in touch with people&quot; -- didn't exactly settle the matter. As Princeton University computer science professor Arvind Narayanan put it on Facebook sort-of-competitor Twitter on Monday:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Governments can of course act to rein in Facebook's behavior, and last week's congressional hearings are an indication that U.S. authorities are beginning to follow in the footsteps of their peers in the European Union, whose General Data Protection Regulation takes effect in May. Then again, regulation more often entrenches incumbents than deposes them, and tech analyst Ben Thompson makes a pretty convincing argument (warning paywall) that while the GDPR will be a hassle for Facebook and Google, it may improve their competitive positions by devastating rival advertising networks that follow internet users from site to site. (Other recent developments in Europe involving privacy laws may pose a bigger threat, though.)&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, there are Facebook's employees, until recently a singularly committed, talented group but now showing signs of discontent. As TechCrunch's Josh Constine put it last month</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's tough to build if you think you're building a weapon. Especially if you thought you were going to be making helpful tools. The melancholy and malaise set in. People go into rest-and-vest mode, living out their days at Facebook as a sentence not an opportunity. The next killer product Facebook needs a year or two from now might never coalesce.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That, in the end, really gets at the threat to Facebook and Zuckerberg. It's not that the company's current status as the dominant social network or Zuckerberg's absolute control of it is under serious siege; it's that Facebook may find it harder and harder to dominate whatever comes next -- as Microsoft did after it became the target of growing public criticism and an antitrust action in the late 1990s. But what if whatever is coming next on the social network front takes a really, really long time to come?</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">DUBLIN</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DUBLIN - U.S. lawmakers demonstrated an increased appetite for regulating technology giants when they grilled Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg about privacy last week. But the future of Facebook's relationship with its 2 billion users is less likely to be determined from the halls of Congress than it is from an unassuming 18th-century townhouse in Ireland's capital packed with lawyers, technology experts and gumshoe investigators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Europe has been moving aggressively to impose order on the tech space. Already, it has inflicted painful penalties on Apple and Google for their business practices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, technology companies are readying themselves for sweeping new privacy rules that will go into effect next month across the European Union. They could face billion-dollar fines if they fail to give European users far more control over their personal information.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether Congress follows the European model, as some lawmakers floated last week, or whether big tech companies determine it's too cumbersome to  treat the 500 million people of the European Union differently from the rest of the world, Europe is likely to keep setting the global pace for aggressive regulation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As a first mover, that has now become a baseline,&quot; said Dean Garfield, the president of the Information Technology Industry Council, a Washington-based trade group for tech giants such as Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google. Europe &quot;is increasingly setting the norm.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Europeans have embraced the role.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The E.U. is a real regulatory superpower, and it exports its values and its standards,&quot; said Christopher Kuner, a director of the Brussels Privacy Hub at the Free University of Brussels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the center of the action is Helen Dixon, Ireland's data protection commissioner. Because the European operations for many big technology companies are headquartered in low-tax Ireland, Dixon is set to become the top cop for U.S. tech giants that include Facebook, Google, Apple, LinkedIn and Airbnb when the new privacy regime comes into force on May 25. She will have the power to slap companies with fines of up to 4 percent of global revenue - which for Facebook could mean penalties of up to $1.6 billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Their business model is around monetizing personal data, and this creates very significant challenges in terms of fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals,&quot; Dixon said in an interview in her Dublin townhouse office. &quot;It creates a type of surveillance and tracking of individuals across the Internet that undoubtedly needs regulation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook's latest scandal has been perfectly timed to draw attention to Europe's long-planned privacy rules. On April 4, the company said &quot;malicious actors&quot; had used its search tools to match previously hacked email addresses and phone numbers to Facebook profiles. That follows the company's report that Cambridge Analytica, a data analysis firm hired by President Trump during his 2016 campaign, improperly accessed 87 million Facebook users' names, &quot;likes&quot; and other personal information - in many cases without their knowledge or consent. The matter has spawned investigations on both sides of the Atlantic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Europe, Dixon joins an elite rank of enforcers, many of whom happen to be women, holding power over the U.S. tech industry. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her partners include Andrea Jelinek, an Austrian data protection regulator who is expected to lead a new board of E.U. consumer-privacy cops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the E.U. capital of Brussels, top justice official Vera Jourova has challenged Facebook in recent weeks over the Cambridge Analytica affair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And then there's Margrethe Vestager, the bloc's competition chief. She thwacked Google with a nearly $3 billion fine and is forcing it to overhaul how it presents sponsored shopping results. She is making Apple pay $16 billion in back taxes to Ireland. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vestager, who was in Washington on Friday, has said she is increasingly turning her attention to issues around user data - a development that has cheered privacy advocates and chilled technology companies, which complain they are being targeted for their success.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It has become almost a habit of looking into data issues when we do a merger procedure, antitrust procedures,&quot; Vestager told reporters. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Data is an asset,&quot; she said in a follow-up interview. &quot;You can mine it; you can work it; you can do completely different things.&quot; She said that regulators were treating data as a &quot;completely different creature&quot; than they did five years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. state officials have taken cues from her antitrust enforcement strategy. Josh Hawley, Missouri's attorney general, mimicked her investigation into Google, for instance, and has demanded the company give him the same evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People like Josh Hawley don't want European consumers enjoying better protections than Missourians, so when you have this disparity in how the law is being enforced, it puts pressure on every other jurisdiction to say, 'What did we miss?' &quot; said Luther Lowe, the vice president for government relations at Yelp, the reviews website. Yelp has been Google's chief antagonist in the European Union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States was caught somewhat flat-footed by the Facebook privacy scandal. Lawmakers have debated whether to enhance the government's ability to investigate and penalize tech giants that misuse consumers' most sensitive information. But Congress has so far failed to pass a single comprehensive privacy law for the digital age, stumbling in no small part because of partisan warfare and intense, well-funded lobbying efforts from Silicon Valley.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, lawmakers are clearly intrigued by what Europe is doing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Would you support legislation to back that general principle: that opt-in, that getting permission, is the standard?&quot; Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) asked Zuckerberg during the first of two days of hearings. &quot;Europeans have passed that as a law. Facebook's going to live with that law beginning on May 25. Would you support that as the law in the United States?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zuckerberg sought to reassure users in the United States that they will get the same privacy controls as Europeans after the new laws come into effect, although he allowed himself some wiggle room on the specifics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think everyone in the world deserves good privacy protection,&quot; Zuckerberg said. &quot;Regardless of whether we implement the exact same regulation, I would guess that it would be somewhat different, because we have somewhat different sensibilities in the U.S. as to other countries.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For their part, European policymakers have relished their trendsetting status.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The U.S. public right now is realizing that maybe the Europeans have done something that is in their own interest,&quot; said Jan Philipp Albrecht, a German member of the European Parliament who played a leading role in drafting the privacy regulations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now technology companies are bracing for the privacy rules to kick in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Ireland, the new powers will be a big change for a regulator who until recently was dinged for a lax approach to big technology companies. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some critics say Irish officials were holding their punches because of the country's tech-dependent economic growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm not sure how much there's influence in it, how much there's politics in it, and how much general consensus there is in Ireland in not regulating the big U.S. giants,&quot; said Max Schrems, an Austrian privacy advocate who scored repeated legal victories against Dixon's predecessor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People who have watched Dixon work say her style can be conciliatory rather than confrontational. Critics say her office has not always been aggressive about defending citizens' rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You have a culture within the institution which relies on a limited use of statutory enforcement mechanisms and more on persuasion,&quot; said T.J. McIntyre, a law professor who is the chairman of Digital Rights Ireland, a group that has challenged how the Irish government retains information about its citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But observers say Dixon's beefed-up resources and enforcement powers are likely to give her new ammunition as she pushes companies to fall in line.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just four years ago, Ireland's data protection office was a backwater, with 25 employees housed above a convenience store outside Dublin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Dixon took the reins in late 2014, she fought for more funding, quadrupled her staff and moved into the capital. The Georgian townhouse is a brisk walk away from the glassy new tech district that has sprung up around a once-scruffy dock area. Dixon plans to hire another 40 staffers this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think the data protection authority was sufficiently staffed at the point where I came on board,&quot; Dixon said. &quot;I think it has been rectified.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, enforcement may require a fight: Both Google and Apple have appealed Vestager's judgments against them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new E.U. rules, known as the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, will give individuals far more control over their personal data. Companies will have to spell out what they will use data for and give users clear choices about whether to agree. Individuals would be able to force companies to return data to them if they wanted to leave a service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vestager, the competition chief, said the aim is to ensure that Web users &quot;feel they are somewhat in control&quot; of their data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She mentioned Facebook's recent troubles with Cambridge Analytica.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think the situation is quite good, because very often when something happens that sort of turns people's attention to an issue, you say, 'Oh. It's brand new. We have to regulate,' &quot; she said. In this case, she said, Europe already has a legal framework that &quot;actually, for real, allows the individual to enforce their rights.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK - Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg often came across as one of the smartest people in the room as he jousted with U.S. lawmakers demanding to know how and why his company peers into the lives of its 2.2 billion users. But while some questions were elementary, others left Zuckerberg unable to offer clear explanations or specific answers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A series of tough inquiries about how much personal information Facebook vacuums up on and off its social network seemed particularly vexing for Zuckerberg, who couldn't quantify it. He was vague about whether Facebook was a monopoly and whether it would offer an ad-free option, as well as about how the company could offer the same level of privacy protection to users around the world.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zuckerberg squirmed when pressed about a 2011 agreement with the Federal Trade Commission that was designed to force Facebook to tighten its privacy controls. While maintaining that Facebook had adhered to the terms of the settlement, Zuckerberg repeatedly conceded that the company still made mistakes that led to the personal details about 87 million Facebook users being turned over to Cambridge Analytica, a data-mining firm tied to President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prodded by the Cambridge scandal, the FTC is now investigating whether Facebook violated their agreement. If Facebook did, it could be fined $40,000 per infraction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lawmakers also got Zuckerberg to acknowledge that government regulation of Facebook and other internet companies is &quot;inevitable,&quot; although he was vague about what kind of rules he believes are needed or what he would support. He brushed off suggestions that Facebook has built a monopoly but didn't identify the company's competitors. Instead, he asserted without elaborating that &quot;the average American uses eight different apps to communicate with their friends and stay in touch with people.&quot; He didn't mention whether those other apps included Facebook's own Messenger, as well as Instagram and WhatsApp, which are also both owned by Facebook.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zuckerberg also didn't rule out the possibility that Facebook might eventually offer a version giving people the option of paying a monthly fee in exchange for not having their personal information mined for advertising. Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook's chief operating idea, floated the idea in an interview with NBC before Zuckerberg appeared in Congress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Zuckerberg didn't elaborate, the concept would be similar to what both video-streaming service Hulu and music-streaming service Spotify already do by offering a free version supported by ads or a commercial-free version that requires a subscription.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zuckerberg emphasized that Facebook will always offer a free version of its network. But Facebook's business model, as Zuckerberg repeatedly explained in his testimony, depends upon ads shown to people based on the interests they share on the network. That strategy generated $40 billion in ad revenue for Facebook last year, helping to make it one of the world's most valuable companies just 14 years after Zuckerberg started the business in his Harvard dorm room.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Facebook users can turn off some data collection used for advertising, it can't stop tracking entirely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zuckerberg also wasn't clear on how the company would offer all users privacy protection equal to that offered by European Union regulations taking effect next month. While he's said he supports the General Data Protection Regulation, Facebook probably isn't following those rules quite yet. &quot;Don't say we already do what GDPR requires,&quot; one passage from his cheat sheet reminded him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rep. Steve Scalise, a Republican from Louisiana who is a former computer programmer, focused on how extensively Facebook tracks on users who aren't logged into the network or don't even have an account. Zuckerberg had said that such data is collected for &quot;security purposes,&quot; for example to flag unauthorized users trying to log in. Scalise, though, asked if the data is also used as part of Facebook's business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zuckerberg said he believes the company collects &quot;different data for those&quot; and would follow up with further details - a line he frequently fell back on when he didn't provide a direct answer.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zuckerberg squirmed when pressed about a 2011 agreement with the Federal Trade Commission that was designed to force Facebook to tighten its privacy controls.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prodded by the Cambridge scandal, the FTC is now investigating whether Facebook violated their agreement. If Facebook did, it could be fined $40,000 per infraction.</SPAN></P>

Instead, he asserted without elaborating that &quot;the average American uses eight different apps to communicate with their friends and stay in touch with people.&quot; He didn't mention whether those other apps included Facebook's own Messenger, as well as Instagram and WhatsApp, which are also both owned by Facebook.</SPAN></P>

Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook's chief operating idea, floated the idea in an interview with NBC before Zuckerberg appeared in Congress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Zuckerberg didn't elaborate, the concept would be similar to what both video-streaming service Hulu and music-streaming service Spotify already do by offering a free version supported by ads or a commercial-free version that requires a subscription.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zuckerberg emphasized that Facebook will always offer a free version of its network. But Facebook's business model, as Zuckerberg repeatedly explained in his testimony, depends upon ads shown to people based on the interests they share on the network.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Facebook users can turn off some data collection used for advertising, it can't stop tracking entirely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zuckerberg also wasn't clear on how the company would offer all users privacy protection equal to that offered by European Union regulations taking effect next month. While he's said he supports the General Data Protection Regulation, Facebook probably isn't following those rules quite yet. &quot;Don't say we already do what GDPR requires,&quot; one passage from his cheat sheet reminded him.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Zuckerberg said he didn't know, Lujan enlightened him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So the average for non-Facebook platforms is 1,500,&quot; the congressman said. &quot;It's been reported that Facebook has as many as 29,000 data points for an average Facebook user.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apple is updating its products and services to bring the company in line with the EU's forthcoming privacy protection rules, General Data Protection Regulations&nbsp;(GDPR). Among other improvements, customers will be able to download all the information Apple keeps about them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is GDPR?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GDPR rules are designed to bring existing data protection laws into the 21st century. They give individuals the right to see what information companies hold about them, oblige business to handle data more responsibly, and put a new set of fines and regulations in place. Almost any entity that handles personal data will be impacted by the GDPR rules.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These changes may be taking place in Europe, but there is expectation most big tech firms will apply similar protections outside Europe, which will give more effective protection to most people - which is a good thing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[ Further reading: Private by design: Why Apple's iOS meets the needs of healthcare IT ]Why it matters</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Europe's tough stance on personal privacy had already prompted many in the tech industry to get their act together. The Facebook/Cambridge Analytica scandal means many more of us now understand why such protection matters, particularly at a point in human history at which so much of what happens next will be defined by artificial intelligence (AI) and data analytics. This information is powerful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've never believed that these detailed profiles of people, that have incredibly deep personal information that is patched together from several sources, should exist,&quot; Apple CEO TimCook recently said. They can be &quot;abused against our democracy,&quot; he observed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What Apple has done so far</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apple recently introduced updated privacy protections across all its products, which now offer a new Data &amp; Privacy screen during setup. This explains how Apple and apps use your data and promises that the company's solutions are designed to minimize the collection and use of your data. It also describes how on-device processing is used whenever possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apple explains:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When we use data to create better experiences for you, we work hard to do it in a way that doesn't compromise your privacy. One example is our pioneering use of Differential Privacy, where we scramble your data and combine it with the data of millions of others. So we see general patterns, rather than specifics that could be traced back to you. These patterns help us identify things like the most popular emoji, the best QuickType suggestions, and energy consumption rates in Safari.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Effectively this means Apple's products are private by design, which should open up interesting opportunities for the company in future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GDPR means Apple will tell you what it knows</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These aren't the only privacy enhancements we can look forward from Apple as it prepares for GDPR rules to become mandatory in May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company has said it plans to update its Apple ID management page with a way to let users download a copy of all the data they have stored with the company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company will allow users to download data across individual apps, which means data concerning your music playback choices or which news stories you've been reading will be as easy to download as information about the contents of your Contacts or Calendar apps. &nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's the equivalent of the data Facebook allows its users to download about themselves, though Apple's pre-existing commitment to privacy means we don't expect too many unpleasant surprises - however, I will be paying particular attention to Location data logs when I check my records.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GDPR also means Apple will give you more control</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apple also intends to make it much easier for its customers to control their data. That means we'll be able to:</SPAN></P>

</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's a significant improvement. You have been able to do some of these things by contacting the company, but this takes time. These new tools will empower customers to vet and manage their own information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apple provides new GDPR developer tools</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apple closed out March by providing developers with an extensive set of tools to help them handle data requests made by EU users under new GDPR rules. These will enable developers to let users &quot;manage data that's associated with your app and stored in iCloud by using native APIs and Web APIs,&quot; the company said.&nbsp;These will also include tools to enable a developer's own users to delete their data from a developer's app. More here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What are the rollout plans?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apple has already begun introducing these improvements. The most recent software updates introduced new Privacy rules and systems and a new Privacy icon that appears when an app requests your personal data. The company says the additional enhancements discussed here are scheduled for introduction in Europe when GDPR rules come into effect on May 25. The iPhone maker says it will make these features available to customers outside Europe at a later point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Privacy is a human right</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cook has gone on record to call privacy a &quot;human right.&quot; He's highly critical of companies whose business plan is to monetize customers, saying:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The truth is, we could make a ton of money if we monetized our customer. ... We've elected not to do that. We're not going to traffic in your personal life. Privacy to us is a human right, a civil liberty.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apple as a company has an extensive privacy governance structure, which is described here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Its employees are required to take privacy training, and the company has a Privacy Board made up of a cross-functional group of senior representatives from across the company that handles privacy-related issues.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The topic of data privacy was front and center on the minds of lawmakers this week as Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg went before Congress to discuss how the company manages customer data. One of the biggest takeaways of Zuckerberg's two days of testimony is that, as Zuckerberg himself said, some form of data privacy legislation is &quot;inevitable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there are already a number of proposed and soon-to-be-enacted data privacy regulations that information managers need to keep a close eye on.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One bill, introduced this week by Sens. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), would serve as a &quot;privacy bill of rights.&quot; Called CONSENT, it requires opt-in permissions from users to use, share or sell their personal data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another piece of legislation called theHonest Ads Act, proposed last October by Sens. Mark Warner (D.-Va), Amy Klobuchar (D.-Minn.) and John McCain (R-Ariz.), would require data managers to keep a &quot;complete record&quot; on advertisers who spent in excess of $500 on political ads the year before.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then there's the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which will take effect May 25. All companies worldwide that hold data on EU citizens must follow the GDPR guidelines, which call for data managers to better protect customer privacy andnotify customers within 72 hoursof a data breach. GDPR also requires that organizations inform EU citizens how their personal data is used, and guarantees the right to be forgotten - enabling citizens to request that their personal data be permanently deleted if they request it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;GDPR in general is going to be a very positive step for the Internet,&quot;Zuckerberg told Congresson April 11. He added that giving users the controls &quot;makes sense to do more.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Data managers are already making adjustments in accordance with GDPR, according to Lorrie Faith Cranor, director of theCyLab Usable Privacy and Security Laboratoryat Carnegie Mellon University and former chief technologist at the FTC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are already seeing that impact from companies with a European presence,&quot; Cranor said. &quot;They are updating their privacy policies and controls. They are adding more consent boxes, setting expiration times for data, and making it easier to update and remove data. In general I think there is going to be a lot more tracking of what data is collected and where it goes, and the ability to let customers control their data.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But IT managers may need to do more if proposed U.S. data governance legislation becomes law.Creating opt-in requirements for data collection, for example, could affect the bottom line of any company that counts on an advertising revenue stream, noted Charles King, president and principal analyst at Pund-IT.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That means that companies, including social media giants such as Facebook, would be required to gain users' explicit permission before commercially exploiting their data,&quot; King said. &quot;That could have a measurable impact on those companies' ability to generate revenues and be profitable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tighter data regs could also hinder financial service companies, such as insurers, if U.S. lawmakers look to implement the data privacy statutes established in Europe, said Mitch Wein, vice president of research and consulting at Novarica. At a high level, the EU assumes data ownership always remains with the individual. That means private information cannot be sold or reused in anyway without permission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This kind of regulation means insurers would be unable to use customer data to recommend and underwrite core products from other lines of business at the point of sale, Wein said. Under longstanding EU rules, which have been rolled into the governing body's existing GDPR framework, consumers also reserve the right to withdraw their consent at any point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What if consent is withdrawn, how do regulators guarantee it's deleted?&quot; Wein said. &quot;Data is stored in the cloud, and in a lot of other places. How do insurers properly delete it?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One way companies can keep data secure is by implementing blockchain. Because blockchain has a data structure that can betime-stampedand signed using a private key to prevent tampering, the technology is seen as a natural fit for managing the accountability, authentication, confidentiality and sharing of information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As data privacy regulations become tighter, retailers may need to change how they use geolocation and wireless beacons to keep track of user purchasing preferences. Companies such as Amazon rely onarchived customer datato decide how to stock its new retail bookstores. Beacons draw data fromcustomers' smartphones and wearable devices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New data privacy regulations could also limit how retailers collect insights from mobile payment patterns. They usePOS datato better forecast sales, boost promotional effectiveness and reduce the number of out-of-stock items.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To keep retail data secure, retailers should remain compliant with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), including following the latest version of theTransport Layer Security (TLS) protocol.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for the CONSENT legislation announced this week, don't look for it to impact data managers in the near future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think we are a long way off from having something actually pass, so for the time being, there will be no impact,&quot; Cranor said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This Wednesday, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg spent his second day testifying before Congress in a navy suit and tie, facing the lower chamber, after spending Tuesday in front of the Senate. This all comes after the London-based political consulting firm, Cambridge Analytica, which was contracted to perform data mining and analysis services by both the Trump and Cruz 2016 presidential campaigns, was accused of collecting and misusing over 50 million users' data without their consent and for purposes other than those advertised.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coming after one of the world's deadliest school shootings in Parkland, Florida, just weeks ago, the ongoing Facebook privacy scandal brings only the discord regarding liberty and privacy further into the national spotlight. With many fingers, though perhaps justifiably, being pointed at Zuckerberg and even some users, I find it important to recognize where the responsibility of ensuring a reasonable right to privacy ultimately lies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Next month, the European Union will bring into effect the General Data Protection Regulation , which will further protect the personal data of its citizens. Zuckerberg initially claimed that he would abide by these regulations and even claimed that the privacies were being shared by Facebook users worldwide. He has since become more and more vague in his dialogue regarding the GDPR and has not committed to enacting its changes to its over 2 billion users.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is here where the fingers of those on the pro-privacy side of the spectrum start taking their aim towards Zuckerberg. Many say that he carries the obligation of protecting the site's users on his shoulders as his social responsibility to the business. Save any massive drop in userbase, though, what consequences does Zuckerberg, or Cambridge Analytica for that matter, have for not honoring these regulations?&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is the duty of those troubled by these regulations to respond, either by deactivating their accounts or by petitioning their representatives for further regulation. I am of the opinion that the aforementioned responsibility of ensuring a reasonable right to privacy rests only on the shoulders of Zuckerberg to the extent that he is legally obligated. The most efficient means of ensuring said right to privacy is through further regulation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To clarify, I am not at all in defense of Zuckerberg's refusal to further his commitment to user privacy from a personal standpoint. I would like to think that if I were in his position, I would prioritize transparency and privacy across the platform. I am instead saying that there should be no expectation that Zuckerberg do this until the government implements legislation to back it up.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I think the EU laid a solid legislative framework, and if it is something by which we as a nation are troubled, we should follow their footsteps. Until then, I am content signing over my privacy with every terms of service agreement.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Social media analysis tools have gained traction among top insurers looking to thwart fraudulent claims and bolster underwriting. But with Facebook facing mounting pressure over its mismanagement of private user data, the fallout will likely be the creation of new federal regulations aimed at all companies that collect personal identifiable information, experts say, with extensive implications for the insurance industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. lawmakers will be looking to implement data privacy statutes similar to those first established in Europe back in 2012, says Mitch Wein, VP of research and consulting at Novarica. At a high level, the EU assumes data ownership always remains with the individual. That means private information cannot be sold or reused in anyway without permission.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This kind of regulation means insurers would be unable to use customer data to recommend and underwrite core products from other lines of business at the point of sale, says Wein. Under longstanding EU rules, which have been rolled into the governing body's existing General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) framework, consumers also reserve the right to withdraw their consent at any point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What if consent is withdrawn, how do regulators guarantee it's deleted?&quot; said Wein. &quot;Data is stored in the cloud, and in a lot of other places. How do insurers properly delete it?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Proposed regulations would also have significant impact on vendors, such as LexisNexis or Verisk Analytics, as questions arise over the levels of consent received from consumers in capturing the data. The same is true for insurtechs partnering with carriers at record rates, as companies' reliance on third-party data for claims, underwriting and product marketing has skyrocketed in recent years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also see:Allstate, Nationwide among insurers using public data sources for fraud detection</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The bottom line is, we know there are going to be regulations that impact data security and privacy, and there will be reputational damage for insurance company CIOs or other individuals that do not follow them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Insurers are used to being regulated, at least on the state level. Carriers, agents and brokers often include privacy statements disclosing how exactly they will use personally identifiable information (PII) data, according to Karen Pauli, principal at Strategy Meets Action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Early on, insurers' legal teams shied away from green-lighting the use of PII data from social media, due to lack of permission and attribution. Today, a large amount of data in use by carriers today is aggregated--or not personalized-and used for segmentation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The industry grew more comfortable because it social media has become a part of the fabric of our lives,&quot; Pauli says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Insurers, particularly in workers compensation, have used social media data for claims fraud detection for years, she added. Companies, however, questioned the valuable insights that could be derived from the data for underwriting and the marketing of new products. Insurers' social media data strategy now spans all three functions, thanks to carriers' growing comfort with data analytics and advanced machine learning tools to identify trends in customer behavior.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They didn't have that before,&quot; said Pauli. &quot;They knew facts about policyholders, but social media data can provide insights on behavior. That is the new frontier.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Due to insurers' established practices, questions may now arise around the acceptable uses of third-party data, Pauli concluded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The key for insurers will be whether &quot;a reasonable human being believes their data will be used for claims, underwriting and marketing purposes,&quot; she says.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over Mark Zuckerberg's two-day marathon hearings before Congress, he dodged dozens of questions from the Senate and House committees by saying, &quot;I'll have my team follow up with you after this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While some of the questions were clearly too specific for Zuckerberg to answer without referring to some sort of written documents, many of his &quot;follow up&quot; promises were nothing more than his lawyer-coached way of saying no or refusing to answer a question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the hearings, the committees with keep the hearing record open for a period of time for members to submit additional questions in writing. They will then send those questions to Facebook for answers with a deadline, a Facebook spokesperson told Observer.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well, that will be quite a pile of work for Zuckerberg and his team, if he meant what he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here is everything Zuckerberg promised to follow up on with the committees:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">On Cambridge Analytica and Privacy&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether Facebook had performed any audits to ensure that improperly transferred data was deleted before the Cambridge Analytica case surfaced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The number of users affected by the Cambridge Analytica breach by state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether Aleksandr Kogan, who sold Facebook data to Cambridge Analytica, still has a Facebook account.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What other firms did Aleksandr Kogan sell Facebook data to, other than Cambridge Analytica. (Zuckerberg said there are &quot;a couple of others.&quot;)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How effective is Facebook's &quot;Bug Bounty program,&quot; in combating harmful transfer of data, in addition to identifying unauthorized access to data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether U.S. users will have the same right to object to being micro-targeted by advertisers as laid out in the European Union's&nbsp;General Data Protection Regulation&nbsp;(GDPR).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether Facebook is willing to change its business model in the interest of protecting privacy. (&quot;I'm not sure what that means,&quot; Zuckerberg said.)</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How much data Facebook has on non-Facebook users.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether Facebook tracks offline data through devices that have been connected to Facebook at some point. (The question was raised by Senator Roy Blunt of Missouri. Apparently Zuckerberg didn't understand the question very well.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How long Facebook keeps your data in its system after you have deleted your Facebook account.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also, whether Facebook keeps a backup version of your data after account shutdown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether Facebook will change users' default settings to minimize the collection and use of their data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether the data mined by Facebook for security purposes used in advertising targeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">On Russia and Misinformation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether some of the anonymous group pages currently on Facebook were created by Russian agents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Exactly how many fake accounts Facebook has shut down. (Zuckerberg estimated the number to be in the tens of thousands.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether Facebook is a politically neutral public forum. (Ted Cruz is eager to know.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Details about the deployment of AI tools that are designed to combat misinformation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relative to health-focused innovations across history, iOS, iPhones, iPads and other mobile devices are very recent additions to the medical care arsenal, but they seem to be good for you, fresh research claims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mobile&nbsp;solutions boost patient satisfaction</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apple has been investing deeply in mobile healthcare. A global survey published today suggests that investment is not misplaced. It shows that hospitals that have put mobile device initiatives in place see an instant improvement in patient satisfaction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One-third (32 percent) of places implementing such a plan saw a significant increase in patient experience scores, while 96 percent saw some positive impact.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[ Further reading: A tale of two hospitals that adopted Apple's Health Record app ]How are these devices being used? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Don't get too excited (yet), because despite cutting-edge tales of iPads being used in surgeries or mobile phones being deployed to help track the spread of virulent disease, the most widely adopted usage cases are far more prosaic. You'll see mobile devices in use at:</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deployment is accelerating</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those are the starting points, but the survey of 600 healthcare IT pros (conducted by Vanson Bourne&nbsp;and commissioned by Jamf) shows the usage case expanding:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over half (59 percent) expect to see mobile devices used by clinical care teams and administrative staff (54 percent) in future.&nbsp;This chimes well with a&nbsp;recent Spyglass survey&nbsp;that showed nine out of 10 U.S. healthcare systems plan significant mobile investments in the next 18 months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's also confirmed by the fresh survey, which shows 47 percent of healthcare IT professionals plan to increase mobile device use over the next two years - but there's a big hurdle in the way of more rapid deployment:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Security and privacy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bugbear for mobile medicine is the same animal currently consuming confidence in the wider mobile sector: security and privacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regulatory fines for violations of HIPAA in the U.S., DPA in the U.K. and GDPR in the EU can cost organizations millions of dollars, so using insecure solutions really isn't worth the risk at any level of the medical IT food chain.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why are security and privacy important to healthcare?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Think about patient health records. Confidential patient data needs to stay that way, and as that data is more widely shared, securing that data becomes a bigger challenge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's a particular challenge when 25 percent of patients are expected to use portable health record systems on their devices by 2020.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MDM systems must improve</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another barrier to more rapid adoption seems to be lack of satisfaction and confidence in existing Mobile Device Management (MDM) and security solutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's a very real sense of dissatisfaction around existing systems, the research shows. This probably reflects a lack of user-friendliness and compatibility when using some proprietary solutions built to support so-called &quot;hardened&quot; devices in use in the sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When asked, IT pros noted, data privacy (54 percent), security/compliance (51 percent) and/or software patches (40 percent) as the biggest barriers to wider mobile device deployments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thirty-one percent of decision makers won't implement mobile strategy until they can be more certain of effective security protection in the devices they deploy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apple's private personal health solution</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This translates into an opportunity for the private by design&nbsp;iPhone company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apple already has industry-leading security and privacy built in, and a proven commitment to software patches means c.80 percent of all actively used Apple devices are running the most recent version of the OS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apple's recently introduced Health Records app for iPhone is clear evidence of Apple's advantage. It makes patient data portable in such a way as to put the patient in complete control of that data.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vol. 1</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">No. 1</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1042  words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Surveys show that the greatest compliance challenge of pending General Data Protection Regulation is Article-17: Right to Erasure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first step for compliance is to locate ALL of the source records for the customer, regardless of nicknames, abbreviations, spelling variations, typos and data quality issues. Many organizations are overly confident in their ability to accomplish this because of past, often massive investments in creating a &quot;single customer view&quot; (SCV) which, in theory, has already identified and linked all the related records for each customer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The SCV can be implemented on a variety of platforms such as customer relationship management (CRM), master data management (MDM), marketing customer information file (MCIF), customer data platform (CDP) and other data consolidation platforms. In fact, many companies have multiple, conflicting SCV instances by maintaining multiple platforms such as a CRM and MDM system. So it's natural for senior executives to assume that problem has been solved and GDPR compliance should be straight-forward based on those systems.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SCV's GDPR Problem</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But all of these current SCV systems share a common problem for GDPR compliance. That problem is the fact that their original business requirements for configuring their fuzzy match algorithms are traditionally skewed to err heavily on the side of &quot;false-negative&quot; match errors (incorrectly not matching records from the same person when low confidence) to minimize the risk of any &quot;false-positive&quot; errors (incorrectly matching records from different people).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Configuring the fuzzy match engines of all these platforms is basically the process of determining the appropriate balancing point between false-negative vs. false-positive match errors. The &quot;identity data governance&quot; process of business users and data stewards defining &quot;match success criteria&quot; is driven by assessing the business impact of the various kinds of match errors to identify that point of balance. Then the technical team executes various match fine-tuning test iterations to determine the precise technical configuration of the match engine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In order to comply with past regulations such as healthcare's HIPAA, that balance point has necessarily been at the extreme end of false-negatives. That is, &quot;better to allow a million false-negative match errors than risk a single false-positive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GDPR Moves the Match Goalposts</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the business requirements for GDPR compliance are significantly different than traditional SCV fuzzy matching. Conceptually, GDPR &quot;moves the match goalposts&quot; to the other end of the spectrum by imposing tremendous penalties for right to erasure failures. It is not acceptable to erase &quot;most&quot; of a customer's records - you must reliably erase ALL of a customer's records.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GDPR dramatically increases the business impact of false-negative errors. No longer is the business impact limited to minor problems such as some contacts receiving duplicate mailings. With GDPR there can now be hefty fines associated with those errors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You Can't Erase What You Can't Find</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's easy to get people to agree conceptually with the point that one can't erase what one can't find. However, it's also natural for people to rigorously defend the success of past CRM, MDM and other SCV projects. The temptation is very strong for people to underestimate and dismiss the scope of the risk faced by the organization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CRM vs MDM SCV Match Conflicts: Deeper than Total Customer Counts</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A simple test to challenge these risk assumptions is to simply how many total customers are reported by your CRM vs MDM platform? Those numbers likely differ, and often can differ substantially. Even small total customer count differences hide surprisingly extensive match conflicts - especially for &quot;wealth management&quot; and other VIP customer segments which have more records and data quality complexity, and thus greater risk of impacting operations, analytics, marketing and compliance failures (KYC, HIPAA, GDPR, etc).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, a 2 percent total customer count difference was found to be the net result of match conflicts impacting over 25 percent of source records.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The next question should then to be to ask how the total false-positive errors compare between the two systems. Those numbers may not even be currently tracked by your organization. In other words, a massive area of risk is not even being monitored. News of this oversight will immediately raise the alarm amongst your organization's governance, risk and compliance (GRC) team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Governance, Risk and Compliance (GRC) Colleagues can Help</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The good news is that you have a number of colleagues that can help, specifically in the field of governance, risk and compliance with titles such as chief privacy officer, chief internal auditor, chief compliance officer, chief counsel and data protection officer (a new position required by GDPR for large organizations). These people are empowered with the authority and budgets to elevate your GDPR risk analysis to the appropriate level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Audits Are Your Friend</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the most important steps an organization can take is to do a &quot;GDPR gap analysis&quot; of the false-negative errors for their current SCV platforms. Even rough order of magnitude (ROM) metrics can provide key information such as if the level of risk is on the order of just a few thousand records - or millions? Those metrics can then be used to more effectively prioritize and allocate your GDPR compliance resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, in just a couple days an in-depth comparison of your CRM vs MDM match conflicts can generate detailed conflict metrics that can provide a strong indication of the degree of potential false-negative errors. And that kind of analysis can often be done without accessing personally identifiable information (PII) and thus avoid the typical kinds of legal and administrative delays that would often be encountered to access PII.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The resulting GDPR gap analysis framework also provides a reusable infrastructure to evaluate any reconfiguration that may be required of your current SCV match platforms to create a &quot;GDPR identity hub&quot; and enable more reliable compliance - and also demonstrating appropriate due-diligence to the ICO for any future compliance audits they might conduct at your organization.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mastercard and IBM have founded a company with a very narrow goal: to help organizations scramble their data to thwart hackers and comply with Europe'sGeneral Data Protection Regulation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They established Truata in Ireland as a trust to provide a new standard in data hosting and anonymization conceived by Mastercard that will help businesses build a security layer using methods only they know. The process falls in line withpseudonymization, another process under GDPR in which businesses handling European consumer data would never keep all of the personal or payment credential data for one person in one place. Rather, parts of it would be stored in different silos on a network.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Data anonymization ensures that data can never be attributed to a specific individual,&quot; said Truata CEO Felix Marx, who recently served as executive vice president of services in Asia-Pacific for Mastercard.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The European Union has set May 25 as the deadline for GDPR compliance. Any company that deals with European customers has to comply with GDPR or risk hefty fines. The foundation of the regulation rests on the European Union's contention that consumers &quot;own&quot; their data, not the companies in possession of it. The regulation affects any company that handles payments or personal information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Truata's process for anonymization starts with the data-driven business client &quot;de-identifying&quot; the data using a methodology known only to them. That data is transferred to Truata, where any remaining identifiers are removed and replaced with a token.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That data is transferred to Truata's data vault, where the token is replaced with another token known only to Truata. The data is then used to perform analysis for each customer, Marx said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a deep security process that includes measures like &quot;noise&quot; and &quot;perturbing data&quot; techniques that are well known to data scientists and essentially replace portions of actual data content through a statistical process. It preserves the analytical value of the data, while preventing the ability to convert it back to its original form.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because GDPR requires businesses to secure data in certain ways, as well as honor the premise that a European consumer has the only say over whether it can be used for any other marketing or sales purposes, many observers feel the European Union regulation could ultimately prevent major data breaches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;GDPR will undoubtedly lead to data protection that reduces the incidence of big breaches, even in the U.S.,&quot; said Al Pascual, research director and head of fraud and security for Javelin Strategy &amp; Research. &quot;Consider that the many, if not most, medium to large enterprises do business in Europe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though not all of these businesses will take the same steps, anonymizing and pseudonmynizing sensitive customer data will frustrate criminals, driving a shift in their behavior, Pascual said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Other data will still be at risk, including intellectual property and business financial data, meaning we can expect ransomware to continue, if not increase,&quot; he added. &quot;Criminals are going to look for ways to get paid and if they can't compromise and sell it to misuse personal identifiable information, they are going to pile it into other schemes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the past month, Truata and IBM began providing cloud, analytics and cognitive computing capabilities to data protection measures Truata will develop with clients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The GDPR sets a new standard for data privacy,&quot; Truata's Marx said. &quot;Our conversations with regulators, potential customers and other entities impacted by GDPR have shown that when it comes to analytics and the need to have compliance with the GDPR, many organizations have not yet started to consider the need for anonymized data.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed,Smart Insightsreported that only 6% of companies it surveyed said they were fully prepared, while 21% indicated they were close, but nearly 50% said they were aware of the looming deadline but hadn't started compliance work yet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Truata is working to close that gap dramatically in the next several weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Organizations need to be more proactive in the way they manage all of their personal data - employee, customer and proprietary - to ensure they remain compliant with GDPR,&quot; Marx said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many organizations have underestimated the measures that will be required to comply, Marx added. &quot;Consent management solutions, designated data privacy officers, special controls on data access, and new legal bases for use of data will all change the way they manage and use data,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regardless of which companies are prepared to comply or not, the GDPR brings on a significant change in how payments companies will handle European consumer data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, there will still be a long tail of smaller U.S. businesses that won't take the same steps to protect customer data because they don't do business overseas,&quot; Javelin's Pascual said. &quot;It's simply, they don't care about complying, which will make them more attractive targets in this post-GDPR future.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Currently, a U.S. credit card processor who has locked down and protected a consumer's payment card and personal data would essentially be able to store that data forever.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under GDPR, a European consumer could request that it be stored only for future payment reference for a period of time, or be taken off the database completely.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg will feel the glare of the national spotlight on Tuesday as he testifies to Congress for the first time.Lawmakers are demanding answers about how Cambridge Analytica, a British data firm hired by the Trump campaign, was able to improperly obtain data on upwards of 87 million Facebook users.The hearings are certain to produce a media spectacle, with wall-to-wall coverage expected on cable news. Zuckerberg's initial trip to Capitol Hill on Monday provided a taste of what's to come, with a crush of reporters and cameras trailing his every move.If Zuckerberg doesn't play his cards correctly, Facebook's reputation and stock price could suffer. Already, some lawmakers have suggested new regulations on tech companies might be needed.Here are five things to watch for as Zuckerberg takes the witness stand.How does Zuckerberg handle the pressure?Zuckerberg has never before faced the kind of adversarial questioning he's likely to receive from lawmakers during the hearings on Tuesday and Wednesday.His tone and attitude will be extremely important, particularly given the outrage in Congress over the data scandal and Russia's election interference. If Zuckerberg, 33, comes across as arrogant, the hearings could turn into a debacle for Facebook, experts say.&quot;He's got to try to be authentic and humble and avoid any degree of arrogance and glib answers. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He's got to be thoughtful and avoid what happened to Bill Gates in the antitrust case. He was arrogant and slouched,&quot; said Lanny Davis, a crisis communications expert and columnist for The Hill. Zuckerberg has been practicing for his testimony with Facebook's Washington team and advisers have urged him to be humble, according to The New York Times.In that vein, Zuckerberg is poised to begin his testimony with an apology, according to his prepared remarks for the House Energy and Commerce Committee.&quot;We didn't take a broad enough view of our responsibility, and that was a big mistake. It was my mistake, and I'm sorry. I started Facebook, I run it, and I'm responsible for what happens here,&quot; Zuckerberg plans to say.How aggressively do lawmakers question him?Lawmakers for years have clamored to hear from Zuckerberg directly about Facebook's practices. Now, more than 14 years after the company launched, they will get their chance.Senators will get the first crack at Zuckerberg on Tuesday in a joint hearing of the Senate Judiciary and Commerce committees.Ahead of the hearing, members like Sens. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) and John Kennedy (R-La.) have voiced discontent with Facebook and signaled that the company's response to the Cambridge Analytica scandal has been inadequate.&quot;We have a problem. Our promised digital utopia has minefields in it. Mr. Zuckerberg has not exhausted himself being forthcoming,&quot; Kennedy said Sunday on CBS's &quot;Face The Nation.&quot;Other senators to watch for in the hearing include Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.); both threw down the gauntlet when officials from Facebook, Twitter and Google testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee in November.&quot;You created these platforms, and now they're being misused. And you have to be the ones who do something about it, or we will. We are not going to go away, gentlemen,&quot; Feinstein said in November.How does he explain Facebook's response to Cambridge Analytica?Facebook's handling of the Cambridge Analytica controversy is certain to be a major focus of lawmakers' questions.The company says it first discovered in 2015 that Cambridge Analytica had improperly obtained user data. In response, it asked the firm to certify that the data would be destroyed.Cambridge Analytica agreed to those terms but then violated that agreement, as The New York Times and The Observer reported last month. Instead, the firm used the data as part of its work on campaigns.Facebook says it was deceived by the firm and has suspended Cambridge Analytica from its platform. But that timeline of events isn't sitting well with lawmakers, who question why it took the company so long to take action.&quot;Why did you not suspend the company from your platform in 2015?&quot; Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) asked in a letter he sent to Facebook. Other lawmakers, like Senate Commerce Committee Chairman John Thune (R-S.D.), have asked similar questions. Zuckerberg has said that Facebook wanted to make sure it verified what had happened before acting.Lawmakers will also want to know if there are other entities that may have obtained user data in violation of Facebook's policies, in the way that Cambridge Analytica did.Zuckerberg and Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg have both said that they're not aware of any other instances of improperly harvested data. But Zuckerberg has said that Facebook is still working to uncover any other violations that may have occurred.What does Zuckerberg say about Russia's election interference?Members of Congress are certain to come armed with questions about how Russia used Facebook during the 2016 presidential race.In his written testimony to the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Zuckerberg confirmed that in the summer of 2016 the company shut down a group of accounts with suspected ties to the Kremlin. The accounts, believed to be a part of the Russian espionage group called APT 28, &quot;created fake personas that were used to seed stolen information to journalists,&quot; Zuckerberg said.&quot;What we found was that bad actors had used coordinated networks of fake accounts to interfere in the election: promoting or attacking specific candidates and causes, creating distrust in political institutions, or simply spreading confusion,&quot; his statement reads.Last year, Facebook sent one of its top lawyers to testify in a series of congressional hearings about revelations that the company had sold $100,000 in ads to the Internet Research Agency, a Russian &quot;troll farm&quot; that's alleged to have conducted an influence campaign ultimately aimed at helping President Trump win the election.Since then, Zuckerberg has vowed to improve the platform's safeguards against disinformation and election meddling.&quot;We were too slow to spot and respond to Russian interference, and we're working hard to get better,&quot; he plans to say on Wednesday.Does the hearing fuel calls for regulation?The biggest worry for Facebook and other tech companies is that the scrutiny from Washington will ultimately result in new laws and regulations.Over the past year, policymakers have grown more critical of the tech industry, though they have yet to translate their frustration into action.Some privacy advocates want the U.S. to develop a regulatory framework like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the far-reaching European Union law that will go into effect next month and gives internet users greater control over their own data.Under that law, websites in Europe will have to be more transparent about what they do with that data and offer users simple controls to restrict how it's used.Though the GDPR will only apply to the EU, Zuckerberg has promised to extend the privacy controls required by the law to all Facebook users around the world.Zuckerberg has taken one step to defuse the anger in Congress by endorsing the Honest Ads Act, a bill that would require social media companies to abide by the same disclosure rules for campaign ads as radio and television.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A coalition of consumer groups is calling on Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to extend new privacy controls that will be required by a new European law to all users of the social media platform worldwide.Trans Atlantic Consumer Dialogue, which represents dozens of consumer groups in Europe and the U.S., sent a letter to Zuckerberg on Monday expressing support for the new European Union (EU) privacy standards, which will go into effect on May 25.&quot;There is simply no reason for your company to provide less than the best legal standards currently available to protect the privacy of Facebook users,&quot; the letter reads.Zuckerberg said last week that Facebook users around the globe will be afforded the same privacy controls that will be required under the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), though he has not offered specifics on the new changes.The new law requires websites to be more transparent about what they do with user data. It will also give users more control over their data, allowing them to more easily give and retract consent for their information.The law also will impose steep fines on companies if they are found to not meet its requirements. Violators under the rules could be hit by fines of at least $24.6 million or as much as 4 percent of a company's global revenue.Those terms have tech companies scrambling to put in place measures to comply with the law. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the law comes at a difficult time for the industry, which is already under scrutiny over its data handling practices.Some privacy and consumer advocates have called for lawmakers in the U.S. to adopt a similar privacy framework following the Cambridge Analytica scandal. The data analytics firm, which worked for President Trump's campaign in 2016, is believed to have acquired data on upwards of 87 million Facebook users without their consent.&quot;The GDPR provides a solid foundation for data protection, establishing clear responsibilities for companies that collect personal data and clear rights for users whose data is gathered,&quot; Monday's letter reads. &quot;These are protections that all users should be entitled to no matter where they are located.&quot;Zuckerberg will face questions from lawmakers on the data leak this week as he heads to Capitol Hill for back-to-back hearings on Tuesday and Wednesday.ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY. The federal government's top ethics official is imploring the EPA to properly investigate Administrator Scott Pruitt's alleged ethics violations and potentially take action against him.David Apol, acting director of the Office of Government Ethics (OGE), told the EPA's top ethics official, Kevin Minoli, that Pruitt's actions &quot;raise concerns and may constitute a violation of the States of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch&quot; as well as President Trump's ethics pledge.&quot;The American public needs to have confidence that ethics violations, as well as the appearance of ethics violations, are investigated and appropriately addressed,&quot; Apol wrote in a letter dated Friday and released publicly by the OGE on Monday.The letter came after a week of reports about numerous controversies involving Pruitt's spending of taxpayer money, hiring practices, ethics and more.The EPA and Pruitt have consistently defended his actions as aboveboard and compliant with relevant laws and standards, but numerous former ethics officials and ethics advocates have disagreed.Apol and his office do not have the ability or authority to punish Pruitt for alleged ethical lapses.Trump, who does have the power to fire Pruitt, tweeted Monday that two of the highest profile controversies involving Pruitt &macr; his travel expenses and an apartment rental from the wife of an energy lobbyist &macr; are &quot;OK.&quot;Pruitt is &quot;doing a great job!&quot; the president added.Harper Neidig and Timothy Cama</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Every organization today is in the &quot;data business,&quot; as they continue to collect volumes of information about their customers. When organized effectively - by integrating data from variety of different sources through master data management - this data can provide important and actionable insights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some enterprises are tackling this challenge with a traditional approach to MDM, which limits what can be done and how quickly they can do it. But coming soon to an MDM hub near you are two key enabling technologies that both augment and/or re-invent MDM as we know it ... graph database and machine learning (ML).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With that perspective in mind, here is more on these two top trends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Graph database</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Graph database is conceptually threatening MDM due to its ability to simplify complexity. But it is also augmenting MDM and data governance via user interface and query. Here are some implications:</SPAN></P>

<BR><UL CLASS="c9"><LI CLASS="c10"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"><NOBR>&bull;</NOBR></SPAN></P>
<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Simpler modeling of complex relationships yields more humanistic user interfaces for all concerned. This model agility and extensibility enables users to easily and quickly add new data dimensions, hierarchies and linkages.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
</LI><LI CLASS="c10"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"><NOBR>&bull;</NOBR></SPAN></P>
<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The querying of analytics via graph technology also simplifies and turbocharges the ability to query (and discover) data relationships critical to &quot;system of engagement&quot; style systems.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
</LI><LI CLASS="c10"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"><NOBR>&bull;</NOBR></SPAN></P>
<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In practice, quite often the majority of purist graph-specific implementations are either (a) unable to transact for high volume scalability in operational mode, or (b) primarily being used as adjuncts to operational mode/transactional MDM hubs in order to cross-walk or analyze across domains.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
</LI><LI CLASS="c10"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"><NOBR>&bull;</NOBR></SPAN></P>
<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Near term, graph databases will continue to enhance the delivery of data mastering.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
</LI><LI CLASS="c10"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"><NOBR>&bull;</NOBR></SPAN></P>
<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Start-ups and others that are not mega vendors are more capable of introducing and leveraging such capabilities. For examples, see Reltio and Semarchy for data modeling and querying (as well as other UI aspects).&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
</LI><LI CLASS="c10"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"><NOBR>&bull;</NOBR></SPAN></P>
<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As MDM evolves towards &quot;master relationship management&quot; via graph technology, analytical upstarts from the graph world will increasingly add operational capabilities for performance and robustness.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Machine learning</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Machine Learning is stealing the spotlight at the MDM and data governance. Consider:</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><UL CLASS="c9"><LI CLASS="c10"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"><NOBR>&bull;</NOBR></SPAN></P>
<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scalability, complexity and agility are only some of the problems increasingly being solved by machine learning.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
</LI><LI CLASS="c10"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"><NOBR>&bull;</NOBR></SPAN></P>
<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Start-ups and others that are not mega vendors are more capable of introducing and leveraging such capabilities. For examples, see Tamr for scalable metadata mastering, Fresh Gravity for GDPR expert system guidance for enterprise-strength anonymization, etc.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More on machine learning for MDM</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Traditional MDM has been around since the early 2000's. As data volume has grown and the potential value of analytics has exploded, enterprises seeking to compete on analytics struggle to scale mastering efforts with the surfeit of available data sources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clearly, creating robust data engineering pipelines to unify this data at scale is more important -- and harder -- than ever. An &quot;agile&quot; approach, utilizing machine learning can cut time required for unification or analytics projects (around 90%) while scaling to more sources than other traditional approaches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moreover, given the scale of enterprise data, automation is the key to agility and scale. Such enterprise data automation can only be achieved with some human oversight to make sure the results are fast and accurate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not just raw data scalability, but also human process scalability is enabled by machine learning. While we all know to invest in active/integrated data governance for long-term sustainability and return-on-investment of MDM, most all of the currently-marketed classic data governance tools do not exist as integrated solutions and are also lagging in &quot;ML-guided&quot; stewardship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the next several years I expert systems (self-learning, etc.) will work side-by-side with human experts to facilitate, advise, correct and promote best practices in data governance and stewardship, and more data-related tasks for IT pros.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While I expect most MDM vendors to deliver classical data governance over the next 6-18 months, I also project that the innovative best-of-breed data governance software players will focus on machine learning as competitive differentiators. Specifically, mega vendors (including IBM, INFA, Oracle and SAP) are focused to deliver data governance capability in 2018-19 with resulting partner chaos - with every solution provider turning increasingly to machine learning acquisitions and partnerships to bolster their governance capabilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clearly, machine learning will augment (more than replace) MDM and data governance to provide increased agility and scalability. Areas where machine learning will be applied include: data discovery and mapping, entity resolution, relationship discovery and mapping, taxonomy and ontology; and governance and stewardship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bottom line? Organizations should plan now to realize economic value and competitive differentiation from investments in MDM plus graph databases plus machine learning over the next two to five years.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg reiterated his regrets for the social network's lapses of data privacy and security, setting the stage for an apology-laden appearance before Congress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We didn't take a broad enough view of our responsibility, and that was a big mistake. It was my mistake, and I'm sorry. I started Facebook, I run it, and I'm responsible for what happens here,&quot; Zuckerberg's testimony, released ahead of a Wednesday appearance before the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zuckerberg spoke with lawmakers Monday, a day before he is scheduled to testify before the combined Senate Commerce and Judiciary committees Tuesday and the House Commerce committee Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Facebook co-founder comes to Washington amid a drumbeat of concern about how Facebook treats its users' very personal information.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The social network found itself manipulated during the 2016 election season, with Russian influence attempting to foment discord among voters. Then Facebook was forced to admit that tens of millions of Facebook users' information may have been misused by a consulting firm that assisted the presidential campaign of Donald Trump. The outrage that followed has sent Zuckerberg and his senior staff into crisis mode, including the CEO's conceding to his first-ever testimony to Congress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zuckerberg has recently announced several initiatives to better secure user information and prevent misuse of the network. The latest: an election research committee, including independent researchers who will assist Facebook in rooting out weaknesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Facebook will seek researchers' help in preventing future election manipulation on the social media platform and, in its campaign to improve privacy, has suspended two more data firms as part of an ongoing investigation into the potential misuse of user data by political targeting firm Cambridge Analytica.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The formation of an independent election research commission is part of Facebook's strategy to help prevent a repeat of the 2016 presidential election campaign in which more than 3,000 ads were bought by 470 fake accounts and pages run by the Internet Research Agency, a shadowy organization in St. Petersburg, Russia. Many of the ads sought to spread divisive messages to stir up voters and public outrage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The goal is both to get the ideas of leading academics on how to address these issues as well as to hold us accountable for making sure we protect the integrity of these elections on Facebook,&quot;  Zuckerberg said in a note posted on his Facebook page Monday. &quot;Looking back, it's clear we were too slow identifying election interference in 2016, and we need to do better in future elections.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This new election research initiative -- one of several changes announced in the last two weeks -- comes as Zuckerberg defends the firm he co-founded from calls it should face stricter regulations on how it handles its users' data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook is improving its privacy settings to make them easier for users to understand and is toughening advertising verification methods to prevent societal tampering in political issues, the company said last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The social networking giant continued to take steps to recover from the scandal that it now thinks could involve the data misuse of as many as 87 million people, mostly in the United States, when their data was improperly shared by Cambridge Analytica. The social network said it will begin notifying users Monday if their data was shared as part of the incident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Concerns about possible ties to the British political consulting firm led Facebook to suspend two more firms -- San Francisco-based research firm CubeYou and Canadian digital marketer AggregateIQ -- as part of its investigation. Facebook suspended CubeYou on Sunday after CNBC notified Facebook the researcher had quizzes on the platform that collected user data and shared it with marketers. CubeYou had been working with the Psychometrics Lab at Cambridge University, also the workplace of psychology professor Aleksandr Kogan, who Facebook said passed  data to Cambridge Analytica.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The data was generated by a personality app Kogan created,  downloaded 270,000 times but connected to more Facebook users who were friends of those who used the app. Facebook last month said it  suspended Cambridge Analytica because it improperly obtained that data from Kogan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As part of its investigation, CubeYou faces an audit by Facebook. &quot;In addition, we will work with the U.K. (Information Commissioner's office) to ask the University of Cambridge about the development of apps in general by its Psychometrics Centre given this case and the misuse by Kogan,&quot; Ime Archibong, Facebook's vice president of product, saisd in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CubeYou's &quot;You Are What You Like&quot; quizzes had disclaimers similar to the Kogan-created &quot;This Is Your Digital Life&quot; app, about the data being used for academic purposes. Under Facebook's settings at the time, the app could gain access to friends of those who answered the quiz. CubeYou CEO Federico Treu told CNBC the app did not gain access to friends' information, but only to friends who  opted into the app on their own.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook suspended the other company, AggregateIQ, based in Victoria, British Columbia, after whistle-blower Christopher Wylie said Aggregate IQ had worked with Cambridge Analytica parent company Strategic Communication Laboratories.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In light of recent reports that AggregateIQ may be affiliated with SCL and may, as a result, have improperly received FB user data, we have added them to the list of entities we have suspended from our platform while we investigate,&quot; Facebook said in a statement. &quot;Our internal review continues, and we will cooperate fully with any investigations by regulatory authorities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aggregate IQ, on its website, says it  &quot;has never managed, nor did we ever have access to, any Facebook data or database allegedly obtained improperly by Cambridge Analytica.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also in advance of Zuckerberg's testimony, U.S. and European consumer groups asked Facebook to establish privacy standards as stringent as those due to be implemented by the European Union next month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The targeting of internet users, based on detailed and secret profiling with opaque algorithms, threatens not only consumer privacy but also democratic institutions,&quot; a letter addressed Monday to Zuckerberg from the members of the Transatlantic Consumer Dialogue says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The EU will adopt new data rules called the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) on May 25. Facebook's chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg said in January that Facebook's planned improvements to user privacy settings would give the company &quot;a very good foundation to meet all the requirements&quot; of the GDPR.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg reiterated his regrets for the social network's lapses of data privacy and security, setting the stage for an apology-laden appearance before Congress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We didn't take a broad enough view of our responsibility, and that was a big mistake. It was my mistake, and I'm sorry. I started Facebook, I run it, and I'm responsible for what happens here,&quot; Zuckerberg's testimony, released ahead of a Wednesday appearance before the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zuckerberg spoke with lawmakers Monday, a day before he is scheduled to testify before the combined Senate Commerce and Judiciary committees Tuesday and the House Commerce committee Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Facebook co-founder comes to Washington amid a drumbeat of concern about how Facebook treats its users' very personal information.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The social network found itself manipulated during the 2016 election season, with Russian influence attempting to foment discord among voters. Then Facebook was forced to admit that tens of millions of Facebook users' information may have been misused by a consulting firm that assisted the presidential campaign of Donald Trump. The outrage that followed has sent Zuckerberg and his senior staff into crisis mode, including the CEO's conceding to his first-ever testimony to Congress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zuckerberg has recently announced several initiatives to better secure user information and prevent misuse of the network. The latest: an election research committee, including independent researchers who will assist Facebook in rooting out weaknesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Facebook will seek researchers' help in preventing future election manipulation on the social media platform and, in its campaign to improve privacy, has suspended two more data firms as part of an ongoing investigation into the potential misuse of user data by political targeting firm Cambridge Analytica.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The formation of an independent election research commission is part of Facebook's strategy to help prevent a repeat of the 2016 presidential election campaign in which more than 3,000 ads were bought by 470 fake accounts and pages run by the Internet Research Agency, a shadowy organization in St. Petersburg, Russia. Many of the ads sought to spread divisive messages to stir up voters and public outrage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The goal is both to get the ideas of leading academics on how to address these issues as well as to hold us accountable for making sure we protect the integrity of these elections on Facebook,&quot;  Zuckerberg said in a note posted on his Facebook page Monday. &quot;Looking back, it's clear we were too slow identifying election interference in 2016, and we need to do better in future elections.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This new election research initiative -- one of several changes announced in the last two weeks -- comes as Zuckerberg defends the firm he co-founded from calls it should face stricter regulations on how it handles its users' data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook is improving its privacy settings to make them easier for users to understand and is toughening advertising verification methods to prevent societal tampering in political issues, the company said last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The social networking giant continued to take steps to recover from the scandal that it now thinks could involve the data misuse of as many as 87 million people, mostly in the United States, when their data was improperly shared by Cambridge Analytica. The social network said it will begin notifying users Monday if their data was shared as part of the incident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Concerns about possible ties to the British political consulting firm led Facebook to suspend two more firms -- San Francisco-based research firm CubeYou and Canadian digital marketer AggregateIQ -- as part of its investigation. Facebook suspended CubeYou on Sunday after CNBC notified Facebook the researcher had quizzes on the platform that collected user data and shared it with marketers. CubeYou had been working with the Psychometrics Lab at Cambridge University, also the workplace of psychology professor Aleksandr Kogan, who Facebook said passed  data to Cambridge Analytica.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The data was generated by a personality app Kogan created,  downloaded 270,000 times but connected to more Facebook users who were friends of those who used the app. Facebook last month said it  suspended Cambridge Analytica because it improperly obtained that data from Kogan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As part of its investigation, CubeYou faces an audit by Facebook. &quot;In addition, we will work with the U.K. (Information Commissioner's office) to ask the University of Cambridge about the development of apps in general by its Psychometrics Centre given this case and the misuse by Kogan,&quot; Ime Archibong, Facebook's vice president of product, saisd in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CubeYou's &quot;You Are What You Like&quot; quizzes had disclaimers similar to the Kogan-created &quot;This Is Your Digital Life&quot; app, about the data being used for academic purposes. Under Facebook's settings at the time, the app could gain access to friends of those who answered the quiz. CubeYou CEO Federico Treu told CNBC the app did not gain access to friends' information, but only to friends who  opted into the app on their own.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook suspended the other company, AggregateIQ, based in Victoria, British Columbia, after whistle-blower Christopher Wylie said Aggregate IQ had worked with Cambridge Analytica parent company Strategic Communication Laboratories.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In light of recent reports that AggregateIQ may be affiliated with SCL and may, as a result, have improperly received FB user data, we have added them to the list of entities we have suspended from our platform while we investigate,&quot; Facebook said in a statement. &quot;Our internal review continues, and we will cooperate fully with any investigations by regulatory authorities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aggregate IQ, on its website, says it  &quot;has never managed, nor did we ever have access to, any Facebook data or database allegedly obtained improperly by Cambridge Analytica.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also in advance of Zuckerberg's testimony, U.S. and European consumer groups asked Facebook to establish privacy standards as stringent as those due to be implemented by the European Union next month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The targeting of internet users, based on detailed and secret profiling with opaque algorithms, threatens not only consumer privacy but also democratic institutions,&quot; a letter addressed Monday to Zuckerberg from the members of the Transatlantic Consumer Dialogue says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The EU will adopt new data rules called the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) on May 25. Facebook's chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg said in January that Facebook's planned improvements to user privacy settings would give the company &quot;a very good foundation to meet all the requirements&quot; of the GDPR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. and EU consumer groups urged Zuckerberg to commit to &quot;global compliance with the GDPR&quot; when testifying before Congress this week. &quot;These are protections that all users should be entitled to no matter where they are located,&quot; read the letter, signed by Jeffrey Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, and Finn L&uuml;tzow-Holm Myrstad of the Norwegian Consumer Council. <BR></SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c6">Confidence in interaction: the great challenge of Artificial Intelligence</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">833  words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The confidence generated by Artificial Intelligence is one of the guarantees sought by service providers of this type, as trends indicate that the use of these tools will be increasingly common. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to Andrew Ng, current VP and chief scientist of the company Baidu, artificial intelligence is the new electricity, he said during his letter of farewell to Medium, where he assured that the scope of this technology will revolutionize society as electricity He did it at the time. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And several professionals of this type of services already begin to mark the trends of what will make the sector more competitive. As its use begins to focus more and more on the personalization of the messages that are given, until the geolocation of ads according to the tastes of the users. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Today it's easier to post a relevant and useful ad when you're doing the super. Or when you finish running and you might want something to drink, the geolocation of the hand of ad personalization is a clear trend, but not the only one within the uses of artificial intelligence &quot;says Alan Bukrinsky, executive director LivePerson, a company focused on providing artificial intelligence solutions. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lee: Consumers prefer to talk with chatbots </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Therefore, if you are looking for an advertising strategy that helps with this type of services, certain aspects should be taken care of when implementing a strategy. This, according to Bukrinsky, who says that the most important thing is to focus on the client. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is impossible for an automatic learning system to add value if it is fed with unreliable data, and it is difficult to access high quality data if consumers are not willing to share it with you. In the end, the interaction between the client and the artificial intelligence system will result in the learning that the system had with the professional who prepared it to provide customer service, but also the interaction that every day has with the users. &quot;Highlights Bukrinsky. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The opportunity and challenge for marketers is that artificial intelligence can make great improvements in customer interactions and engagement, but it requires a thorough rethinking of how brands get and use data. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A failed case in the use of this type of systems was Tay, the Microsoft computer program that was designed to have informal and fun conversations on social networks, but which had to be removed because it had racist and xenophobic messages. And with that it became evident that the little controlled interaction could make the artificial intelligence system look bad. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As a result of this news, some providers of artificial intelligence services had to pay attention in the training that their systems received, because &quot;something fundamental when it comes to interacting with an artificial intelligence system is that it generates confidence,&quot; Bukrinsky points out. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This trust is important because in the first place, consumers will want to stay longer on the contact platform, and secondly it will be easier for them to provide data that will make their experience better.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lee: Five trends that you will see in the coming years </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In addition to these challenges, an even greater difficulty remains: the security of the information obtained by artificial intelligence systems. In Europe you already have the General Regulation of Data Protection of the EU (GDPR, for its acronym in English) which stipulates that every consumer has the right to know how their personal data are used, in addition to having the right to be erase completely if requested. So, if you do not comply with this legislation, the services ofartificial intelligence that look vulnerable can be disconnected in the old continent. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That is why, if a user does not feel safe when contributing some personal information could begin to resort to this type of practices in order to stay safe. A current case is the one on Facebook, where almost one million users, only in Mexico, were affected by the improper use of data by Cambridge Analytica. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As companies seeking artificial intelligence services it is necessary to provide security and guarantees to customers, because &quot;obtaining data from a user makes the work of artificial intelligence easier and more personalized, but this is not why we must to be invasive and insistent at the time of requesting them, in the end the control over this data is totally of the client &quot;, says the executive of LivePerson. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The client wants to have control and expects the company to make every part of the trip as easy as possible. Consumers want to feel that their brand journey has been designed for their benefit, not the brand. &quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To have greater confidence in the channels of artificial intelligence, the expert recommends that you look for your providers to give constant training to your bots and also take care of the way in which the data of the clients is requested. In addition, the information obtained must go to an encrypted platform that guarantees users that their data is safe. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Information has always been considered a strategic, even weaponized resource. The digital strategy of micro-targeting is at its most sophisticated game when personal information is widely shared on social media. As a result, Facebook's new data security scandal seemed destined to happen, and it reveals that we need legal protections for social media users now more than ever.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Guardian and New York Times investigated Facebook's recent scandal that involved voluntarily giving 87 million users' personal information to Aleksandr Kogan, a social science data analytic researcher from Cambridge University, who later sold these data to Cambridge Analytica, a sub company of Strategic Communication Laboratories .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Through data mining and analytics, both companies created media contents and did real-life intervention, according to Bloomberg's report in Nov. 2015. Cambridge Analytica collaborated with Steve Bannon and used the personal data of Facebook users to help both Ted Cruz and Donald Trump's presidential campaign.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2013, the data was collected through a personality assessment application that connects with Facebook, but the application didn't only collect information of the users who downloaded the app. According to CNN, before 2014, Facebook allowed apps to collect the information of their users as well as their Facebook friends. For the friends who didn't download the personality test app, Cambridge Analytica would use meta-data analysis techniques to decode all the activities they did on Facebook. Researchers from Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the U.S.A. explained that data analytical companies can know you better than your spouse after analyzing 300 web contents that you &quot;liked.&quot; Cambridge Analytica profiled people and put them into different psychographic categories. Using experiments putting various forms of information and content in front of the target audiences, Cambridge Analytica was able to find the fastest way to convert their target audience's perception of Steve Bannon's political agendas; serving as his personal, political weapon to hack the democratic process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook did not partake in any later information abuse after they agreed to give the data to Aleksandr Kogan. According to Facebook newsroom, Facebook asked Kogan and Cambridge Analytica to delete the data that was wrongfully used after finding out how they targeted the voters of the 2016 presidential campaign. However, Facebook did not do any follow-up investigations to find out if Kogan and Cambridge Analytica kept the duplicate or analysis of the data or if they sold the data to anyone else. Even though Mark Zuckerberg admitted the executive mistake and promised many methods for how Facebook will protect users' information in the future, it doesn't change the fact that Facebook is still legally liable for its users' data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a Facebook user and a potential victim of this data security issue, a PR announcement that was crafted over five days after the initial reveal of the problem is just not good enough for me. However, I did sympathize with Mark Zuckerberg when he said to CNN &quot;security is never a problem that you ever solve.&quot; I do understand the difficulty of being ahead of the data miners in this digital age.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We can no longer naively think that we are the consumers of internet, because the truth is that people behind the internet are consuming us. When companies like SCL and Cambridge Analytica are finding ways to mine personally identifiable information from all platforms, all social media companies are subject to this threat. At least these silicon companies have the capability of hiring cybersecurity teams, but what about us? Because we are inducted into the social norm of using social media, the hashtag #deletingfacebook is not yet an option for some of us. Even in the long and complicated terms and conditions, the company only writes what information that users will need to agree to share with the companies, but it never really explains how the company will use the information. We need more legal protections for social media users and companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EU General Data Protection Regulation is going to be enforced in the European Union this year to give users more control over their information and put more regulations on internet companies. Under GDPR, companies will need to explain clearly to users exactly what information will be collected; companies are also obligated to explain why they want this information and if it will be used to formulate the users' psychological profile. This Facebook scandal is not the first time an American internet company lost control over their users' personal data and it won't be the last. Written regulations on this issue are desperately needed. 0SHARESShareTweet Previous</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Europe's new consumer data privacy law spells more trouble for Facebook (FB) than Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google, a Goldman Sachs report said Monday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[ibd-display-video id=3262856 width=50 float=left autostart=true]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook got 24% of its revenue from Europe in 2017 but that could be threatened under the law, called the General Data Protection Regulation, according to Heather Bellini, a Goldman Sachs analyst. The rule takes effect May 25, and restricts how personal data is collected and handled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Facebook could potentially see a negative impact of up to 7% from GDPR, though we would highlight that this impact could be negated completely if it successfully obtains user consent for processing personal data,&quot; Bellini wrote in a note to clients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The damage to Google, however, won't be nearly as severe, she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[investors-newsletters-signup /]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our analysis shows that Alphabet's net advertising revenue could see a -2% to 0% impact from GDPR, given our view that search is largely protected as it relies less on user data to generate advertisements,&quot; Bellini said.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Approved In 2016</SPAN><BR></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Europe first introduced the GDPR in 2012, and approved it in May 2016&nbsp;-- long before the Cambridge Analytica scandal involving Facebook surfaced in March. Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg is to testify before two congressional panels this week on data privacy issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GDPR enables consumers to edit, add or delete data that has been collected upon request. It could impact targeted advertising, analysts say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Given the highly engaged user base and lack of what we would consider a viable alternative social network, we believe Facebook is likely to be successful in obtaining informed consent from the vast majority of its users in the EU,&quot; added Bellini. &quot;However, we acknowledge that recent public scrutiny of data management practices at Facebook may have a tempering effect on citizens' willingness to opt-in, especially in the near-term.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alphabet shares gained 1% to close at 1020.09 on the stock market today. Facebook gave up most of its gains as the market sold off late and ended the session up 0.5% to 157.93.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BERLIN -- These days, you might get more applause for not being on social media than for reaching a follower milestone in Europe's liberal hubs like Berlin or Paris. Concerns over privacy and ethics have triggered an unprecedented debate here that revolves around how, and not whether, to regulate U.S. tech giants. Europe's more loyal users of Facebook and other social media advocates may have felt comforted that major scandals over privacy settings and the platform's business model appeared to mainly affect its U.S. side, such as the recent outcry over how Cambridge Analytica's personal data collection affected &quot;30 million profiles of American Facebook users.&quot; But now, Facebook says that Cambridge Analytica may have obtained data on far more users -- with about 20 percent of them estimated to in fact live outside of the United States. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a separate revelation, Facebook also had to acknowledge on Wednesday that &quot;malicious actors&quot; were able to discover the identities and collect data on most of its 2 billion global users. The mechanisms used by Cambridge Analytica and the &quot;malicious actors&quot; cited by Facebook appear to have been legal and do not constitute a data hack, but rather a deliberate exploitation of information through tools or loopholes Facebook itself provided in the past. While tens of millions of U.S. consumers are affected in both cases, the misuse of foreign users' data could now turn out to be the real problem for Facebook since other countries take privacy issues more seriously than the U.S. government. In India, where over half a million users are estimated to be affected, the allegations have resulted in a governmental request to Facebook and Cambridge Analytica for more detailed information, with an April 7 deadline. Even though India is now Facebook's biggest market -- ahead of the United States -- no Indian media outlets were able to ask questions in a conference call with CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Wednesday. The heavy U.S.-focus immediately triggered criticism because privacy advocates in Mumbai are still looking into reports that Cambridge Analytica may have used Facebook data to influence Indian politics, as well. Facebook's acknowledgments in recent weeks have also triggered furious reactions in a privacy-conscious Europe that has long sought ways to rein in U.S. social media and tech giants. EU regulators have always been much tougher on the tech companies than their U.S. counterparts, for instance forcing them to give users more control, imposing fines for noncompliance and requiring platforms to spot and delete illegal content. The latest revelations could serve as a pretext to toughen existing rules further and force social media companies to implement broader changes worldwide. Germany's justice minister, Katarina Barley, recently said it was unacceptable that users &quot;were being spied on against their will, in order to bombard them with deliberate political adverts or hatred against political opponents.&quot; Barley called Facebook's practices a &quot;threat to democracy.&quot; The European Union's justice commissioner, Vera Jourov&aacute;, similarly said Facebook had facilitated &quot;deep manipulation.&quot; Both remarks came prior to Wednesday's announcement that Europeans had been targeted, too. That's why two countries included in Facebook's acknowledgment on Wednesday are likely causing the social media company a particular headache: Britain and Germany. Perhaps even more damaging to Facebook's business model than tumbling shares may be the sort of EU-style regulation efforts that have been introduced here in recent years. Nevertheless, Facebook CEO Zuckerberg applauded the European efforts in a conference call with journalists on Wednesday, calling them &quot;very positive,&quot; in a somewhat surprising assessment. His praise for Europe's tough data rules -- that have so far been considered detrimental to the company's business model -- may either indicate a real strategy change or could be an effort to calm Europe's nervous regulators by promising eventual change. Zuckerberg has struck an unusually humble tone in recent weeks, as his company has gone through its so far worst crisis, even as critics say that the company has shied away from some key issues. &quot;We intend to make all the same controls and settings available everywhere, not just in Europe,&quot; Zuckerberg said on Wednesday, referring to a major new online privacy law that will take effect in May. Introduced as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the massive overhaul will force all companies operating here to tell their European users which data they have stored on them and provide them with an option to delete that information, among other changes. While European social media skeptics have celebrated the law as almost revolutionary, Zuckerberg stopped short on Wednesday of promising the same rights to users in the United States or other countries disproportionately affected by the latest revelations, including the Philippines, Indonesia, Mexico and Canada. &quot;Is it going to be exactly the same format? Probably not. We need to figure out what makes sense in different markets with the different laws and different places. But -- let me repeat this -- we'll make all controls and settings the same everywhere, not just in Europe,&quot; Zuckerberg said. Europe's tough stance on U.S. tech companies may end up benefiting users around the world, if Zuckerberg follows through on his promises. But in Europe, many already fear that the latest regulations aren't enough.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Organizations that keep data about us should be governed by law to protect information about John Q. Public. The government has all kinds of information about us. We are consumers of the government since the government provides infrastructure to allow us to function. If you drive on the roads, you are using a government service. The large credit reporting agencies may have no relationship with the average person but the credit card agencies maintain all kinds of sensitive information about us and that information is used to generate revenue for them. Does information about us belong to the credit card companies?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If a credit-card agency is compromised and personal information is harvested by hackers, the effects can be devastating. Hackers would be able to steal identities and make our lives miserable. Doesn't it seem fitting if those organizations were held accountable for problems that were caused by their carelessness with our information?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Are you aware of the latest big data scandal? It seems Facebook dropped the ball protecting client privacy. It shouldn't be a big surprise to anyone. Facebook might not make money directly by selling information about you but they are able to direct advertising to good leads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook may have been conceived to allow communications between family and friends but that simple goal was taken and changed by big business. Advertisers can use Facebook to focus on prospective clients, ones that will likely result in a sale.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Do you really believe that Facebook users are the real beneficiaries of Facebook? Facebook founders have made a lot of money but what have the people that use Facebook get out of the deal? Sometimes it seems that us lowly little guys are at the mercy of big business. Facebook is doing us a big favor and owes its users no right to privacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At this moment in time it seems that Europe is much more aware of the rights of the consumer information. General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) are the regulations that will be enforced in Europe in May of 2018. These regulations define the requirements of any organization that maintains information of any European Union (EU) citizens. There are also fines for any company that doesn't conform to the standards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It isn't enough to claim &quot;We are victims&quot; if a company suffers a data breach. If a company chooses to maintain personal information, the company is responsible for any data compromises. Doesn't that seem fair? If a company uses personal information, shouldn't that company be responsible for data being stolen by hackers?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Data breaches cost the average citizen plenty of problems. Isn't it time to force these companies to pay for their negligence?</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You may think the new European standard for cybersecurity doesn't apply to you because you don't do enough business in Europe to fall under the new regulation. Maybe you think your business is too small to be affected by the new regulation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maybe you're wrong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, is the European Union's sweeping and comprehensive data security regulation. Its primary goal is to create more consistent protection of consumer and personal data across all EU nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bad news for businesses is that GDPR's requirements are strict. Stricter, in fact, than the already strict patchwork of U.S. data security laws and regulations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GDPR's definition of personal data is much broader than the one we often use under U.S. laws and regulations and includes IP addresses, social media handles and other pieces of information that a business might collect about a person.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also provides EU citizens and residents a right to erasure and data portability  meaning that people have a right to have their personal data completely eliminated or transmitted to another controller.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GDPR penalties can be steep  up to $20 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The real intimidating news for U.S. businesses is that GDPR's jurisdiction extends well beyond the borders of the EU and allows both its citizens (wherever residing) and its residents to pursue legal action against violating businesses even if those businesses are outside of Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How does a U.S. business determine if the GDPR applies to it?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Start by conducting a data security risk assessment  one that includes an evaluation of whether your business is regularly marketing to or doing business with customers who have some connection to the EU.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Review your business's web presence and determine if your business is monitoring and collecting IP addresses of those using your website. Pay particular attention if those IP addresses originate in the EU.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If your business is doing any of these things, it could be violating GDPR. The bottom line is that your business needs to become familiar with GDPR regulation and its requirements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It will certainly be interesting to observe the nature and breadth of enforcement actions U.S. businesses may see under GDPR, as each EU country is going to be able to enforce GDPR on behalf of its own citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ultimately, advance preparation will be key for U.S. businesses looking to steer clear of enforcement actions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether we like it or not data breaches have become a regular occurrence. IDC predicts that by 2020, data breaches will affect nearly 25 percent of the world's population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of us are familiar with recent breaches that have had an impact on customer information: Equifax, eBay, Home Depot, Whole Foods, Target, Verizon Wireless and Yahoo, to name a few. But there are many more that fly under the radar, andare no less disconcerting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The primary consequence to this new age of cyber-attacks is that individuals arethinking more seriouslyabout their online privacy. Consider the amount of data entered online daily, multiplied by millions of people: addresses, birthdates, credit card numbers, passwords, and so much more. And while more abstract cases (e.g., &quot;identity theft&quot;) only resonate withpeople who have experienced it closely, other cases about credit cards, or access todaily serviceshit closer to home. Consumers will want to know: How is my data being protected? And more important, how and why is it being used?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consumers aren't the only ones concerned. For years, governing bodies have enacted regulations to address data privacy. A few have begun to address the challenges of the burgeoning digital age, where so much data has been created so quickly that it's extremely difficult, if not impossible to control. How do you deal with this complexity without crippling businesses?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has received a great deal of attention lately, with the deadline for compliance by May 25, 2018. The GDPR broadens the scope of personal privacy laws to protect the data rights of EU residents, giving individuals greater control over who has their data, and how they will use it. It's an extension of data privacy laws that have been in existence for decades in Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At its heart, the GDPR is about data and how that data is protected. Many organizations have been caught flat-footed by the looming regulation. But it's not only compliance with the regulation that should be of concern to businesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Internet of things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) both involve personal data, and lots of it. Companies are exposed on several fronts. In this age of data awareness by consumers and the watchful eye of regulators, companies must proactively address important issues, such as user privacy, organizational transparency and data trust. And there's little time to waste. It's estimated that more than five million new devices are being connected to the Internet with the potential to reach more than 21 billion by 2020. As the number of devices grows, so does the threat for more breaches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Without a doubt, the GDPR has become a forcing factor for organizations to reevaluate and revamp their long-term data protection strategies. The good news is that in preparing for the GDPR, companies can simultaneously meet the growing data security issues brought about by the proliferation of data and new technology.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Data governance can serve as the foundation for GDPR compliance, while offering a framework that will help mitigate security issues brought forth by new, disruptive technologies. Data governance is an essential part of overall data security. It provides a framework for managing and defining enterprise-wide policies, business rules, and data assets to provide the necessary level of data protection and quality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is crucial in meeting specific requirements of the GDPR, such as &quot;~Privacy by Design,' which states that protection of personal data must become part of your organization's DNA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Specifically, data governance helps an organization answer three crucial questions specific to the GDPR, but they also apply to broader data security initiatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are:</SPAN></P>

<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How and why am I processing that data?&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With data governance, organizations gain clarity on what data they have and who owns it. This clarity makes it easier to report on data, a critical requirement of regulators. When you can find data, understand it, and trust it, you can provide the evidence that regulators need to prove compliance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GDPR has raised the stakes around data protection and data privacy, to be sure. But the surge from the data tsunami keeps rising. Forward-thinking companies must look beyond a 'one and done' mindset when it comes to data privacy and security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Data governance can't prevent breaches from happening, but it can help organizations fortify their data, and be prepared to handle risks as they arise.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) will force very strict new privacy compliance rules on firms doing business in the EU, but the startup with an atrocious company and product name has what it says is the solution to maintaining compliance.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cockroach Labs has introduced version 2.0 of its CockroachDB distributed database, which can be run in a data center or cloud. The company bills the product as &quot;the SQL database for global cloud services.&quot; It automatically scales, rebalances and repairs databases spread over multiple locations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Version 2.0 is aimed at companies moving to the cloud, which is increasingly constrained by laws governing the countries in which cloud data centers are located. One of CockroachDB's new features is something the company calls &quot;geo-partitioning of data&quot; for automating the process of storing data close to the customer. So, the data of German customers would reside in a German data center, and so on.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While it's meant to help keep latency down - so a person in Asia doesn't have to wait for data from an Amazon data center in the U.S., for instance - it also helps comply with GDPR. GDPR gives European consumers the power to control how their individual data is gathered and used. More importantly, it gives them the right to demand changes to their data, including its removal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CockroachDB 2.0 allows companies to move data across servers at the database, table, and individual row level, so it is possible to split a massive database by country of origin and create individual databases for each country, which would help comply with GDPR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Version 2.0 also adds native support for storing, indexing, and querying JSON data types. CockroachDB 2.0 uses a Postgres-compatible JSON implementation that it claims offers 10 times the throughput of the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Aurora database, with operators for doing in-place transformations and inverted indices to speed up queries on giant volumes of data. This eliminates having to map out the types of requests you want to process ahead of time. It also means zero downtime for making schema changes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Complete documentation of all the new features can be found on the Cockroach Labs website. CockroachDB 2.0 is available for download now.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reno-based analyst Synergy Research Group released a review of the 2017 cloud market on January 4th. The report, which estimated the total scope of the industry at $180 billion, gauged the year-over-year growth rate of infrastructure as a service (cloud hosting) and platform as a service (combined cloud hardware and software) at 47%. Such astronomical growth in the infrastructure of cloud is fueling growth of data centers. The extent to which cloud is becoming the new form of infrastructure cannot be overstated, with Cisco predicting 95% of data center traffic will be through cloud infrastructure by 2021.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other forces are at play as well. Here are some of the top trends that will dominate as the data center sector continues to expand, including a closer look at the transition to third-party infrastructure.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Geo-planning</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2018, geo-planning will be a key aspect of strategizing for IT executives - who will be prompted by regional and worldwide network access, location-specific workloads, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) from the European Union, and other factors, according to Gartner. The critical goal is not to be the owners of worldwide infrastructure but to instead create the infrastructure through strategic alliances with outside entities who also give them access to infrastructure support and integration with numerous networks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The use of converged and hyperconverged designs will rise</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Converged infrastructure (CI) and hyperconverged infrastructure (HCI) are geared toward solving difficulties surrounding scalability, management of data, and the isolation of silos of information. Beyond solving these issues, CI and HCI are also routes to flexibility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These technologies are being implemented in diverse settings and by a broadening spectrum of organizations, according to IDC's Eric Sheppard. The increase in converged systems &quot;is driven by products that are offering new levels of automation, tighter integration between technologies, and, in many cases, software-defined solutions based on scale-out architectures,&quot; added Sheppard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Next-gen IT creates new potential direction for data center managers</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the moves taking place within enterprises and the continuing emergence of cloud are central to discussion, it is next-generation approaches and systems that will be assessed by IT leaders for possible projects. These niche areas include robotics and genomics, self-driving cars and drones, cryptocurrency and blockchain, and the Internet of things (IoT).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There started to be more workloads launched in 2017 focused on AI. These projects are power- and storage-intensive. Another area that is currently becoming more prevalent is chemical and biological research performed through computation of data sets. Neither of these types of workloads were present just a few years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liquid cooling continues to gain in popularity</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Data centers have shied away from liquid cooling due to concern about potential spillage. Today, this method of cooling is becoming more credible: proponents say that water offers hundreds of times greater efficiency than air does and is well-suited for huge server chips that have as many as 32 cores. Data centers will still have a difficult time convincing their customers that this method is safe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Larger IT budgets</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the InformationWeek / Interop ITX State of Infrastructure Survey (released October 2017), just onein 20 IT decision-makers said that they thought their companies' expenses on computing infrastructure would be lower over the next 12 months than it was during the previous 12 months. The largest portion of respondents (45%) said that their budgets would be larger. Meanwhile, 30% of IT directors said their budgets would remain at their current levels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Transition of on-premise to colocation and cloud</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IT thought-leaders have, for some time, been obsessing over the move from on-premise data centers to cloud hosted environments - so this aspect of business may not seem to fit the notion of a trend. However, 2018 is the year that the transition of enterprise systems to external infrastructure providers is now upon us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Credit Suisse senior equity analyst Sami Badri, who is responsible for monitoring the data center industry, noted that there was a huge change occurring in the structural framework that forms the basis of IT systems. &quot;During this transition,&quot; he added (quoted in Data Center Frontier), &quot;there is a lot of opportunity for colo providers to take on a lot of workloads.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This evolution within infrastructure has been forecast by many parties for years, and numerous types of hosting services have grown incredibly. To return to the discussion of cloud above, it is interesting that 2016 was the year the revenue generated by cloud services became greater than the amount produced through sales of hardware and software to run cloud data centers; in 2017, cloud services were growing over three times faster than software and hardware for cloud servers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Enterprises are often slow to adopt technologies that are proving valuable to startups and other smaller entities; a more substantive conversion of enterprises to the cloud model was easy to see coming but has taken time. Expecting this increase in enterprise adoption is based on the figures from 2017, which showed a significant uptick in implementation within large organizations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not all infrastructure trends will make sense for your data center or your business. However, awareness of the above trends will help you understand how other firms are developing their data centers and handling their workloads, so you can best position your organization for the future.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the General Data Protection Regulation was first developed, I have been predicting that the call for personal data protections would expand beyond the companies directly impacted by GDPR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In early March - just a few weeks before the voter manipulation scandal surfaced - Information Management published an article of mine titled &quot;GDPR Violations - Hefty Fines or Broken Reputations; Which Is Worse?&quot; The premise was that as consumers start to see what GDPR compliance actually means - and by extension what noncompliance looks like - they will start expecting ALL companies they do business with to comply, regardless of whether those companies are legally obligated to do so or not. The consequences of noncompliance will be (at the very least) broken reputations and loss of customers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As it turns out, this prediction has been proven right much sooner and more strongly than expected. And the consequences appear to be more dire than anticipated. The reason: The personal data misuse scandal involving Facebook and Cambridge Analytica.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In one week, Facebook stock plunged by $70 billion; both the US House Commerce Committee and the UK Information Commissioner's Office are investigating; and the internet is flooded with advice on how to quit Facebook. All this comes well before the GDPR enforcement date of May 25, 2018.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Facebook is not technically required to comply with the GDPR for data on Americans residing in the US, several of its current policies fall significantly short of the upcoming GDPR protections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Right to be forgotten</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consumers have the right to be forgotten. This means that if asked, companies must erase all personal data, in their own databases and in the databases of any third parties to which information has passed. Not only does Facebook acknowledge the difficulty of deleting data once it leaves their platform, but it also places the onus on consumers to ensure erasure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the case of third-party apps accessed by a Facebook login (the cause of the current Facebook nightmare), consumers are given a user number and instructed to contact the app developer directly to delete any personal information collected from the Facebook platform. Under GDPR, Facebook would be directly responsible for the deletion of information from all databases, internal or external. The inability to accomplish this would be a clear violation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clear and unambiguous consent must be obtained for all personal data collected and used, and consumers have the right to ask what types of profiling is being done with their personal data. Facebook users who took the personality survey that initiated this data collection did not consent to having personal data used in a psychographic voter targeting model.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Worse, the survey also collected (legally according to Facebook policy) personal data of Facebook friends of survey takers. Meaning Cambridge Analytica obtained and used data from consumers who gave no permissions, explicit or implicit. Facebook has since reversed that particular loophole, but the damage is already done.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Policies like this would be an egregious violation of GDPR protections. In fact, the entire Facebook model of allowing third-party apps to collect users' personal data without gaining an understanding of how that data will be used (and transmitting that understanding back to the users) seems to violate the GDPR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Right to review and remediate</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GDPR provides consumers with the right to ask for copies of all personal data and also to demand remediation if the data is incorrect. This right also extends to data residing in third-party databases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook has no way of conforming to this provision today, although it is limiting the amount of data apps can receive and investigating apps that had access to data in the past. In a full-page ad placed in several major newspapers over the weekend, Facebook stated that it would be reminding users of which apps have access to large amounts of personal data so users could &quot;shut off the ones you don't want anymore.&quot; While this is a commendable first step, it does not comply with either review and remediate or the right to be forgotten.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bottom line? The outrage is significant enough that even Facebook expects to see changes in the laws around digital data. Mark Zuckerberg has said that it is not a question of whether there will be legislation, but rather what type. The strong and immediate reaction to this incident in both the US and the UK should serve as a warning shot for all companies collecting and using consumer personal data, digital data in particular.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Take a good hard look at the protections enacted by the GDPR, because like it or not, they will apply to you one day.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite months of publicity surrounding the General Data Protection Regulation, including the potential benefits of compliance, very few organizations are ready for the May 25 mandate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is the finding of one of the most recent studies to look at GDPR compliance,CGOC's Top Corporate Data Protection Challenges survey.Only 6 percent of organizations say they are fully ready for the new data privacy and data protection regulation even at this late stage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This means over the next several months, both before and after the implementation date, businesses will be scrambling to catch up.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you're one of these companies, it is essential you not fall into the trap of believing any of the following myths that have risen about the regulation - which can lead to overconfidence, poor risk assessments, wasted effort and ultimately noncompliance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Myth 1: GDPR does not apply to us. We are subject only to the laws of the country and state in which we are incorporated, or we don't store or process consumer information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The wide scope of the GDPR accounts for protecting personal data of residents in Europe being processed bycompanies that are not based in the EU or that don't do the processing in the EU. For example, a Brazilian company selling kitchen supplies to EU residents only from its website is still subject to the GDPR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Further, the regulationis not limited to consumers. It applies to all EU residents, including an organization's employees and business associates residing in the EU. Significantly, it also applies if a company is justmonitoring the behavior of individualsin the EU, such as a research firm, even if the data is not permanently stored.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Myth 2: A data controller or processor will pay horrendous fines for every infraction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First the good news. A fine is just the finalstep in a long processdesigned to understand the scope of an infringement by a controller or processor and how the organization allowed the infringement to happen. Not every violation will result in a fine, and not every fine will be based on the maximum amount.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now the bad news. A fine is only one of the corrective measures included in the GDPR to put pressure on controllers and processors to comply with the regulation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Myth 3: GDPR creates an EU-wide harmonized set of rules, so if we are compliant in one country we are compliant in all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was certainly the hope going into the process of creating the GDPR. Unfortunately, the member states did not agree on all aspects of the regulation. As a result,each member state can have special rules, and there are currently more than 70 of them - the most prominent related to the processing of employee data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Each member state also has its ownindependent public authorityresponsible for monitoring how the regulation is applied. Organizations operating in more than one EU country must understand each country's specific rules and have the flexibility in their technology and processes to comply with each.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Myth 4: We have consent processes in place so we are fully GDPR compliant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not true. Whileconsent is essentialin most cases, the regulation involves far more than complying with the consent requirement, such as theright to be forgotten,data protection by design and by default, andprotecting personal data being transferredoutside the EU.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Myth 5: We already comply with EU data transfer regulations, such as Privacy Shield, and we are located in a country with adequate security, so we are GDPR compliant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not true. While protectingpersonal data being transferredoutside the EU is essential, the regulation involves far more, such as theconsent requirement, theright to be forgotten, anddata protection by design and by default.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Myth 6: We are a certified processor or controller, or we are adhering to a code of conduct, so we must be complying fully with the GDPR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The purpose of acertificationfor processors and controllers or developing acode-of-conductfor them to follow was to create entities that could help organizations understand their requirements and that could track compliance. However, while certification makesdemonstrating complianceeasier and enables the market to identify certified organizations to do business with, it does not in any way ensure ongoing compliance or create immunity from an infringement should a breach occur.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Focusing on just one aspect of the GDPR or basing your compliance program on a superficial reading of articles about the regulation (yes, including this one!) is very dangerous. You must understand the full scope and applicability - and with time running out, consider turning to organizations such asIAPPand theCGOCthat can help you find the GDPR and information management resources you need to ensure your compliance program is on track.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As we wake up to the dawn of the fourth industrial revolution - think internet of things, machine learning and quantum computing - it's hard to comprehend the sheer scale and speed at which customer data is collated, analyzed and processed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But as data generation spirals, so too does the emergence of guidelines aimed at regulating the handling of sensitive customer information. Rightly so, almostfour-fifthsof U.S. internet users concerned about their privacy, and an even greater number fearing data breaches. With so many rules and regulations - arguably culminating in the forthcoming General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) - becoming compliant is just half the battle to surviving in today's data-driven marketplace.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, how can companies ensure they're leveraging the data revolution to optimize opportunities, while overcoming the challenges that lie ahead?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The need for robust data protection measures has been brewing for some time, and the absence of a federal data protection law across the U.S. has inevitably led to the development of several state-level initiatives. There are currently 21 proposed privacy bills across 11 states, causing a headache for national and international businesses as they navigate through a minefield of mandates to ensure they are demonstrating acceptable standards across the board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Early-bird California appears to be quick to the table, having enacted a security breach notification law back in 2002, as well as having a proposed ballot measure in the wings, namely, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, amid the hype, there is one overarching piece of legislation that cannot be ignored, as it will affect any state handling the data of EU citizens. As of May this year, the GDPR, designed primarily to synchronize privacy laws across Europe and provide greater control and protection for consumers, will also play a role in setting a benchmark for U.S. data privacy policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In becoming GDPR-compliant, companies can be confident their data handling processes are fit for purpose, while also being prepared for any federal law which may be in the offing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Embarking on a journey to compliance</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given the complexity of data protection legislation - the GDPR comprises no less than 99 articles - it can be hard to know where to start. So let's take a look at the key requirements for businesses to ensure their data is ready:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consider the three &quot;~rights' of the consumer</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The right to access (i.e. information on whether, how and for what purpose their personal details are being processed); the right to be forgotten (also known as data erasure, whereby companies have 72 hours to delete personal data once requested to do so); and the right to data portability (meaning details of data records should be supplied in a &quot;~commonly used, machine readable format').</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Establish explicit consent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If there's one takeaway from the new regulation, it's that customers must physically opt in and grant permission for a company to collect, store and process their data. This is important for record-keeping, as businesses will be responsible for supplying sufficient evidence to their local Data Protection Agency, if required, of the steps they have taken to obtain such consent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Communicate core objectives</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's time to update policies. It's not enough to just send a memo announcing a new policy without further explanation or scope for discussion. For both employees and external vendors, take the time to explain why the changes are being made, and invite feedback on how new policies can be implemented. This will motivate staff and business partners to be vigilant when handling customer data, and ultimately, prevent data security breaches, which may result in hefty fines for the business. Meanwhile, informing customers of enhancements to the company's data protection policy, via the website or other marketing channels, will demonstrate due diligence, building trust and loyalty in the process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Become experts in data handling</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the prospect of overhauling an existing privacy policy is daunting, consider building a team of in-house data protection experts to ensure data feeds are being monitored at all times. Larger companies will also need to appoint a Data Protection Officer, which can be an existing staff member.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Don't rewrite the rulebook</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the GDPR, implementation of &quot;~privacy by design' protocols and procedures applies only to future operations. If a company already has a robust system in place, which works well and is compliant, it doesn't necessarily need an overhaul.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Steer away from data silos</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The renewed focus on data and customer service in 2018 means that companies will need quick, easy access to their data at all times, preferably in the same place. This is especially important for larger companies, who, without the help of a centralized data warehouse, will struggle to connect datastreams from online and offline touchpoints along the path to purchase, and will therefore be unable to build a complete profile of each individual consumer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the help of machine learning technology, brands will be able to optimize marketing campaigns on the fly, experiment with programmatic ad placements, and deliver tailored messages across multiple channels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's easy to think of the GDPR as just another piece of legislation creating a mountain of red tape and confusion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">OPINION</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1075  words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Try to imagine life without software as a service (SaaS). It's really hard to do, given how much all of us -businesses, organizations and individuals &shy;- rely upon these cloud applications services nearly every day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The more dependent we have become upon SaaS apps, the more important it is to be aware of their liabilities. That was the point of this previous article. One of the areas I mentioned there - security, governance and compliance - deserves a closer look. Life without SaaS may be farfetched, but it's easy to picture at least one, in a landscape of many apps, being compromised or running afoul of rules and regulations.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are all CISOs now</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most users of Office 365 or SalesForce or Slack, or any other SaaS app, engage via the software to get their work done. But they also generally have control - and lot of control in some cases &shy;- over settings. Something that would have been previously handled by an IT Admin. They also might have influenced, or have even made, the decision to sign up for an app in the first place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In other words, in addition to using SaaS apps, end users have also assumed roles in assessing and administering them. This shows how the &quot;democratization of IT&quot; has not only put technology into more hands, but it has also expanded responsibilities. In many ways, we all need to be virtual CIOs now, if not virtual CISOs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the remainder of this article, I will raise some basic questions about the security of SaaS apps. In particular, authentication, encryption and administration. In a follow-up article, I will discuss the security profile of SaaS companies and more about their own infrastructure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Authentication options</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The SaaS security topic closest to end users is passwords and authentication, but the challenges are numerous. Users not only continue to be careless; they have reason to be confused. For example, it turns out the original rules around creating a secure password no longer apply. The man behind that standard now &quot;regrets wasting your time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Password managers can be a good way to create and manage long passwords, which are now recommended, although it does not inspire confidence to know that at least one leading provider of this service has been hacked. In any case, no one contends that passwords alone suffice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two-factor authentication (2FA) uses a second step, commonly sending a validation code to a separate device. But there is some debate about how best to implement this approach. The U.S. Government, for instance, discourages the use of SMS for authentication.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then there are additional factors, such as biometrics (see Windows Hello in Windows 10) or geographical markers, which can reinforce authentication and trigger alerts for anomalous log-in activity. Strong authentication is also associated with encrypted channels, hashed passwords, event monitoring and other advanced techniques.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So what kind of authentication does your SaaS provider use? Two or more factors? Do they enhance password security in other ways? How do they facilitate single-sign on (SSO), or federated authentication, to multiple applications?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Encrypting and protecting data</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another area of concern is what happens once you - and your data &shy;- are engaged with an app. So how does your SaaS provider handle data in-transit, in-use and at-rest?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Traditionally web companies have used secure socket layer (SSL) for communications. Actually, the IETF deprecated SSL in 2015, with Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.0 supplanting SSL 3.1, but the 'SSL' tag has stuck, often representing both standards. A website that has implemented these cryptographic protocols is marked Secure HTTPS (HTTP within SSL/TLS), which should be table stakes for any SaaS app.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If your SaaS provider is like many cloud-based companies, they could be using a multi-tenancy architecture, meaning that your data will most likely end up adjacent to someone else's data. What types of encryption are used and how granular are the controls? And then, whatever the architecture, how do they back up, replicate, store and restore your data?&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another set of issues concerns the type of data. The data breaches that receive most attention involve the release of Personally Identifiable Information (PII), a category that is increasingly subject to government regulation and receiving lots of attention with EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). So, in addition to encryption, how else is your SaaS provider preventing the loss of PII and sensitive data?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Admin, policies and governance</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The topic of data loss prevention (DLP) overlaps with the issue of user controls, because data can be exposed inadvertently through incorrect settings. End users can get started on most SaaS apps with minimal (or no) training, but given the potential for damage, that's quite possibly not a good practice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even if end users had to acquire the equivalent of a driver's license, it's always good to limit the potential for human error. Smarter apps - or management overlays - can be helpful in tagging and locking down PII.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Administrative roles are another issue with security and compliance implications. Limiting privileged access is a good general practice, but it's a special focus for GDPR. A well-architected app should also facilitate the adding and deleting of accounts. In that regard, you might see if your SaaS provider has leveraged the System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM), an open standard that automates the exchange of User IDs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A few final policy-related questions for your SaaS provider: Can they limit login to designated IP ranges aligning with your corporate network or VPN? Do they allow you to manage the app's availability on mobile devices? Are there adjustments for session timeout thresholds?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not just for cybersecurity ninjas</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While some of the questions above may seem basic, you never know. See this &quot;Taming the SaaS security wilderness&quot; by security manager &quot;Mattias Thurman&quot; (a pseudonym), who describes the &quot;nightmare&quot; of discovering the risky use of a highly insecure collaborative SaaS tool, a free app that had been introduced to the corporate network by one of his company's engineers, no less.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You might think that only cybersecurity ninjas can grasp what's key, but that's not true. One goal here should be demystifying the topic. It's in the interest of everyone &shy;- app makers, end users and third-party providers &shy;- to see that ownership in cloud application security is a holistic and ubiquitous responsibility.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK - Facebook is giving its privacy tools a makeover as it reels from criticisms over its data practices and faces tighter European regulations in the coming months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The changes won't affect Facebook's privacy policies or the types of data it gathers on users. But the company hopes its 2.2 billion users will have an easier time navigating its complex and often confusing privacy and security settings. Facebook says it also wants to give users a simpler way to access and download the data it collects on them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wednesday's announcement follows revelations that a Trump-affiliated consulting firm, Cambridge Analytica, got data on millions of Facebook users. That included information on friends of people who had downloaded a psychological quiz app, even though those friends hadn't given explicit consent to sharing. In addition, Facebook is also facing widespread criticism for collecting years of contact names, telephone numbers and call and text histories from Android users. The company has not said exactly what it used such data for or why it needed it. On Monday, the Federal Trade Commission said it is investigating Facebook over its privacy practices.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook's chief privacy officer, Erin Egan, said in a blog post that most of the privacy updates have been in the works for &quot;some time, but the events of the past several days underscore their importance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook also said it plans to update its privacy policy and terms of service in the coming weeks, but gave no further details.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company has tried over the years to simplify its privacy settings, yet the controls remain hard to find and use for many people. For example, Facebook announced in 2009 that it was consolidating six privacy pages and more than 30 settings on to a single privacy page.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet mobile users still had to go to nearly 20 different places to access all of their privacy controls. Now, Facebook says they will be accessible from a single place. Facebook says it is also adding &quot;clearer explanations&quot; about how its privacy controls work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chris Cox, Facebook's chief product officer, called the new settings &quot;the first of many steps&quot; the company is taking to address privacy concerns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook has been working on the changes in preparation for the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation, which were approved two years ago and take effect May 25. The rules are designed to make it easier for consumers to give and withdraw consent for the use of their data. They apply to any company that collects data on EU residents, no matter where it is based.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To comply with this, Facebook is adding a section called &quot;access your information,&quot; a secure way for users to manage data they've shared with the company, including status updates, comments and things they have searched for. That's where people can go to delete information or download a copy. While this download was already possible, it took some time to figure out how to do it. Cox said the changes let people browse through their information in detail, without having to download it. For example, users will now be able to look up a post from a specific date in the past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cox said that while the changes are &quot;in line with the principle of GDPR,&quot; there's also a &quot;bunch of stuff that goes above and beyond that.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c6">OPINION: Thousands of companies spy on you, not just Facebook</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1172  words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Editor's note: Bruce Schneier is the author of the book Data and Goliath: The Hidden Battles to Collect Your Data and Control Your World. The opinions expressed in this column are exclusive of its author. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (CNN) - After the Cambridge Analytica scandal, news and analysts have focused on what Facebook knows about us. It turns out that it is a lot. It collects information from our publications, our &quot;likes&quot;, our photos, the things we type and delete without publishing, the things we do when we are not on Facebook and even when we are not online. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Buy our information to other entities. In addition, you can infer other things: our sexual orientation, our political ideology, if we have a relationship, if we consume drugs and other personality traits ... even if we have not done the personality test that Cambridge Analytica developed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But for every article on Facebook's staggering stalking behavior, thousands of companies more long for relief that Facebook is under scrutiny, not them. Although Facebook is one of the largest entities in this space, there are thousands of companies that spy on us and manipulate us to earn money. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lee: Apple joins criticism against Facebook </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Shoshana Zuboff, a professor at the Harvard Business School, calls it &quot;surveillance capitalism.&quot; Although Facebook is chilling, the industry in general is more. It has existed in secret for too long and it is in the hands of legislators to force these companies to come to light so that we can all decide if we want society to work like this and what to do about it if not. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the United States there are between 2,500 and 4,000 information brokers whose business is to buy and sell our personal data. Last year, Equifax made headlines because some hackers stole personal data - including social security numbers, birth dates, addresses and driver's license numbers - from 150 million people. It is certain that you did not authorize the collection of any of these data. Equifax is one of those thousands of data brokers, of which you have probably not heard, who sell your personal data - without your knowledge or your consent - to whoever pays for them. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The capitalism of surveillance goes a little further. Companies like Facebook and Google offer you free services in exchange for your data. The surveillance of Google has not been news, but it is impressively intimate. We never lie to the search engines. Our interests and curiosities, our desires and our fears, our sexual desires and tendencies are collected and saved. To this we must add the websites that we visit and that Google tracks through its advertising network, our Gmail account, our movements in Google Maps and what it collects through our smartphones. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That phone is probably the most intimate surveillance device ever invented. Register our location constantly. He knows where we live, where we work, where we hang out. It's the first and last thing we check in the day, so he knows what time we get up and what time we go to bed. We all have one, so he knows who we sleep with. Uber has just used information of this kind to detect adventures of one night; Your phone provider and any application that allows you to know your location know much more. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> OPINION: I stopped using Facebook and everything has been fine </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The capitalism of surveillance is the engine of much of the internet. It is behind most of the &quot;free&quot; services and also of many of the paid ones. The goal is psychological manipulation in the form of personalized advertising to persuade you to buy something or do something like vote for adetermined candidate. Although the personalized manipulation of the Cambridge Analytica case seems abominable, it is not so different from what all companies want, in the end. That is why they collect all your personal data and that is why they are so valuable. Companies that understand them can use them against you. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> None of this is new. The press has reported on the capitalism of surveillance for years. In 2015, I wrote a book about it. In 2010, the Wall Street Journal published an award-winning two-year series, entitled What They Know, about how people are tracked online and offline. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The capitalism of surveillance is deeply rooted in our increasingly computerized society. If its true reach were to come to light, there would be generalized requirements to limit and regulate it. But since the sector operates mostly in secrecy and only exposes itself occasionally after a data leak or a research report, we almost always ignore how far it goes. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This could change soon. The European Union approved in 2016 the General Data Protection Standard (GDPR). The details of this law are too complex to explain here, but some of its provisions establish that personal data of European Union citizens can only be collected and stored for &quot;specific, explicit and lawful purposes&quot; and only with the express consent of the user. The consent can not be hidden in the terms and conditions nor can it be assumed even if the user has not accessed. This law will take effect in May and companies around the world are preparing for its implementation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lee: Zuckerberg will appear in the US Congress, according to media </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As almost all surveillance capitalism companies collect data on Europeans, this will expose the sector as nothing. This is just one example: in preparation for this law, PayPal discreetly published a list of more than 600 companies with which you could share your personal information. What will happen when all companies have to publish this information and explain how they use your personal data? We are about to discover it. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After this scandal, even Mark Zuckerberg said that his sector should be regulated, although he certainly does not want to implement the comprehensive regulations that the GDPR will take to Europe. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Is right. The capitalism of surveillance has operated without limits for too long. Because of the advances in the analysis of big data and artificial intelligence, the applications of tomorrow will be even more terrifying than today's. Regulation is the only solution. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The first step to implement any regulation is transparency. Who has our data? They are right? What do they do with them? Who are they sold to? How do they protect them? Can we erase them? I have no hope that the US Congress will approve a personal data protection law similar to the GDPR in the near future, but it is not unreasonable to demand laws that oblige these companies to be more transparent about their actions. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lee: The ABC to erase apps that know everything about you </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One of the reactions to the Cambridge Analytica scandal is that people are deleting their Facebook account. It is difficult to do well and it does not help at all with respect to the data that Facebook collects about people who do not use Facebook. But it is a beginning. The market can pressure these companies to spy on us less, but this can only be achieved if we force the sector out of hiding. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The controversy surrounding Facebook and Cambridge Analytica is triggering renewed debate over digital privacy in the United States and the potential for regulations around how tech companies collect and transfer data on consumers for commercial purposes.Facebook has been the subject of massive scrutiny for more than a week after it was revealed that Cambridge Analytica, a data firm tied to President Trump, used a quiz app on the platform to harvest data on 50 million users that it used for political ad targeting. Many of those users never consented to having their data collected.The revelations have become a scandal for the social media giant, which now faces a slew of investigations from federal and state officials. On Monday, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) publicly disclosed that it is investigating Facebook privacy practices amid charges the company may have violated a 2011 consent decree with the FTC.Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is reportedly prepared to testify before Congress on data privacy in April.Privacy advocates say the developments point to a broader issue: the lack of a single, comprehensive federal law in the U.S. governing consumer privacy online.Currently, the U.S. takes a patchwork approach to data privacy, with some laws instituting protections for certain kinds of personal data, such as the 1996 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, which added protections for sensitive medical information.Meanwhile, other countries have moved to implement much broader frameworks to protect consumer data. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The European Union (EU) is poised at the end of May to begin enforcing the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which requires businesses to protect data on its citizens even when they export that data outside of the EU.&quot;We have not put the proper restrictions in place to give users control,&quot; said Amie Stepanovich of Access Now, a digital privacy advocacy group. &quot;These are basic tenets of data protection that a good portion of the world has written in the law and the U.S. had lagged behind.&quot;On Sunday, Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) signaled the need for Congress to explore regulations around how tech companies handle consumer data following the controversy.&quot;All of these social media platform companies have said they have no responsibility for any of the content. I think we have to relook at that,&quot; Warner told NBC News.&quot;I think we have to relook at the fact that if you move from one company to another, maybe you should be able to move all your data,&quot; Warner said, later adding, &quot;I don't want to out-regulate these companies into oblivion.&quot;Warner, along with Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and other lawmakers, has already pushed for more rules around social media advertising disclosures after Facebook revealed last year that it unknowingly sold $100,000 in political ads to Russia-linked accounts before the 2016 presidential election.More regulations on how companies use and transfer consumer data for commercial purposes could have tremendous implications for tech companies, which have operated largely unchecked since their founding.The Cambridge Analytica saga has ignited a firestorm of concern because the Facebook users who participated in the survey app did not know their data would be used for political purposes. Facebook also says the research firm failed to delete the data after being notified in 2015, a violation of the social media giant's policies.&quot;To me it's a question of, how far afield can data about me go before I feel like I've lost control of [my data] online,&quot; said Nuala O'Connor, president of the Center for Democracy and Technology. &quot;People feel violated when their data is used in ways they didn't entirely expect.&quot;Facebook only publicly acknowledged the matter and suspended Cambridge Analytica in mid-March, as news reports of the controversy began to emerge.Mike Horning, a professor who researches social media companies, thinks that technology companies are at a make-or-break point because of the Cambridge Analytica scandal.&quot;If companies don't get serious about regulation themselves, or giving people more mechanisms to control what info they give away, I can see the need for federal regulation,&quot; Horning said.Some groups think that, while a better regulation system is necessary, conducting audits on data in a manner similar to how financial audits are done could provide the transparency that many companies currently provide.&quot;We have no idea what they're collecting and using, so to have independent auditors to go in and uncover that would be helpful,&quot; said Jamie Lee Williams, an attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a technology consumer advocacy group.Williams said that data auditing can help consumers make more educated choices about which applications they should give their information to in lieu of clear regulation or potentially unhelpful regulation.&quot;Sometimes the regulators don't understand how these platforms work, which can be counterproductive. Auditing could help. You don't need regulation for that,&quot; she said.But critics, such as Don Graham, a former Washington Post publisher and Facebook board member, make the case that any extra regulation of technology platforms will hurt more than it helps.&quot;Technology companies must move fast; regulation slows things down, sometimes drastically. Almost inevitably, this hurts a company's performance,&quot; Graham wrote in a Washington Post op-ed.If consumers get fed up with technology companies' data collection practices, he argued, then they can simply leave the platforms. These natural incentives and penalties guide them toward self-regulation.Still, Jennifer Daskal, an American University law professor, said there is &quot;broad-based consensus&quot; within the U.S., including within the tech sector, for more oversight and accountability of how companies use consumer data.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Any online search for information on General Data Protection Regulation opens a veritable Pandora's box of doomsday-scenario articles discussing high-cost and high-risk impacts to organizations, business leaders, and key stakeholders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rather than fearing GDPR, organizations should embrace the legislation and use it as a catalyst to improve information security strategies and to create a new path to future revenue growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Starting May 25, 2018, organizations that collect personal data on citizens of European Union (EU) countries will need to comply with strict new rules about the protection of personal data. Replacing the 1995 Data Protection Directive, GDPR eliminates the need for individual countries to establish their own data protection laws.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GDPR is one legislation that streamlines legislative efforts and creates a more efficient approach. However, GDPR also affects all global organizations that operate within the EU or handle EU citizens' data, even if headquartered outside of the EU, which opens these organizations to potentially substantial penalties if they fall out of compliance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The legislation might seem daunting at first, but it is a natural result of vast market and technological changes over the last 20-plus years. For example, when the Data Protection Directive launched in 1995, the internet was a 28.8K dial-up modem experience, personal computer desktop mass storage came in 500-megabyte hard drives, cellphones were analog, and people still used pagers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Data storage has obviously changed as well, with global data storage currently reaching more than 16 zettabytes (ZB) and an estimated 163ZB predicted by 2025. Times certainly have changed. How organizations mine and use increasing amounts of data has grown exponentially, and, perhaps most importantly, advances in technologies have soared since 1995, including cybercrime sophistication.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Strength Through Compliance</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this era of data-driven marketing, innovation, and business intelligence, personal and corporate data is now more crucial, more at risk, and more open to potential compromise than ever before. As organizations increasingly rely on data to drive business and beat industry challenges, how that data is stored, cleansed, and accessed for analysis and reporting should be a top priority. Moreover, cybercriminals thrive on data as well, so the risk of data breach is a constant challenge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Corporations can mitigate these risks by establishing information security road maps, internal controls, and performing internal and third-party security assessments. Yet, historically, individuals have been at the mercy of these corporate efforts and have had limited ability to mitigate risk to their own personal data, or even to have options for legal recourse after a breach occurs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many organizations have been slow to catch up to technological advances of cybercriminals, and many others find their efforts and abilities lacking, which leads to an overall increased risk for organizations, stakeholders, and consumers. As organizations begin meeting GDPR requirements, they have the opportunity to create more robust internal practices and more effective organizational security controls. In short, compliance with GDPR requirements actually strengthens the organization and creates a path to better store, control, analyze and access data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Increase Profits Through Data Quality</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GDPR will give individuals greater control and rights over their personal data. However, regulation will also incentivize organizations to create and implement GDPR-specific policies and programs, which can strengthen operational aspects and help create a more accurate knowledge base.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One aspect of GDPR causing concern within organizations is Article 17, or &quot;Right to erasure (right to be forgotten),&quot; which gives individuals the right to request the deletion or removal of personal data if no reason exists for its continued processing. While Article 17 initially seems challenging, businesses should look at the positive impact the rule could have on the quality of their data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cleaning up data can create a far more valuable and accurate data set. In the information age, this accuracy can translate to a higher return on investment and help organizations better interact with their vendors, clients, and market channels and lead to higher fiscal results for the business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Transform the Enterprise</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While organizations will likely experience growing pains as they scramble to meet GDPR requirements, these efforts hold tremendous potential value for businesses in all industries. Organizations already understand the correlation between accurate data and better market analysis, innovation, and business strategy. A clear path to substantial corporate and fiscal growth is revealed when organizations combine this growing understanding with greater levels of information security and appropriately balanced risk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By complying with GDPR requirements, organizations can realize that enterprise data management not only protects the data subject but also drives opportunity and sharpens corporate strategy.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tech companies of every stripe are staking their claim to the internet of things, and networking vendors like Aruba are no exception. But to hear co-founder and president Keerti Melkote tell it, his company's pitch might have a little more heat on it than others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aruba's IoT credentials are based on a relatively simple premise - by definition, IoT devices have to be on the network, and they're one of the bigger fish in that particular pool.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[ Find out how 5G wireless could change networking as we know it and how to deal with networking IoT. | Get regularly scheduled insights by signing up for Network World newsletters. ]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company has a lot of experience in onboarding devices - hard-won during the era of BYOD, covering provisioning, credentials, privilege levels and monitoring - which translates well to the world of IoT, particularly given the urgent need to secure those devices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Security for IoT is the number one issue right now,&quot; Melkote said in an interview. A lot of what makes up enterprise IoT - as opposed to consumer IoT or industrial IoT - is smart building tech, including physical security, lighting, HVAC and more. These are areas traditionally owned by the facilities section of a business, not IT.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What IT does is give them a network drop and say 'have at it,'&quot; said Melkote. &quot;That's about it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consequently, many of those devices are on the network, but aren't secured. &quot;A great target for a hacker,&quot; he noted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regulatory progress - in particular, the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation that's weeks away from taking full effect - is adding impetus to the company's drive toward better security and privacy controls, he says. GDPR requires businesses to protect the personal data included in transactions that take place inside the EU.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think GDPR will become a global thing. As a vendor we are accountable to GDPR issues, and that sets the bar. So now, I might as well go global with it,&quot; said Melkote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since Aruba has to do business in those jurisdictions, it'll comply with the applicable laws, so the effect of something like GDPR might be to improve IoT security conditions worldwide, not just in Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What that means for Aruba is that the company is going to have to use its existing expertise while learning new tricks, aided by corporate parent HPE. First on the list is adding deeper analysis capabilities to the company's repertoire, and doing it not in the data center, but at the edge, via more capable endpoints and hub devices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All these IoT devices are generating data of some sort - they're all sensors - and you want to crunch the data closer to the device in many cases, simply because it's controlling some equipment,&quot; Melkote said. &quot;When you're controlling, real-time responses become very important.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For consumer IoT, you don't need a lot of edge computing - smart home gizmos and the like are all essentially cloud front-ends. But it's a different story when you're talking about enterprise and industrial IoT applications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The IoT opportunity becomes an all-in infrastructure opportunity,&quot; Melkote said. &quot;You need to have the network, you need to have the compute, you need to have the storage. And then you need to have the software.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Melkote admitted that it's been a challenge to move into the IoT space, where a certain degree of specialist knowledge of a given vertical - successful medical IoT, for example, requires expertise in the medical technology field - but that partnerships have proven key to addressing this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These include partners in building controls, medical pumps, asset tracking, mobile communications and video distribution, among others.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LONDON - Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is promising to do a better job protecting user data following reports that a political consultant misused the personal information of millions of the company's subscribers. The fact is, European regulators are already forcing him to do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A similar data breach in the future could make Facebook liable for fines of more than $1.6 billion under the European Union's new General Data Protection Regulation, which will be enforced from May 25. The rules, approved two years ago, also make it easier for consumers to give and withdraw consent for the use of their data and apply to any company that uses the data of EU residents, no matter where it is based.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The law is the latest attempt by EU regulators to rein in mostly American tech giants who they blame for avoiding tax, stifling competition and encroaching on privacy rights. European analysts say GDPR is the most important change in data privacy regulation in a generation as they try to catch up with all the technological advances since 1995, when the last comprehensive European rules were put in place. The impact is likely to be felt across the Atlantic as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For those of us who hold out no hope that our government will stand up for our rights, we are grateful to Europe,&quot; said Siva Vaidhyanathan, a professor at the University of Virginia who studies technology and intellectual property. &quot;I have great hopes that GDPR will serve as a model for ensuring that citizens have dignity and autonomy in the digital economy. I wish we had the forethought to stand up for the citizen's rights in 1998 (the start of Google), but I'll settle for 2018.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. has generally taken a light touch approach to regulating internet companies, with concerns about stifling the technology-fed economic boom derailing President Barack Obama's 2012 proposal for a privacy bill of rights. But Europe has been more aggressive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EU authorities have in recent years taken aim at Google's dominance among internet search engines and demanded back taxes from Apple and Amazon. The European Court of Justice in 2014 recognized &quot;the right to be forgotten,&quot; allowing people to demand search engines remove information about them if they can prove there's no compelling reason for it to remain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now data protection is in the crosshairs of the 28-nation bloc, where history has made the right to privacy a fundamental guarantee. Nazi Germany's use of personal information to target Jews hasn't been forgotten, and the new Eastern European members have even fresher memories of spying and eavesdropping by their former communist governments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In today's world, digital commerce companies collect information on every website users visit and every video they like. This data is the lifeblood of social media sites that give users free access to their services in exchange for the right to use that intelligence to attract advertisers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Facebook scandal shows it can also be used for other purposes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A whistleblower this month alleged that Cambridge Analytica improperly harvested information from over 50 million Facebook accounts to help Donald Trump win the 2016 presidential election. News reports have focused on the relationship between Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix, former Trump strategist Steve Bannon and billionaire computer scientist Robert Mercer, who bankrolled the operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cambridge Analytica says none of the Facebook data was used in the Trump campaign. Facebook is investigating.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The regulation is trying to balance the power between ourselves as individuals and organizations that use that data for a whole variety of services,&quot; said David Reed, knowledge and strategy director at DataIQ, a London-based firm that provides research on data issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The EU's new rules expand the reach of regulations to cover any company that processes the data of people living in the bloc, regardless of where the company is based. Earlier rules were ambiguous on this point, and international companies took advantage of that to skirt some regulation, the EU says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Facebook is based in Menlo Park, California, it has some 277 million daily users in Europe out of 1.4 billion globally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The EU legislation also demands that consent forms are written in plain language anyone can understand. No more legalese across pages and pages of terms and conditions that few people read before clicking &quot;I Agree.&quot; The regulations also require that consent must be as easy to withdraw as it is to give.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To ensure compliance, there's the potential for big fines. Under GDPR, organizations face fines of up to $25 million or 4 percent of annual global turnover - whichever is greater - for the most serious violations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook reported $40.65 billion in revenue last year. That means a serious violation could cost the company as much as $1.63 billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sarah T. Roberts, a professor of information studies at UCLA, says the EU is formulating the rules of engagement rather than allowing internet companies to dictate. While U.S.-based platforms were created in the image of Silicon Valley, that type of bravado and no-holds barred capitalism doesn't go down well in Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Despite claims that cyberspace is not fettered to planet Earth, that is not true,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vol. 1</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">No. 1</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With only two months until the EU's General Data Protection Regulation goes into full effect, many organizations still seem to be slow-moving when it comes to compliance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, nearly one in four London businesses reported that they were unaware of the new data protection regulation with just weeks before the May 25 deadline, according to aLondon Chamber of Commerce and Industry(LCCI) survey. The survey also found that of the business decision-makers who are aware of and believe that GDPR will affect them, only 16 percent said their business is prepared for it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not only are these numbers significant, but so too are the consequences of failing to get on board. Until now, the EU's data protection standards and rules lacked the teeth to command compliance. But now, under GDPR, financial penalties for data protection violations are severe - \xE2,\xAC20 million (nearly $25 million USD) or 4 percent of annual global turnover (whichever is higher) to be exact. And it's not just EU-based businesses that GDPR affects, but any organization processing personal data of EU citizens.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While this all sounds ominous and complex, it doesn't have to be. Foundationally, GDPR compliance is about following sensible information management practices - something all businesses should be practicing - to secure and organize the heaps of customer data they collect. In fact, oftentimes the biggest obstacle for businesses is that employees do not follow their organization's information governance policies, whether it's because storing content in these platforms is onerous or simply due to ignorance of the rules.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To become GDPR-compliant before the looming deadline, here are seven practical steps to both improve employee awareness around proper data governance and the practices which make it more likely people will follow the rules.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Get Consumers' ConsentCompanies across industries are collecting more consumer data than ever before. Under GDPR, be clear about what information you're collecting, how it will be used, and have a legal document in place that clearly outlines both. Another option is to only collect data you need - if you don't need to know a person's gender for a specific reason, consider eliminating those prompts on your website.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. &quot;And Honor Their WishesAs part of the GDPR, &quot;~The Right to be Forgotten' will allow consumers to demand that an organization deletes any data they hold on them. In order to honor this, be sure that all personal information is moved to a central environment so it can be easily and thoroughly removed. Which leads to our next step:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Unify Your DataAim to store all personal customer data in one, central environment, or connect on-premises and cloud deployments. If this is not possible, make sure that departments have one single space for storing data. Eliminateshadow ITand train all staff to be compliant with these practices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Give Your Data a &quot;~Spring Cleaning'One of the easiest ways to begin complying with the GDPR is to perform an audit of all the information you currently hold and search for any personally identifiable information that may exist across your organization. Move what you want to keep to a central repository and delete the rest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Make Information Easy to Find As of May 2018, consumers will have the right to demand a &quot;~subject access request,' in which companies must be able to provide them with a file containing all the information you hold on them. To be compliant, you will need to confidently collect data from all your systems about a specific customer. This may involve collecting data from multiple systems, so have the technology and processes in place to do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Automate Records Management Personal customer information that your staff receives must be recorded centrally, have permissions and metadata tags applied and be destroyed when no longer required. Don't keep paper records, and implement strict, automated processes about how long you hold onto this information and when it's no longer needed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Last, But Not Least: Make Sure Information is Secure Under GDPR, companies must store any data they collect via internal systems in a secure platform. Assess your current cybersecurity measures, make sure basic security procedures such as encryption and password protection are in place and then promote security best practices amongst members of your organization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the looming GDPR deadline, it's important for organizations to start implementing practices that improve data management practices company-wide - and the time to do it is now.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GDPR covers all personal data your company stores on data subjects in the EU -&nbsp;whether or not your company has nexus in the EU. Personal data is defined as data that can be used to identify a person.&nbsp; It's similar to the concept of personally identifiable information (PII) that we have in the US, but it is broader. PII typically includes actual identifying elements like your name, social security number, and birthday, focusing mainly on the data required to fake your identity with a lender. Personal data includes what the US calls PII, plus any data that can be used to identify you in any way, which includes things as basic as an email address, online personality (e.g. twitter handle), or even the IP address where you transmitted a message from.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A data subject is the &quot;person&quot; to which the personal data applies. To be subject to the GPDR, the subject must be an EU citizen residing in the EU at the time the data was created. The location of the company or its headquarters is irrelevant.&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are several aspects of the GDPR, including the requirement of companies to act responsibly in gathering and storing personal data, including making sure that they collect only data necessary to do the task at hand.&nbsp; For example, if you don't need to store the data subject's IP address, don't store it. You must also privacy into account in all aspects of system design.&nbsp; The GDPR calls this Privacy by Design.&nbsp; Some companies will be required to appoint a data protection officer, or DPO. (In this context, data protection is more concerned about privacy than backup and recovery.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two requirements that data protection (i.e. backup, recovery, &amp; archive) people are likely to be concerned with is the requirement to (upon request) supply a data subject with all their personal data, and to delete all of it if they ask you to.&nbsp; (You may keep some data if you can demonstrate a legitimate business need for it.)&nbsp; The concern here is that the GDPR covers all personal data your company has on a subject, including any data in the backup or archive systems. (More on that later.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The good news</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The general opinion about the GDPR seems to be that it was written with companies like Google and Facebook in mind -&nbsp;companies that store a lot of personal data on people that are not employers, partners, or customers.&nbsp; (Remember, unless you are advertising on Facebook, you are not its customer; you are the product. The same is true on Google unless you're advertising on Google or using G-Suite; Gmail doesn't count.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As of this writing, the news about the harvest and misuse of Facebook data by Cambridge Analytica is at the top of many news feeds. This is exactly what the GDPR was written for.&nbsp; People that want to #deletefacebook now have a regulation that says they can tell Facebook to delete all history of their existence in Facebook, and Facebook will have to comply.&nbsp; Not complying will cost them even more dearly than this fiasco has already cost them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other good news is the following. Although the EU has been preparing for the GDPR for the last several years, a lot of companies don't seem quite ready for it to go into effect in May. In addition, a lot of vendors aren't sure how they're going to help their customers comply with the GDPR.&nbsp; So, if you're not ready, you're probably not alone - especially if you live in the US. US companies seem to just now being waking up to the realization they need to comply with the GDPR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are also provisions in the GDPR that give some hope.&nbsp; One provision talks about legitimate interests for personal data.&nbsp; So, if you can demonstrate a legitimate reason for a given set of data, it may be exempt from some of the GDPR requirements, like discovery and deletion. For example, a law enforcement organization certainly cannot be required to present data from an ongoing investigation that might compromise said investigation, and it cannot be required to delete all personal data on a subject just because he or she says so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is also a provision that talks about if things are &quot;technically possible.&quot;&nbsp; The courts may allow a defense that says, &quot;based on the products and services we use, it is not technically possible to satisfy that request at this time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The not-so-good news</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The key phrase in the last sentence in the previous paragraph is may. There is no case law yet.&nbsp; No one has any idea yet how the courts are going to interpret this new regulation.&nbsp; What are they going to consider a legitimate reason for keeping data?&nbsp; Investigation records like those mentioned previously are an easy one. What about purchase history of an existing customer?&nbsp; What about data related to those purchases?&nbsp; Do you really need to store the IP address a customer was using when they made a purchase?&nbsp; No one knows how the courts are going to rule on this yet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For now, this can be interpreted as &quot;semi-good&quot; news -- if you're not one of the types of companies that people believe are the big targets.&nbsp; It's a good chance the people at Google, Facebook, and the like are having many meetings about how to comply with these requirements from the beginning. So, this &quot;not-so-good news&quot; should not be taken to mean that you can sit on your haunches and wait for some case law before deciding what to do. If you haven't already done so, now is the time to start talking to your vendors about how you will comply with some of the more challenging aspects of this regulation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are a lot of companies advertising &quot;GDPR compliant&quot; products, or product that are &quot;GDPR certified.&quot;&nbsp; At this point there is no such thing as being GDPR certified.&nbsp; And no product is going to make you GDPR compliant. Complying with GDPR is as much about process and procedure as it is about the products you use. In fact, some would say even more so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The scary news</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One big question for data protection professionals is whether or not backups and archives are included when it says you have to delete a given data subject's personal data.&nbsp; If they are included, what's going to happen when you say to a data subject that it's not technically possible to delete a given subject's data out of the middle of a backup in the middle of a backup tape somewhere?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Are the courts going to interpret that as non-compliant and stick you with the huge fine of 4% of your annual revenue or 20 million Euros (whichever is greater)? If so, there will be very few companies that will compliant come May 25 because this requirement simply wasn't built into backup software design. Backups were meant to hold onto everything by design. Asking a backup system to selectively design stuff is like asking the proverbial scorpion to ride on the back of the turtle without stinging it -&nbsp;it goes against its very nature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If this is the first time you're reading about the GDPR, you've got some catching up to do.&nbsp; The good news is there is a lot of information available on the official GDPR website.&nbsp; Make sure you're familiar with everything there before you start reaching out to those who will try to sell you &quot;GDPR compliant&quot; products.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regarding the March 22 news article &quot;Facebook to audit thousands of apps for data security&quot;:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Facebook/Cambridge Analytica data debacle highlights the need for more comprehensive regulation of data usage and privacy in the United States. Europe is well ahead with the General Data Privacy Regulation (GDPR) coming into force in May. The interest in acquiring data in all fields will continue to grow significantly as computers and artificial intelligence programs become more sophisticated. The legal and regulatory framework governing data usage and transfers must keep pace if legitimate privacy concerns are to be met. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This issue goes well beyond concerns about identity theft and consumer preferences. As the Facebook/Cambridge Analytica case demonstrates, the issue also involves secondary uses of data that may have been transmitted for a legitimate purpose. One can easily imagine a world in which vast quantities of readily available data can be beneficial. This includes computers analyzing genetic profiles of large numbers of cancer patients to improve treatments. But free and easily transferrable data presents opportunities for malign uses and certainly ones that would not be agreeable to the individuals the data represents. Our legislators and regulators need to be prepared to devise and implement effective regulation to maximize the benefits of big data while minimizing unwanted and unintended uses. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">968  words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blockchain could be the answer to increasingly tough anti-money laundering (AML) statutes and enterprise fraud management (EFM) requirements looming for the financial services industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a&nbsp;report released this week by Forrester Research, blockchain's distributed ledger technology - because it is both secure and immutable - is ideal for meeting new government requirements and serving as a trusted repository for identification purposes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[ Related: The top 5 problems with blockchain ]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This makes it a trusted repository for providing device ID, known fraudster, transaction and other blacklists used in AML and EFM,&quot; Forrester said in the report. &quot;Updating these repositories will no longer be the privilege of AML and EFM vendors only. In addition to these existing vendors, new identity coin and social identity verification vendors and [financial institutions] themselves will be able to update crucial blacklists.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Governments are also considering using blockchain networks to secure sensitive data, but none as of yet have, according to Martha Bennett, a principal analyst at Forrester Research and co-author of the report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year, several new regulations will toughen requirements on financial services to ensure customer privacy and secure online and mobile payments. The new laws include the Revised Payment Service Directive (PSD2) and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Additionally, the Fifth European Union Anti-Money Laundering Directive (5AMLD), which is currently being negotiated, will likely increase oversight of virtual currencies, prepaid cards, information sharing and enhanced customer due diligence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Starting in May, GDPR will force European banks to rethink how they store, manage, use and disseminate personally identifiable information, according to the report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If they wish to partake in blockchain-based AML and EFM device, whitelist, and transactional data sharing, [financial institutions] must adapt their privacy policies and tools to be able to cope with this requirement,&quot; Forrester said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The research firm expects that privacy regulations and disclosures will have to cover blockchain-stored data assets as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;GDPR is one key requirement for handling [personally identifiable information] data securely,&quot; Andras Cser, a Forrester principal analyst and co-author of the report, said in via email. &quot;Encryption algorithm standardization and strength testing (FIPS, etc.) are also key steps here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fraud and money laundering cost billions</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year, the cost of retail fraud - everything from fraudulent transactions to fraudulent returns - amounted to 1.9% of revenue, up from 1.47% in 2016. With Forrester's estimate of $3.56 trillion in U.S. retail sales in 2017, fraud will cost U.S. merchants almost $68 billion. On top of that, the cost of detecting and preventing money laundering is steep, as are the fines for businesses that fail to do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2018, for example, Dutch Rabobank was fined $369 million by authorities for handling illicit funds. And last fall, a data breach at consumer credit reporting agency Equifax, resulted in 143 million records being stolen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Widespread availability of sensitive consumer information on the darknet and synthetic identity fraud - where criminals use stolen data combined with fake information to create credit and bank accounts - has proven traditional know-your-customer verification and knowledge-based authentication is unreliable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AML and EFM are harder than ever to enforce and need to rely on the most diverse data possible, Forrester said, adding that &quot;verifying identities before allowing them to transact helps avoid fraud losses in a complex payment ecosystem.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's where blockchain can be useful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because it is an immutable, auditable electronic record, blockchain ensures that transaction records contain artifacts and identifiers of previous transactions.&nbsp;&quot;This allows authorized investigators to backtrack transactions on the blockchain more easily than with current AML and EFM systems,&quot; Forrester said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blockchain implementations will challenge the monopoly of legacy identity verifiers - credit bureaus such as Equifax, Experian, RELX, and TransUnion, as well as watch list providers such as Dow Jones and World-Check - by providing auditable data for anti-money laundering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blockchain implementations for AML and EFM aren't expected to begin surfacing for another year to two in North America and for two to three years in other geographies, according to Cser.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Initially, enterprise blockchain networks will likely co-exist alongside more traditional AML and EFM tools, &quot;at least Initially,&quot; Cser said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The biggest issue is creating the regulatory, privacy and legal framework for [blockchain's] adoption in EFM and AML,&quot; Cser said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Forrester expects that existing and new data provider vendors, as well as banks and financial institutions, will be able to contribute to distributed and controlled blacklists/whitelists and privacy-controlled transaction repository blockchains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And, because blockchain is built on open-source software such as Ethereum, MultiChain, OpenChain and other iternations, it is less expensive to acquire a platform, while anyone can also view, audit and fix security flaws in blockchain implementations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Requirements for enterprise fraud management and anti-money laundering are similar in that it's &quot;all about looking for patterns, identifying known bad players, and performing investigations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The main difference is that, while AML has traditionally been batch-based and reactive, EFM in the past five years has largely turned proactive,&quot; the Forrester report said. &quot;Using real-time data in EFM is now a standard and critical requirement. EFM will use blockchain in risk-based authentication and account takeover detection as well as in back-end transaction (payment) monitoring.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The market for IoT security products is set to grow sharply, as the general IoT market becomes ever more ubiquitous, according to a report released this month by Gartner Research. While there are numerous drivers behind the increased demand for IoT security, a growing sense that regulatory compliance will shortly become an issue is one of the most pressing.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report lists security as the top barrier to success for IoT initiatives, according to a survey on IoT adoption conducted by Gartner. A big part of the problem, the report said, is that businesses often don't have full control over which devices and software are being used at each level of a given IoT project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[ For more on IoT see tips for securing IoT on your network, our list of the most powerful internet of things companies and learn about the industrial internet of things. | Get regularly scheduled insights by signing up for Network World newsletters. ]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This means that organizations will need a far greater degree of visibility into their networks than might previously have been strictly necessary, according to Gartner research director Ruggero Contu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We expect to see demand for tools and services aimed at improving discovery and asset management, software and hardware security assessment, and penetration testing,&quot; he said in a statement. &quot;In addition, organizations will look to increase their understanding of the implications of externalizing network connectivity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the report, $570 million of the $1.5 billion due to be spent next year on IoT security will go toward professional services, rather than endpoint security offerings or security gateways. That number will climb to a little over $2 billion by 2021, part of the $3.1 billion that Gartner says will be spent that year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regulatory issues might not be the prime mover behind IoT security spending this year, but 2019 and onward will see an increasing proportion of that spending driven by compliance with infrastructure protection and privacy regulations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One example of those new rules is the European General Data Protection Regulation, which takes effect on May 25 of this year. It will impose stiff fines and penalties on companies that do business in the EU - which is to say, most major tech firms - and don't comply with the GDPR's provisions. Those include the right for users to view data that companies store about them and clearer disclosures about what data is being collected for. Most relevant to the IoT is a provision called &quot;privacy by design,&quot; which requires that organizations &quot;implement appropriate technical and organizational measures ... in an effective way ... in order to meet the requirements of this Regulation and protect the rights of data subjects.&quot;</SPAN></P>

Morgan Chase is reportedly working on a spin-off of its main blockchain project in part to get a wider audience for it. The report, by the Financial Times, said the bank developed its blockchain technology called Quorum two years ago for clearing and settling derivatives and cross-border payments. A spin-off of Quorum would highlight the difficulties Wall Street firms often have after developing new technologies for the industry but failing to get much outside adoption as an in-house application.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As U.S. companies race to get their data handling practices in order to comply with the European Union'sGeneral Data Protection Rule, payments companies may be a step or two ahead of the pack - but that's not diminishing the amount of work to be done, nor the potential that many companies won't be ready.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GDPR takes hold May 25 in Europe, changing the way that global companies dealing with European consumers will handle or store their personal or payment data.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new rule essentially says the consumer &quot;owns&quot; that data and no one else can use it for any purpose without permission. U.S. companies inform American consumers that their data might be used for marketing or advertising purposes unless they advise otherwise, whereas the GDPR says the opposite.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under GDPR, nothing can happen with the European consumer's data unless they explicitly opt in. American consumers tend to ignore the fine print on company statements regarding the potential uses of their data, leading to an environment where companies expect them to opt in by default.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are a number of U.S. financial services companies that are vastly unprepared for what they need to do to comply with GDPR,&quot; said Julie Conroy, research director and fraud expert with Boston-based Aite Group. &quot;Some firms are all over this and ready to go, and some are only just now coming to the realization that they have an obligation if they are doing business with European citizens, and they are way behind.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Companies whose core business is data-focused and those with substantial European presences are generally well prepared, Conroy said. &quot;But there are many firms where business with European citizens is a more incidental part of their business, and I think a lot of those are quite unprepared,&quot; she added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GDPR calls for attention to detail in handling data, calling for companies to be able to tell an inquiring consumer, at any time, where his or her data is stored and why. Many security experts have said this will be a revealing facet of GDPR because many companies don't know the exact data trails they create.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it is all happening for a significant security reason, said JoAnn C. Stonier, who was recently namedMastercard's first chief data officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For us at Mastercard, security has always been part of our value proposition, but the GDPR and payments directives in Europe also place that value on security,&quot; Stonier said. &quot;From a security perspective, the GDPR has created the first comprehensive breach law in Europe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many facets of GDPR are cyber- and security-minded, Stonier said, especially the requirement that data sets undergopseudonymization, or the process of splitting up personal data, so that all of the information about a consumer can't be found in one place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As a method of data protection, that really removes identifiers to make it hard for the data to be traced back to an individual,&quot; Stonier said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Payments companies have systems and processes in place that put them in the forefront of understanding their data, where it goes, why it is moved, where it is stored and what it might be needed for in the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I can't speak for my peers, but Mastercard has looked at GDPR as an opportunity to look at how we are doing now and what we want to do in the future, and what needs to be done to comply with a law like this,&quot; Stonier said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a different standard for U.S. companies to comply with because it sets a high baseline that values data as a fundamental human right, Stonier added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it doesn't seem likely Mastercard and others will have to totally revamp procedures and processes just to adhere to standards concerning European customers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are not sure it will show up exactly the same in all markets,&quot; Stonier said. &quot;The baseline will be the same for us, because a lot of our products are created for a global marketplace and we don't recreate things, necessarily, in order to treat consumers in Europe differently than in other markets.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Online interactions are to become more stringent, especially regarding consent to use data in other manners. But most companies are viewing GDPR as a way to bolster what they feel is already a strong commitment to security in an era of constant cyber threats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, GDPR compliance makes for a better company, said Ron van Wezel, a senior analyst with Aite Group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The GDPR forces companies to include data protection and privacy into the design of their processes,&quot; van Wezel said. &quot;This not only reduces the systemic risk of a data breach, but also provides companies with the tools to manage consumer data in a centralized and transparent way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also paves the way for companies well-versed in data protection to move the bar even higher. Even though payments and financial services companies may not face major changes to privacy principles, their focus has to include helping clients and partners meet obligations and put together compliance frameworks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nothing is more important to Visa than trust and security,&quot; Visa said in a prepared statement. &quot;Safeguarding consumer data and ensuring trust are the cornerstones of our business.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, Visa is making enhancements and adjustments to its global privacy program to follow the framework GDPR provides. &quot;We are also engaging with our financial institution clients and other players in the payment services ecosystem to ensure consistency and alignment,&quot; Visa added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many companies are adjusting to the GDPR requirements through personnel changes and full inventory of data handling, including making sure that their vendors and partners are also GDPR compliant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Through GDPR readiness, we have appointed a data protection officer, completed an inventory of our processing activity records and revised our customer and partner contractual documents in order to ensure any required GDPR language is included,&quot; said Rob Grant, global acquiring risk leader for the payments processor Elavon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elavon is engaged in other GDPR processes, including training for employees and &quot;awareness across the business,&quot; Grant added. &quot;We are prepared and ready to meet the May deadline, and have implemented several changes across our business in Europe to meet the deadline and requirements.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ultimately, GDPR, which was originally drafted in 2012 and is finally being implemented this year, is delivering a significant request for companies across the globe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They are asking all of the companies in the chain of the digital world to be more accountable,&quot; Mastercard's Stonier said. &quot;It will take some time for all companies to be ready for that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Making it even more demanding, Stonier said, is the fast pace of technology.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The world has moved on since GDPR's first drafts,&quot; she added.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEWSANALYSIS</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">987  words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The wildfire growth of IoT is arguably the most important trend happening in technology today, but the ease with which bad actors can exploit its manifold security vulnerabilities has been demonstrated many times in just the past couple of years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the generally laissez-faire stance the U.S. takes toward regulating technology companies, the severity of the threat - IoT security issues affect healthcare, infrastructure, transportation and many other crucial parts of society - has some calling for regulation of the IoT.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hands-off approach</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given the speed at which technology, particularly around IoT, develops these days, from drawing board to prototype to production, plenty of people would argue that it's impossible for a regulatory regime to keep pace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to James Waldo, a professor at Harvard's Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences and that department's CTO, there's little hope for a set of regulations that evolves along with the technology.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The timescale by which regulation and legislation works is immensely different than the timescale that technology development works on,&quot; he said. &quot;The regulators tend to be reactive, and reactive to things that happened four or five years ago.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That being the case, the simplest way to address many of the most grievous harms that insecure IoT systems can inflict is at a basic engineering level - it's not unreasonable to expect devices produced today not to have unchangeable default passwords, nor to require them to be changed from the default by consumers once activated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevertheless, current culture in the technology sector - including many of the brand-new entrants that are part of the IoT market, which is projected to reach 45.4 billion Internet-connectable devices by 2021, according to IHS Markit - is to get products out the door and into customers' hands as quickly as possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This, of course, requires corners to be cut, and security is inevitably one of the first of those corners. Norman Sadeh, a professor of computer science at Carnegie Mellon University, said that the problem could well be exacerbated by the influx of new companies in the connected device market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;IoT devices ... aren't just going to come from sophisticated vendors, but might also be developed by two guys in a garage,&quot; he said. A couple of sensors, an Arduino or Raspberry Pi, and an IoT gadget is born.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Where we are now</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. has historically been hesitant to impose regulatory rules on businesses, particularly in the technology sector - witness the recent decisions rolling back the application of common carrier rules to ISPs - which means it's likely that any attempt to regulate IoT technology will be done with a soft touch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Congress has introduced several privacy protection bills, including H.R. 1324, the Securing IoT Act of 2017 earlier this month, but none have passed the preliminary stages of the legislative process. The most active part of the government on this issue has been the Federal Trade Commission, which has issued guidelines and best practices about IoT security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the FTC's ambit has always been limited, and Waldo noted that its mechanism for regulation is centered around fair-trade practices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They can ensure that a company follows its own privacy policy, but that privacy policy may be weak,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Big changes to U.S. consumer protection laws tend to be scandal-dependent, according to Waldo - things only change when something really awful happens, frequently to lawmakers or other powerful people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think that this is one of the reasons that Silicon Valley doesn't take regulation all that seriously - they'd rather get the stuff out, and once they do, the facts on the ground sort of overwhelm the regulators,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What the future might look like</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps the most useful contrast to the U.S.'s lack of regulatory attention to IoT security issues is Europe, where the General Data Protection Regulation has provoked howls of outrage from the tech industry, but won praise from privacy rights advocates. (It's set to take full effect May 25, and Computer World has a handy primer here.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GDPR, in essence, places the burden on companies to state clearly and up-front what types of user data will be gathered, and precisely what it will be used for. It also gives users the right to see data that has been collected about them, and to correct inaccuracies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's not wildly dissimilar to the most stringent data protection law currently on the books in the U.S. - the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, better known as HIPAA. According to Sadeh, a more broad-based privacy protection law in the U.S., designed to address the threats posed by IoT and other technologies that have badly outstripped existing regulations, could easily resemble HIPAA with greater scope.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That said, he's not expecting movement on that point anytime soon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think there would be a ton of resistance - I like many aspects of GDPR, personally I think that what they've done is great, it's also very ambitious and ambiguous,&quot; Sadeh said. &quot;It's good that they're doing what they're doing, and it's good that we're doing what we're doing here in the U.S.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the manifold headaches and dangers caused by a lack of uniform regulation around privacy world-wide, Sadeh suggested that the variable climates enable innovation. The difference allows for reflection on what different regulatory regimes will look like, and can help balance the interests of innovation with consumer protection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nailing down that balance will be central to any successful regulation of IoT, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a great space - don't get me wrong, I'm all for it, I teach it, I think there are tremendous opportunities here to make our cities smarter, make our health better,&quot; said Sadeh. &quot;But I think that there's a need for people to take more responsibility in making sure that we're not digging our own graves as we go through these technologies.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether it is from hackers or malicious ex-employees, it's commonly understood that one of the biggest threats to an organization's data is people. But unintentional insider threats can be equally as risky, and unfortunately they are very common - accounting for 30 percent of all data breaches in 2017.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given this, it's crucial that companies understand the many potential avenues of data misuse, and put plans in place to identify and prevent future breaches made by trusted insiders. To better understand the current risk from insider threats and what organizations can do to mitigate those risks, Information Management spoke with Mike MeKee, chief executive officer at insider threat management companyObserveIT.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Information Management: What employees (or types) are typically the most likely to be insider data security risks?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mike McKee: There are two types of employees who can put an organization's critical systems or information at risk: those with ill intent and na&iuml;ve users who unknowingly help attackers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Malicious attackers often set out to sabotage a company, committing intellectual property (IP) theft, espionage, and fraud. Inadvertent threats, on the other hand - which accounted for25 percent of data breaches in 2017- are those people who unknowingly put their organizations at risk through cases of human error, bad judgment, phishing, malware, unintentionally aiding and abetting, and stolen credentials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As far as types of employees, insider threats can include anyone close to a company who has authorized access to its critical information and systems. These can include former employees (i.e. those who have been resigned or terminated), privileged users such as IT teams and super users, knowledge workers such as analysts or developers, and trusted third parties such as vendors and contractors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IM: What types of data do they generally put at risk?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McKee: Whether intentional or not, insiders can pose a massive threat to any organization across industries. According toSANS, one-third of all organizations have faced an insider threat situation, and the truth be told, the rest probably just doesn't know it yet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When insiders misuse access, they can negatively affect the confidentiality and integrity of an organization by compromising company systems, as well as sensitive data, including employee or customer records, financial information, intellectual property, product details and more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also, when carried out by malicious internal parties, which according to IBM is the cause of31.5 percent of all cyberattacks, insider threats can go undetected for years. This not only provides unprecedented external access to organizational systems, but can result in millions of dollars in damage and remediation costs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IM: What are the top ways insiders can accidentally compromise company systems and data?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McKee: When it comes to insider threats, some of the most common ways people can accidentally compromise company data include:</SPAN></P>

Whether it's HIPPA, GDPR, PCI, SOX, NISPOM, or others, it's critical that employees accurately understand how the necessary frameworks apply to their roles. Otherwise, they may make costly mistakes that put their company at risk.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sloppy personal security: Unsecured devices are one of the most common causes of accidental insider threats. Without knowing it, employees often put their organizations at risk through brightly lit computer screens, shared flash drives, lost building keycards and more.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Using unapproved services: SaaS tools - such as cloud storage tools - are widely used in organizations, as they are help people more conveniently and efficiently complete their daily tasks. They, however, can be extremely unsafe and put companies at risk for massive data breaches.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
</LI><LI CLASS="c10"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"><NOBR>&bull;</NOBR></SPAN></P>
<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Forgetting to patch and upgrade: Not all employees regularly keep their devices updated and patched with the latest versions of software, as the process may slow them down in the middle of a work day. However, this can put their devices - and entire company - in danger, as hackers continue to identify new ways to access and override outdated systems, increasing the likelihood of malware attacks, phishing scams, and more.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IM: What can organizations do to mitigate these potential risks?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McKee: While there's no way to completely eliminate the chance of an accidental internal threat, there are steps organizations can take to drastically reduce the potential risks. One of the most effective ways can include conducting regular trainings, so employees are aware of all applicable regulations they need to follow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, organizations should share resources and send regular reminders, highlighting the steps employees can take to ensure their devices are well secured at all times, and outlining the tools they can use to properly store and share data. Finally, organizations should also invest in automated patching and upgrading technology platforms, which can ensure devices are adequately, protected at all times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IM: Is the problem of insider data security risks getting better, worse, or staying the same, and why so?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McKee: As technology continues to evolve, and both malicious and na&iuml;ve attackers are identifying new avenues to compromise company information, the risk of insider threats continues to rise. Today,60 percent of all cyber-attacksare carried out by insiders, according to IBM.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Further, Crowd Research Partners' 2017Threat Monitoring, Detection and Response reportfound that more than 50 percent of cybersecurity professionals reported growth in insider threats over the last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given these continued risks, it's crucial that organizations increase awareness among employees and invest in automated and behavior management solutions to detect, manage, and eliminate any potential threats.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vol. 1</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">No. 1</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Europe the move to open banking has been driven by regulations such as the revised Payment Services Directive PSD2 and General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which compel banks to open their core systems to allow customers to control and release their data to third parties delivering added-value services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In other territories with no regulatory imperative, the drive toward open banking is led by the desire to provide the best customer experience, with added value services, new business models and connected marketplace products from third parties and vice versa. To do this, the application programming interfaces of the bank will need to be open and connected to external providers. And cloud technologies will be fundamental in enabling this to become a reality.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moving beyond &quot;omnichannel&quot; or even &quot;optichannel,&quot; the adapter-survivor banks will be planning how to have presence and provide multiple points of contact with their customers whenever financial advice is needed. It is about having invisible &quot;digital advisors&quot; that work behind the scenes, accompanying the customer in their decision-making throughout their daily financial life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For this, technologies such as augmented reality, virtual and mixed reality, together with voice response will be fundamental.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cognitive technologies will work across the entire technology stack of the bank, boosting the entire range of services available to customers and maximizing internal efficiencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing and a large number of artificial intelligence disciplines will provide new opportunities to provide added value services for customers, providing additional support such as optimized custom products and other financial advice. The exploitation of the &quot;digital footprint&quot; generated by individual customers will allow banks to understand them even better, and provide hypercustomization of their portfolio of services and products to meet the needs of the individual customer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now that we are aware of the four main pillars of exponential banking, it is easy to imagine an example of a future customer journey within an adapter-survivor bank, which is fully aligned to meet the needs of their customers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As an illustration, consider &quot;Bob,&quot; who needs to buy a new refrigerator for his family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bob is a &quot;Bank 2020&quot; customer; he goes to the neighborhood store and opens his banking app and using the camera in his smartphone he photographs each of the shortlisted refrigerators that are in the store.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before the payment even takes place, Bob uses the screen of his smartphone to see the price of the refrigerator he is focusing on and can get a comparison of other refrigerator offers, all in real time. The goal is not to bypass the store owner and his merchandise entirely, but to provide the best possible deal to Bob.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bob can view comments online from other buyers in real time, to gain more insight that will help inform and support his purchase decision - information which supplements that provided by the retailer. Bob can also share details of the product he intends to buy with his family, friends or roommates, in order to instantly consider their views and opinions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the point of sale, Bob can request instant and customized financing in order to make the purchase, and can even visualize the impact of the immediate purchase on his long-term savings goals. This type of consultation can help Bob to understand his broader financial picture; for example, that he is perhaps buying above his means, or that if he decides to proceed, that he should cancel his vacation which is planned for five months' time, if he truly wants to buy the refrigerator today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bob can utilize his banking App to take a photo of the purchase invoice and link it to the credit card transaction; this allows him to have control over the manufacturer's or retailer warranty, enabling the bank to notify the customer &quot;X number of days&quot; before it expires and encouraging him to extend it. As part of the purchase process, the bank may already suggest to extend the cover or duration of the warranty for an additional fee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Post purchase, Bob can use inbuilt augmented banking functionality to select his refrigerator and understand the number of installments he has left until the refrigerator is fully paid off, at which point he may request an extension of credit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He can also review the expiry date of the current warranty and understand the energy consumption of the refrigerator, and its economic impact on his electricity bill. Bob can also provide his evaluation of the product in order to help other potential buyers of the product, perhaps earning some digital &quot;points&quot; for doing so. In case of any problems, he could use the app to arrange technical servicing and keep track of the number of repairs conducted, or even arrange to sell his refrigerator in future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These are examples of how a potential use case involving the purchase of a refrigerator could work in the future, shaped and driven by a bank that has embraced exponential banking. Throughout the &quot;user journey&quot; Bob is able to make different decisions without leaving the digital environment of his bank, whether through his mobile, his computer or a digital assistant such as Amazon Echo or Google Home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The example we have provided is just one of many digitally enhanced scenarios that can be imagined in the future, utilizing the components of the exponential banking approach. We are certain that the adapter-survivor banks that embrace this digital journey will be the brands that survive long into the future, shaping the future of digital retail banking and putting the customer back in control of his or her journey and relationship with their bank. The alternative for a bank is to be recorded in the unfortunate list of floundering relics; those banks whose long-term future is far from certain, if one exists at all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Exponential banking offers a successful blueprint for the existing mainstream banks to build their customer relationships while simultaneously fending off the advances of the &quot;digitally native&quot; challenger banks and other emerging fintech competitors who are seeking to take away parts of their business.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vol. 1</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">No. 1</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In only two months, the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation will go into effect. Companies around the world - in fact every company that holds any data about EU citizens -are scrambling to ensure they're prepared to meet requirements of the regulation and avoid enormous penalties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While avoiding financial penalties of up to 4% of annual turnover is clearly a strong incentive, preparing for GDPR doesn't have to be all burden and expense. In fact, GDPR offers an unprecedented opportunity for businesses to provide better data security and privacy services to their customers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No organization wants to be forced to adopt costly practices against their will and potentially face enormous fines if they fail to do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But whether the timing for stricter customer data protection is right for companies or not, GDPR and its fines are here. Companies are being forced to make these investments now, and it's in their interest to derive as much value to their own businesses as possible from these investments. And for most, doing the bare minimum to avoid penalties will not make the best use of the time and money they'll put into preparing for GDPR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fortunately, GDPR has a lot in it that customers and businesses should be happy about - requirements that will, in fact, enhance a company's security and data protection services. These requirements include:</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><UL CLASS="c9"><LI CLASS="c10"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"><NOBR>&bull;</NOBR></SPAN></P>
<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Article 7: Data can only be processed in ways the subject of the data consents to.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
</LI><LI CLASS="c10"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"><NOBR>&bull;</NOBR></SPAN></P>
<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Article 17: Data must be erased upon the request of the data subject.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
</LI><LI CLASS="c10"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"><NOBR>&bull;</NOBR></SPAN></P>
<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Article 25: Organizations must manage information in systems built with data privacy &quot;by design and default.&quot;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Each of these requirements arose due to consumer concerns about how their data was being collected, stored and used. Now, every company within the scope of GDPR's regulations has an opportunity to directly address these consumer concerns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Customer-centric data management</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GDPR's requirements make it very clear that EU citizens have very clear rights to their personal information. They can request information about its usage, and even request its erasure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While organizations have captured and preserved data for legitimate business purposes, GDPR pushes businesses to question the need for all of the personal data they collect, offering a prime opportunity for businesses to adopt a more customer-centric approach to data management.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What does customer-centric data management actually mean? The provisions of GDPR spell it out. Any data that is captured and stored by an organization pertaining to a specific individual must be only done for a clearly established business purpose, and a firm must respond to any inquiry from an EU citizen about how the data has been searched, processed or extracted to confirm that it was used for the purpose given when it was collected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, if an organization is subject to regulatory requirements to review employee communications, and that employee is an EU citizen, it must search, review, and potentially extract the information only for the purpose of meeting that regulatory obligation. While complying with the personal data privacy protections of GDPR may seem contrary to this, establishing processes and programs that safeguard personal data show that protection of data privacy is a top priority and will become a differentiator for many firms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The goal of GDPR is to make sure that EU citizen data is safe and within the control of those who manage or control it. Ensuring that individuals are willing to consent to their information being used for legitimate business purposes means not only complying with GDPR, but openly embracing the message that the organization will operate with complete transparency to defend what it has done with it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Waiting until an issue arises to fully adopt GDPR compliance practices will do little to instill confidence in those who must be willing to provide information that is needed to drive your business. However, embracing the customer-centric approach, even beyond what is currently required by regulation, will bolster the trust that truly drives their willingness to share data with organizations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To make the most of GDPR and reap the benefits of a customer-centric approach to data management, companies should:</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><UL CLASS="c9"><LI CLASS="c10"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"><NOBR>&bull;</NOBR></SPAN></P>
<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As part of the process of ensuring GDPR compliance, review the overall organizational approach to data management, and consider whether customer needs for control over their own data are being met.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
</LI><LI CLASS="c10"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"><NOBR>&bull;</NOBR></SPAN></P>
<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Take enhanced security and privacy practices beyond the confines of GDPR. After adoption, these practices can be of benefit to non-EU citizens as well, and companies should consider making them corporate policies that apply to all customers.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
</LI><LI CLASS="c10"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"><NOBR>&bull;</NOBR></SPAN></P>
<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Project the message that while complying with GDPR is an indicator of the importance placed on data privacy, and that the adoption of security and privacy practices is ultimately a core business value to manage privacy by design and default .&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vol. 1</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">No. 1</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">May 25th - the day that theGeneral Data Protection Regulationgoes into effect, forever impacting how companies manage personal data - is fast approaching. We already know that this regulation is arguably the most groundbreaking data privacy law to-date, going far beyond just the EU and affecting all companies that manage personal data about people residing in the EU - hence also being highly relevant for U.S.-based companies with an international presence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a now or never situation: business leaders must already have a plan in motion that ensures GDPR compliance. Yet, most companies are still fairly behind where they should be at the most foundational level - with onesurveyindicating that more than half of respondents say their organization is either &quot;not concerned about GDPR or are unaware of its relevance for their business.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For companies large and small, the road to GDPR compliance is a massive, complex undertaking. However, in order to move forward with any process, it's imperative to understand what the regulation is at its core - having the ability to store and process personal data securely, responsibly and lawfully. As a byproduct, it also provides the opportunity to reduce data processing costs and improve data analytics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GDPR compliance can be boiled down into a strategic five-step process that allows businesses to complete the shift tactfully. By breaking the end-to-end data lifecycle down into five stages within an enterprise application, it makes it possible to manage the data, systems and processes requiring change in a logical manner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let's dive into the specifics of this model.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Data collection</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To begin, all existing personal data (PD) must be identified, and the systems and processes surrounding that data must be logged for review and possible change. During this time, some PD may be deemed unnecessary and deleted; the remaining PD must be flagged as needing additional permission from the user.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Data storage</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Next, look at the systems used to store PD. These must be updated to include several factors, including fields which relate to the &quot;~purpose' for holding the data, legal grounds for processing, processing dates, and actions which could (and in some cases, could not) be performed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is vital that any data stored should be protected by GDPR compliant protocols for general data security aspects including access control, storage security and data backup, as it is imperative that these are sufficient for the purposes of GDPR compliance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Data recall</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Businesses must be prepared to provide detailed reports to any individuals whose data lives in the system, upon their request. This includes rationale behind why the data is being held, where it's being used and how much storage time is left on each item.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Designing and writing these reports is not the complex part; rather, the challenge is ensuring all personal data is stored and tagged correctly. Getting this right requires a critical look at the company's data collection and storage processes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Data maintenance</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's critical that data maintenance processes are considered for all individuals who have data within the system, in order to maintain their records. A way to ensure this is to allow internal subjects to update their data on their own using self service, and for updated processes to allow external subjects the ability to have their data updated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Data processing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Data should be processed in accordance with the legal grounds set out in the GDPR, and in compliance with the wishes of the data owner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ensuring data collected is only used for the purposes given requires changes to processes that involve accessing data prior to taking an action, such as e-mailing or calling a data subject. This requires extra data about allowable actions to be collected and stored which ensures automated processes only pick up compliant data for complaint actions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Assembling documentation is one of the most significant challenges for organizations' GDPR compliance. Also of significance, and a change from previous data protection legislation, is the inclusion of the right of the data subject to withdraw their consent and furthermore have their personal information removed (known as the &quot;right to be forgotten&quot;). Under this provision, individuals are allowed to request the removal of their personal data when there is no compelling justification for its continued processing by a company. Therefore, these processes must be adjusted to record consent from the user for processing, or one of the other lawful grounds for processing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reaching the end goal</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To lead the charge, major Silicon Valley giants are working to ensure all GDPR-compliance steps are as transparent as possible for users. For instance,Google created a privacy dashboardto help show what PD is held,Microsoft implemented a new data collection viewerfor Windows 10 that holds a similar purpose, andFacebook announced a new privacy centerthat holds all core privacy settings in one place to help keep these processes transparent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regardless of size, all enterprises need to implement a noticeable shift, fundamentally understanding the role of their organization with respect to data controller and/or data processor responsibilities in order to ensure they're going about compliance correctly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With refreshed processes, clean data and lower volumes, data processing costs are reduced, and data analytics are more effective.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether it is from hackers or malicious ex-employees, it's commonly understood that one of the biggest threats to an organization's data is people. But unintentional insider threats can be equally as risky, and unfortunately they are very common - accounting for 30 percent of all data breaches in 2017.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given this, it's crucial that companies understand the many potential avenues of data misuse, and put plans in place to identify and prevent future breaches made by trusted insiders. To better understand the current risk from insider threats and what organizations can do to mitigate those risks, Information Management spoke with Mike MeKee, chief executive officer at insider threat management companyObserveIT.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Information Management: What employees (or types) are typically the most likely to be insider data security risks?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mike McKee: There are two types of employees who can put an organization's critical systems or information at risk: those with ill intent and na&iuml;ve users who unknowingly help attackers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Malicious attackers often set out to sabotage a company, committing intellectual property (IP) theft, espionage, and fraud. Inadvertent threats, on the other hand - which accounted for25 percent of data breaches in 2017- are those people who unknowingly put their organizations at risk through cases of human error, bad judgment, phishing, malware, unintentionally aiding and abetting, and stolen credentials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As far as types of employees, insider threats can include anyone close to a company who has authorized access to its critical information and systems. These can include former employees (i.e. those who have been resigned or terminated), privileged users such as IT teams and super users, knowledge workers such as analysts or developers, and trusted third parties such as vendors and contractors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IM: What types of data do they generally put at risk?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McKee: Whether intentional or not, insiders can pose a massive threat to any organization across industries. According toSANS, one-third of all organizations have faced an insider threat situation, and the truth be told, the rest probably just doesn't know it yet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When insiders misuse access, they can negatively affect the confidentiality and integrity of an organization by compromising company systems, as well as sensitive data, including employee or customer records, financial information, intellectual property, product details and more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also, when carried out by malicious internal parties, which according to IBM is the cause of31.5 percent of all cyberattacks, insider threats can go undetected for years. This not only provides unprecedented external access to organizational systems, but can result in millions of dollars in damage and remediation costs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">See AlsoNearly all firms found vulnerable to insider data security threats</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IM: What are the top ways insiders can accidentally compromise company systems and data?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McKee: When it comes to insider threats, some of the most common ways people can accidentally compromise company data include:</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><UL CLASS="c9"><LI CLASS="c10"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"><NOBR>&bull;</NOBR></SPAN></P>
<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Misunderstanding regulations: Every company must comply to a unique set of laws, commonplace mandates, and regulatory requirements. Whether it's HIPPA, GDPR, PCI, SOX, NISPOM, or others, it's critical that employees accurately understand how the necessary frameworks apply to their roles. Otherwise, they may make costly mistakes that put their company at risk.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
</LI><LI CLASS="c10"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"><NOBR>&bull;</NOBR></SPAN></P>
<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sloppy personal security: Unsecured devices are one of the most common causes of accidental insider threats. Without knowing it, employees often put their organizations at risk through brightly lit computer screens, shared flash drives, lost building keycards and more.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
</LI><LI CLASS="c10"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"><NOBR>&bull;</NOBR></SPAN></P>
<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Using unapproved services: SaaS tools - such as cloud storage tools - are widely used in organizations, as they are help people more conveniently and efficiently complete their daily tasks. They, however, can be extremely unsafe and put companies at risk for massive data breaches.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
</LI><LI CLASS="c10"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"><NOBR>&bull;</NOBR></SPAN></P>
<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Forgetting to patch and upgrade: Not all employees regularly keep their devices updated and patched with the latest versions of software, as the process may slow them down in the middle of a work day. However, this can put their devices - and entire company - in danger, as hackers continue to identify new ways to access and override outdated systems, increasing the likelihood of malware attacks, phishing scams, and more.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IM: What can organizations do to mitigate these potential risks?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McKee: While there's no way to completely eliminate the chance of an accidental internal threat, there are steps organizations can take to drastically reduce the potential risks. One of the most effective ways can include conducting regular trainings, so employees are aware of all applicable regulations they need to follow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, organizations should share resources and send regular reminders, highlighting the steps employees can take to ensure their devices are well secured at all times, and outlining the tools they can use to properly store and share data. Finally, organizations should also invest in automated patching and upgrading technology platforms, which can ensure devices are adequately, protected at all times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IM: Is the problem of insider data security risks getting better, worse, or staying the same, and why so?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McKee: As technology continues to evolve, and both malicious and na&iuml;ve attackers are identifying new avenues to compromise company information, the risk of insider threats continues to rise. Today,60 percent of all cyber-attacksare carried out by insiders, according to IBM.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Further, Crowd Research Partners' 2017Threat Monitoring, Detection and Response reportfound that more than 50 percent of cybersecurity professionals reported growth in insider threats over the last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given these continued risks, it's crucial that organizations increase awareness among employees and invest in automated and behavior management solutions to detect, manage, and eliminate any potential threats.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Greetings, Daily Dealers. What to make of President Trump's executive order blocking Broadcom's bid for Qualcomm? It raises more questions than it answers, apart from the obvious outcome of creating a perimeter around Qualcomm. The immediate concern here wasn't about sensitive U.S. assets being placed in the hands of China, a no-go for Cfius even before Trump took office, or for that matter Singapore, where Broadcom is based, since it was about to become a U.S. firm. Instead, the administration evidently feared that Qualcomm's R&amp;D would shrink under the leadership of Broadcom CEO Hock Tan, as Ron Orol notes below. But what does that suggest about prospects even for consolidation among U.S. companies that promises cost synergies? Blocking deals with that goal in mind leads not just to protectionism but to mercantilism and outright industrial policy, which has been out of fashion for decades and raises the specter of heavy-handed government intervention in the domestic as well as foreign market for deals. We'll have more to say on that later today.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the other hand, an EY survey suggests that Trump's main legislative accomplishment, corporate tax cuts, will http://www.ey.com/us/en/newsroom/news-releases/news-ey-survey-finds-savings-from-us-tax-reform-spurs-reinvestment-through-research-and-development-and-mergers-and-acquisitions|lead to more dealmaking as well as R&amp;D.The survey found that 73% of executives are likely to accelerate M&amp;A strategies, with 94% of respondents planning to pursue transactions under $1 billion.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's widely recognized today that data is a strategic asset, and perhaps the most important asset an enterprise has available to it. With growing amounts data, organizations can either capitalize on, or forfeit, strategic opportunities to deliver greater value to customers, improve operational efficiencies and gain competitive advantages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As chief data officers and data scientists play more prominent roles in developing data strategies in many enterprises, we see organizations struggling to contend with these challenges and taking a shortsighted &quot;~save it now, worry about it later' approach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These situations are worsening as data becomes more active and distributed across an enterprise, with many groups and individuals implementing unique and/or customized data management and storage solutions that often begin as unmanaged &quot;~aaS' (as a service) projects and evolve into critical production systems with challenging data governance, security, access and cost management dynamics. Organizations that invest in developing and implementing a strategic data plan are fundamentally better prepared to anticipate, manage and capitalize on the increasing challenges and possibilities of data.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Data Strategy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are many things to consider in developing a data strategy such as the organization's objectives, environment, clients, applications, infrastructure, management, security requirements, budgets and resources. However, strictly as it relates to data, the priority should be to first define the following parameters:</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><UL CLASS="c9"><LI CLASS="c10"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"><NOBR>&bull;</NOBR></SPAN></P>
<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The right retention duration for every type of data.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
</LI><LI CLASS="c10"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"><NOBR>&bull;</NOBR></SPAN></P>

</DIV>
</LI><LI CLASS="c10"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"><NOBR>&bull;</NOBR></SPAN></P>
<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The capacity and performance scalability requirements for present-day and future applications.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As it relates to data retention, requirements can be difficult to determine and administer. Data captured today may become invaluable years from now, especially with accelerating advancements and widespread applications in analytics and machine learning. Therefore, developing a &quot;~data forever' strategy where some data is indefinitely preserved may be required.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Identifying when specific stakeholders require greater access to and more control of the data is also a priority. In addition, it's also important to define the ingest and egress performance, capacity and access requirements over time for the many types of data in an organization to ensure data storage architectures meet both today's and tomorrow's needs of the business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The areas of the data strategy that require specific consideration include: (1) archival; (2) backup &amp; recovery; (3) analytics; and (4) security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Archival</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Archives may be needed for audits, legal inquiries, long-term digital asset preservation, future use and mining, machine learning, monetization and more. Key considerations in archive are the cost of storage, preserving the bit-level integrity of the data, and ensuring that the data is both secure and accessible over many years of preservation. Many companies are moving away from using tape for archives to overcome its data durability and access limitations.Scalable disk-based archive systemsshould be considered to ensure the highest levels of ongoing data integrity and access performance for archive data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Backup &amp; Recovery</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The need to restore data can arise for many reasons including unexpected infrastructure and site outages, unintended deletions, and the increase in malware that can quickly render critical data unreadable. Malicious ransomware, in particular, can suddenly present an immediate threat to an organization's ability to produce and deliver products and services, bringing global enterprises to a standstill overnight. Recovery from such an attack often involves restoring hundreds or even thousands of servers in parallel, as quickly as possible. Disk-based backup systems located in proximity to server pools can significantly accelerate the restoration of data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Analytics</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Extracting insight and value from data through algorithms and intelligent queries also needs to be a core part of the data strategy. The recent rate and scale at which companies can capture, store and analyze vast amounts of real-time data relating to all facets of their operations and customer activities has fundamentally transformed how organizations learn, adapt, improve and compete.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This digital transformation that combines big data and enterprise-scale analytics enables decisions to be made faster, with greater accuracy, and with real-time feedback on results. Data analytic strategies must align with how and where data is generated and captured, where it is processed and analyzed, and how it is distributed and stored across an enterprise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Security</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As an example, the European Union (EU) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) becomes enforceable in May 2018, and with it, organizations can face significant compliance penalties. These types of data regulations can force organizations to understand their data privacy risks and take the appropriate measures to reduce the unauthorized disclosure of consumers' private information. Data strategies must consider and deploy technologies, as well as secure processes, such as comprehensive threat detection and intrusion prevention, strict user authentication and access controls, data encryption, data immutability, and secure erase features, to build a comprehensive data secure environment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Premises, Off Premises or Hybrid?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today's organizations face choices and tradeoffs for where and how they deploy their applications and IT infrastructure, including the use of traditional IT, private cloud and public cloud models deployed either on- or off-premises in private data centers, co-location (colo) facilities, or distributed cloud data centers. Many organizations are choosing a hybrid approach that combines traditional IT resources with private and public cloud models.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hybrid cloud modelscan provide fast and flexible development and deployment options with public cloud services for contemporary applications, while retaining the security features, management control and predictable economics of private infrastructure for certain workloads, applications and use cases. It also allows organizations to flexibly choose the best IT infrastructure for each element and aspect of their application workflows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Data strategies in a hybrid cloud model must contemplate and balance several considerations in determining the best approach for each organization, for each type of data. And, though relatively new, their complexity is increasing as organizations expand into multiple clouds while also seeking to maintain control and address security and cost concerns. Interoperability between various clouds is also a concern as a wide variety of API interfaces are orchestrated and provisioned differently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other factors to consider include the prohibitive costs and complex licensing associated with significant data movement between cloud environments. Western Digital has developed a hybrid cloud corporate data strategy that mitigates many of these concerns by maintaining a complete copy of our data on-premises in scalable object storage systems, reducing costs and data movement, to and from the cloud, while ensuring a secure and durable archive, and a fast, local backup/recovery solution across our global enterprise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A comprehensive data strategy is essential in determining an organization's capabilities, agility and preparedness in managing risks, as well as its efficiency and competitiveness in rapidly changing markets. Aligning your data strategy with the objectives of the organization is key, with focus on your unique data retention, access and cost/capacity/performance requirements - both for today's needs as well as scaling to meet future needs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attention should also be given to the core functions of a data strategy -- archive, recovery, analytics and security.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In today's heated economy, hiring has become an almost life-or-death proposition, intended to future-proof companies by seeking out and snagging the smartest, most creative, best-suited candidates available. Background checks-scanning credit reports, studying employment histories, and sifting through criminal records-can improve the hiring process by providing specific, sometimes legally required, scrutiny and bringing critical decision points to bear.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A new partnership between HCM vendor Ultimate Software and First Advantage, which claims to be &quot;the world's largest background screening firm,&quot; will make it easier for potential customers to use the HCM system and the background checking service together in an integrated manner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First Advantage has joined Ultimate's UltiPro developer network, where Ultimate makes available a toolset of application programming interfaces (APIs) that lets third parties create links to its UltiPro suite of human resource applications, delivered in the software-as-a-service model, which includes payroll, recruiting, onboarding, talent management, and time management.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ultimate is a major player in HR technology, having scored in the &quot;leader&quot; category in Nucleus Research's most recent &quot;HCM Technology Value Matrix&quot; market analysis. &quot;But the last thing they want to do is create a background-checking system,&quot; points out Raj Chopra, senior VP of global business development for First Advantage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, his company's use of Ultimate's toolset provides that additional functionality, and tight integration is the key. During the candidate process, the hiring manager employs the HCM suite's recruiting module. &quot;But when it comes time to put an offer out,&quot; the application &quot;enlists&quot; First Advantage's background research capabilities, Chopra explains. That way the hiring group is &quot;not re-inputting data they've already entered in the application,&quot; he says, which makes the research process &quot;totally seamless-it updates in real time.&quot; Such tight integration lets organizations &quot;get candidates on board and get them hired&quot; as quickly as possible, he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First Advantage already has partnerships with SAP SuccessFactors and Workday. And it's a process. &quot;I'm always looking to improve our integrations with our partners,&quot; Chopra notes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The relationship with Ultimate involves First Advantage's most recent iteration of its technology service, called Direct Advantage. It features mobile capability on both sides of the backgrounding equation, providing an easy and intuitive interface for candidates to enter their data on their smartphones, as well as the capability for executives to receive background reports on their smartphones-if allowed by their companies. &quot;Some corporate policies don't want this info sitting on CHROs' phones,&quot; says Chopra.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, First Advantage is scrupulous in handling personally identifiable information, Chopra maintains. For example, PII &quot;never hits our partners servers,&quot; he says. And such data is &quot;very much protected in how we pass it through&quot; to the client.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scrupulousness may be another reason why top HR tech firms are partnering with third-party background services. Recent privacy rules, such as theEuropean Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and, in the U.</SPAN></P>

<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Enact a new data agreement with your existing cloud apps concerning personal data.

<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ensure that you and the apps you use are only collecting &quot;~necessary' data.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The European Union's data protection regulation, known as GDPR, is set to go into effect. While many businesses in the EU have been readying themselves for this regulation change, U.S. businesses that provide payments and other services in the EU may not be as prepared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GDPR, which goes into effect on May 25, governs the collection of personal data or behavioral information from people who are in the EU. Given the global and virtual nature of business in the internet era, it is often difficult to establish where a customer or potential customer resides at the point that they consume the service. It is this that makes the GDPR applicable to American businesses.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The purpose of the GDPR is to force businesses to be transparent and careful while processing personal information when providing services in the EU, regardless of where the information is processed or whether the data subject is a citizen. The type of information protected under this legislation is broad: identity, contact, banking, medical, employment, education. The definition of processing is also broad - anything from collecting, storing, using and sharing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A research report released by the cybersecurity specialistTrend Microin September shows that 95% of global business leaders surveyed know they need to comply with the GDPR. Worryingly, however, the analyst houseGartner Inc.is predicting that fewer than half of businesses will be fully compliant with the GDPR by the end of 2018.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reason for this low level of compliance? Executives are unaware that even if the business is located in the U.S., it's where the service is delivered that determines this regulation applies. They may also be unclear on what personally identifiable information needs to be protected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, 64% of those surveyed by Trend Micro were unaware that date of birth constitutes personally identifiable information. A further 42% wouldn't classify email marketing databases, 32% physical addresses and 21% a customer's email address, as protected information. All of these are personal identifiers and failure to protect them could result in a fine of up to 4% of annual global turnover or $24.4 million (\xE2,\xAC20 million), whichever is the larger, for breaching the regulations in the GDPR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If your business sends email marketing communications that may result in a service being delivered in the EU, then the safest approach is to plan as if the GDPR does apply to you and take steps to comply. Likewise if you collect personal data as part of a marketing survey and the respondent could be in the EU.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Complying includes ensuring you have opt-in consent from everyone you send email marketing to, that you have that consent on record, and can show what they agreed to receive. You also need to ensure that any personally identifiable data you hold is adequately protected from data breaches, whether accidental or criminal. If there is a breach, you may need to comply with the GDPR rule that an EU regulator or &quot;supervising authority&quot; needs to be informed of a breach within 72 hours of finding the breach. The GDPR lays out the parameters that define whether or not a breach needs to be reported including whether the breach of personally identifiable data will place the rights and freedoms of EU citizens at risk. If that risk is high, the data subjects themselves need to be notified as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relying on consent as the legal basis for processing information is just one of the reasons allowed under the GDPR. If you are already providing a service to an individual, and the legal reason for processing their information could be &quot;legitimate interest&quot; or &quot;contractual obligation,&quot; then consent is not required for the purposes of that processing. However, if you want to use that personal information for a different reason, you would have to get consent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GDPR compliance is a complicated and multifaceted matter that merits expert attention from both legal and technology experts to ascertain just how much at risk you are and how securely your data is protected.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are countless data security regulations specific to their given industries, but in the world of finance - particularly US-based international finance - Sarbanes-Oxley rules. Though SOX has been in place since 2002, increased reliance on cloud computing, as well as the upcoming introduction of the EU's General Data Protection Regulation, has made it more relevant than ever.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SOX is a perfect bridge protocol for companiesundergoing a GDPR compliance auditin preparation for the May 2018 deadline - and that's anyone who does business with the EU. While SOX was once a primarily finance-oriented regulation, with more data in play today than ever before, the need for internal controls and regulatory compliance is also greater.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SOX compliance audits covera number of different areas, including proper financial disclosures, internal controls, and management certifications, but the IT aspects are the most relevant component for the post-GDPR world. Auditors review infrastructure, IT systems, policies, as well as ensuring proper certification of policy administrators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Part of what makes SOX so relevant 15 years after its institution is that it's a relatively non-specific piece of legislation - in other words, it doesn't say exactly how data has to be stored or what security practices a given business needs to use. This open-ended format means that despite significant changes in standards since its passage, it hasn't been structurally nullified. If anything, it's gained applications with the growing data industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GDPR: The European Angle</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So what does a 15-year-old American law have to do with new EU compliance regulations? The GDPR is meant to standardize data privacy laws across the EU, but due to security concerns, any country or individual business that intends to do business with a member of the EU needs to maintain comparable standards. There are several equivalent frameworks accepted under the EU-US Privacy Shield.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the acceptable frameworks are the existing Swiss-US shield, self-certification through the Department of Commerce, or by meeting the terms of other relevant industry regulations, such as HIPAA or PCI DSS. Essentially, if your business or charity already conforms to industry protocols, those terms will generally be acceptable to EU businesses. It is, however, valuable to undergo a complete audit to prove your readiness to partner companies. Still, for most companies, it's likely you're already doing what you need to do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why SOX?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With so many ways for a business to certify itself secure vis-&agrave;-vis the GDPR, why choose SOX? Compared to many of the other options, SOX is a proven framework that works to the advantage of businesses, rather than in an oppositional fashion. In fact, studies show that voluntary compliance withSOX actually saves businesses money, even for small businesses that often find compliance burdensome, particularly regarding data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because SOX allows for significant flexibility in terms of protocols and infrastructure, small businesses can choose systems relative to their scale and employ appropriate levels of support. For example, in the EU, most companies need a data protection officer (DPO) on staff, but US businesses are not mandated to employ DPOs. And while many other regulatory frameworks outline the specific security practices a business must use, the flexibility accorded by SOX means companies are likely using a higher standard of security than their competitors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GDPR won't go into effect until late May 2018, so we're yet to see how it will play out in US-EU business interactions, but presently businesses need to act more aggressively to complete certification.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you haven't started down the road to compliance with the EU's General Data Protection Regulation, let's face it, you're probably not going to hit the May 25, 2018 deadline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If this describes your situation, don't worry, you're not alone. According to Forrester, 80 percent of companies affected by the GDPR will not be compliant when the regulations take effect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even if you're going to be late to the party, doing certain things to become compliant can help your business beyond avoiding fines. Let's look at what exactly the GDPR is, and what you can do on the data management and processing side to be prepared.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even though the GDPR is a European regulation, it will affect companies across the globe. Any organization that deals with the personal data of any European &quot;natural persons,&quot; has to be compliant with the GDPR -- at least when it comes to those European citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It divides organizations into two main groups, data processors and data controllers. To quote theGDPR website, data processors &quot;process personal data on behalf of the controller.&quot; These are the data management service providers and other companies the help you store and work with your customer data. Data controllers determine &quot;the purposes, conditions and means of the processing of personal data.&quot; In other words, basically every company doing business in any industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These definitions speak to how the regulation views data ownership: companies doing business with personal data are considered the controllers of that data. The companies that provide storage and other services simply process that data. Now, there are some important things that data processors have to ensure, but there are two big things data controllers can do to make sure their compliance efforts are successful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.Know your data</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This sounds basic, but it's amazing how many companies take a &quot;set it and forget it&quot; attitude when it comes to their data. They upload it to the cloud, and then just assume it's secure and optimized.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's important to remember that data management doesn't stop when you upload to the cloud. You have to keep track of the types of data you have, and where it's stored. This has obvious security implications; private, sensitive data needs security measures that other data may not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also has business value. Archival data doesn't need to be stored at the edge, or on other systems that let you access it quickly. Likewise, some application data may need to be accessed instantly and securely. Taking stock of your data and where it's stored can lead to some real efficiency gains and cost savings. It'll help you comply with the GDPR, but it's an exercise you should complete frequently as a part of doing business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Control your data</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now that you know your data, look a little bit deeper and make sure you control it. The first part of this equation is pretty simple, maintaining the encryption keys in your environment. This, of course, gives you access control and avoids third-party exposure (which is a big no-no for the GDPR).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Next up, scrutinize the data service providers you work with to make sure they provide three critical features:</SPAN></P>

<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The right to erase data at any time. Intimately related to importing and exporting is deleting data. There should be no restrictions on your ability to completely remove data from your service providers' servers whenever you want or need to.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guaranteed data protection. Data protection services that should be included as part of your agreement with any provider include things like encryption of all data at rest and in transit, and the assurance that the provider has no access to that data (which is ensured by the encryption keys). These protections should be automatic, and there should be no way to disable them.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Intensifying regulatory pressures are top of mind for business leaders, with 78 percent of the 745 executives the firm surveyed worldwide expressing increasing concern about data protection and data privacy compliance. But with the May 25, 2018 deadline for GDPR compliance approaching, only 33 percent of respondents said they have a plan in place to comply with the European Union (EU) legislation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the average response of those in Europe was more positive, with 60 percent indicating they have a compliance plan in place, there's much more work to be done in other markets, where significantly fewer companies indicated readiness for GDPR compliance. For example, in the Americas only 13 percent have a compliance plan.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The General Data Protection Regulation is only a few short months away and organizational readiness to comply is in short supply.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This impending legislation is designed to provide rigorous data security and privacy protections and also give consumers more control over how their personal information is collected and used. Despite the looming deadline,Gartner warns that up to 50 percentof companies under the mandate will not be in full compliance by the end of 2018.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, many companies have no plan for GDPR because they do not believe that it will apply to them.NTT Securityfound that four in ten companies globally feel this way, with 75 percent of US businesses and 61 percent of UK businesses indicating their companies would not be affected. This is a mistake.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the regulation is targeted at protecting citizens of the European Union (EU), it actually does have global reach - any company that stores personal data on people residing in the EU will be affected. And we're not just talking about EU citizens here either. The key term is residents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Friends of mine, American citizens who live in Germany, are a great example of how GDPR can reach beyond EU-based businesses. EU residents for many years - they still own vacation property in Florida. Property which they rent using a relatively small US-based real estate management company. And because they are EU residents - that company, which only operates locally, is technically on the hook to comply with GDPR. And the problem is bigger than you might think.GlobeNewswireposits that 52 percent of US companies possess data on EU citizens making them legally subject to the regulations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Monetary Consequences of Noncompliance</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The regulators can start administering these protections on May 25, 2018 and the legally enforceable penalties for non-compliance, while gradually increasing in severity, can be pretty stiff. These start with a written warning for the first non-intentional violation. Violators are then subjected to regular periodic data protection audits which will shine a continuing regulatory spotlight on compliance trouble spots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This unwanted attention will cause, at minimum, discomfort for the 50 percent who try but fail to become totally compliant and potential catastrophe for those who did nothing to prepare and thus have unfavorable positions when negotiating with regulators. How much catastrophe is possible for repeat offenders?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Monetary penalties can range from \xE2,\xAC10 million or 2% of annual global turnover (revenue) - whichever is higher - to an upper limit of \xE2,\xAC20 million or 4%. In no way a drop in the bucket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reputational Consequences - Much Worse?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As devastating as the monetary penalties could be, the cost in terms of broken reputation and loss of customers may be worse. And these costs could easily spill over to companies who truly do have no legal obligation to comply. Why? Because GDPR is going to raise the bar on customer expectations - much like the early digital companies did several decades ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Think back to Amazon, Yahoo, eBay and a fewNew York City banks(the first to provide internet banking) as examples. Once they introduced online capabilities such as internet search, shopping, and finance - it didn't take long before every competitor had to follow suit or risk losing their customer base.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With GDPR, as consumers start to see what compliance actually means - and by extension what non-compliance looks like - we believe that they will start expecting ALL companies they do business with to comply regardless of whether those companies are legally obligated to do so or not. And, as in times past, these customers will &quot;vote with their feet&quot; and gravitate away from GDPR laggards towards those who provide the best data protections and consumer controls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even if the spread of expectations past the legal reach of GDPR takes some time, there is plenty of evidence that consumers are ready to exercise their rights under the mandate wherever and whenever they can. A recentSAS poll of UK adultshighlighted just how ready people are to take control of their personal data. Not only do almost half of the respondents plan to exercise these rights, but they are clearly educated on exactly what these rights will be.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The European Union's General Data Protection Regulation that goes into effect on May 25 has many organizations assessing whether they need to hire a chief data officer or chief analytics officer. After all, the GDPR mandates that any organization holding data on European citizens have a designated person with responsibility for compliance, accountability and communication of its data management practices.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the GDPR is only one reason why an organization should appoint a CDO. Information Management spoke with Richard McElroy, leader ofCalabrio'sCenter of Excellence for Analytics on when an organization should appoint a CDO, with what goals, and what qualities they should look for in that individual.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Information Management: In what ways can a chief data officer help an organization?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Richard McElroy: Big data within an enterprise is obviously a hot topic today. Many enterprises see investing in business intelligence and analytics technology and solutions as the only means to better leverage this data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although these technologies and related systems are a critical element, to truly benefit from an organization's data, the business needs to have executive sponsors and champions who understand data as an organizational asset that must be managed and leveraged appropriately. It needs to be a top down mandate that is executed upon by all of the stakeholders in an organization. And this, in my view, is the most significant way a CDO can help one's organization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IM: How is the CDO role evolving?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McElroy: From my perspective and experience, CDOs currently tend to focus mostly on risk, compliance and policy management roles. I see the CDO role (ideally) evolving to be more impactful on every functional area of a business-serving to drive information, and analytics and business intelligence strategies to better the business as a whole.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CDO role is evolving to serve more as a unifying factor between general data policies and strategies, and the key performance indicators and measures that evaluate the health and success of the organization. And, we are seeing the role further evolving from a pure regulatory focus to mainstream, thus helping engrain a more data-driven culture within the company.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IM: What best qualifies someone to become a CDO?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McElroy: Beyond the typical technical qualifications around data science, analytics and business intelligence, I believe a successful CDO must have two other critical additional-and critical-qualities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">See Also15 top job requirements for chief data officers</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First, they need to truly understand the business at its fundamental levels - the intricacies of the industry, the success factors across all functional areas within it, and the overall market dynamics. Without this, creating and /or managing a data strategy to truly benefit the business becomes an exercise in generalities, and ultimately, they likely will not make a significant positive impact on the business.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In just a few weeks, sweeping changes intended to better protect the private information of European citizens go into effect. With the networked, global nature of our economy, the General Data Protection Act is likely to touch even the smallest businesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As that May 25, 2018 deadline for compliance inches closer, there isn't a compliance officer on the planet who isn't consumed with making sure every asset that stores, processes or leverages personal data is covered. Fines for noncompliance are steep.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Organizations can be fined up to 4 percent of their annual revenue, or 20 million euros (approximately $24 million), whichever is greater, (source). And should a breach occur, the expectations for transparency are high and broadly reaching - the regulations require notification to each of the country's representatives within 72 hours of a breach (source).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With a usage intelligence solution, you may wonder how to ensure compliance if an external intermediary processes or stores the personal data covered under GDPR. Companies that run technology that are subject to the regulation should keep the following in mind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While not legal counsel, these guidelines should be considered by companies that have clients of usage and intelligence software.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ensuring Compliance, Who is Responsible?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under GDPR, the &quot;data controller,&quot; is responsible for ensuring that the principles and requirements in the regulations are met - such as collecting and managing consent. But when a third party - like a software usage and compliance analytics vendor -- processes or stores the data, it can be confusing as to who is actually the data controller. Let's clarify the roles as they are defined in the new regulations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the regulations, the controller is the one who &quot;determines the purposes and means of processing of personal data&quot; (source). The data processer is the one who processes the data on behalf of the controller. In short, the &quot;data controller&quot; is your company, and the &quot;data processor&quot; is the third party software vendor you're working with. The &quot;data subject&quot; is the end user - the individual you're collecting information about.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This means, if you've implemented usage or compliance intelligence software, that vendor is the data processor. Even though the vendor stores, works with, and augments information on your behalf, you are the data controller. The vendor may only process a data subject's personal information based on your direction. In short, as data controller, you are accountable under GDPR to assure that the principles are met.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What does that mean? Simply stated, it is the obligation of the data controller to confirm that the requirements of GDPR have been met by your usage and compliance intelligence vendor and they should have at the ready a summary of its real-time GDPR status in the event of an inquiry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is Consent Needed?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are several approaches that can be used to lawfully process personal information under GDPR. One of them is obtaining consent from the data subject.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Currently, many organizations obtain consent by an end user accepting an End User License Agreement (EULA). But under GDPR, the bar is much higher. Consent must be obtained by a clear affirmative act, be freely given, be specific and informed, and be unambiguous. And consent may be revoked at any time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's the good news: consent isn't necessary when leveraging compliance intelligence software. The regulations (Recital 47) protect the legitimate interest of the data controller when collecting and processing as it relates to compliance intelligence. The processing of personal data &quot;strictly necessary for the purposes of preventing fraud&quot; constitutes a legitimate interest of the data controller concerned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While it's not explicitly called out, the improvement of products and services may also be considered a legitimate interest. Article 29 specifies processing for research purposes (including marketing research) as processing for legitimate interest of a data controller when balanced with the rights and freedoms of a data subject.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And while consent isn't necessarily necessary, companies are encouraged to secure this especially with certain customer bases or geographical locations. A separate screen should be provided to have the consent tool highly visible in the EULA. Furthermore, an opt-in or opt-out function should be provided so users can update their settings at any time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fairness and transparency standard will also need to be addressed. This requires you to include a privacy notice with legal basis included, imply if a third party will have access and in what geographical location the processing will take place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reduce risk, optimize opportunity</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How is personal data defined? In the Court of Justice of the European Union opinion for Breyer v Bundesrepublik Deutschland, Case C-582/14, 12 May 2016, IP address combined with ISP records would constitute personal data in the hands of the website provider. But more broadly there could be applicability: even if you're not an ISP if you &quot;could keep the IP address indefinitely and could request at any time from the Internet access service provider additional data to combine with the IP address in order identify the user.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is recommended to only collect the minimum amount of personal information necessary to meet your goals when garnering and providing the information to a third party like a software usage intelligence provider. Most providers enable customers to collect organization IP addresses and other application and machine environment data so take advantage of this option as it might help in pinpointing organizations that infringe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In turn, look for ways to maximize opportunity. For example, as vendors consider the impact of GDPR on traditional email marketing campaigns, in-application messaging may be a more effective way of engaging with trial users and customers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ramping up efforts for targeted, in-app messaging campaigns allows you to get personalized messages to customers in a manner that is GDPR compliant. Since an existing business relationship exists with the end user, consent is not needed to send messages through in-app messaging software if the messages relate to the product being used. Of course, it is still important to provide an opt-out mechanism to stop receiving these messages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While GDPR might seem daunting if companies define the roles and requirements and follow some of these suggested guidelines, it can be achieved with minimal interruption to your business.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">960  words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In my role as the executive director of the Compliance, Governance and Oversight Counsel, I meet a wide range of data professionals: data privacy and regulatory compliance experts, database security experts, data analytics experts, data quality experts and so on. Most of them are exceptionally good at their jobs, but when I ask them about their strategies for coordinating their individual activities with the other data professionals in their organizations, the majority answer, &quot;What strategies?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's when I say, &quot;We should talk about unified governance.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Modern big data and digital transformation initiatives depend on three underlying conditions. Data must be accurate and current. Data must be secure. And data must comply with evolving and increasingly complex regulations. This is especially true in the area of data privacy, given the impending implementation of the EU'sGeneral Data Protection Regulation(GDPR).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Historically, achieving the first two conditions has been a data management function handled by IT and security, while the third has been an information governance (IG) function falling mainly to the legal, records and compliance teams.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These roles can no longer function in isolation. Those responsible for data management must recognize they can't ensure accurate, secure data or enable business insight without proper IG to safeguard data integrity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, those responsible for IG must accept that their mission has dramatically expanded from simply ensuring and proving regulatory compliance for auditing purposes to helping businesses achieve a single version of the truth, expose and extract value from information assets, and reduce a much wider array of risks associated with data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A UG program enables organizations to operationalize this needed interdependence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Scope of UG</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consider some of the activities and processes driving today's use of data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, to achieve faster and more efficient patient care, a healthcare company needs business users to have ready access to patient information and other data assets in a collaborative self-service mode. Users, however, can't wait for IT to provision the data and instead look for workarounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, throughout the enterprise, new APIs have been implemented allowing use of the underlying repositories and analytics through new and diverse tools. All these activities increase the risk of a data compromise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, sensitive and private information increasingly resides beyond the corporate firewall in multiple public cloud environments. The handling of this information, as well as the information shared with legal and supply chain partners, must comply with new and complex data privacy regulations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, true business insight can come only from a combination of structured and unstructured information assets managed within a unified framework that spans policy management, monitoring and enforcement, metadata management, data stewardship and information discovery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only a UG program can create this unified framework, reduce the risk associated with how data is accessed, and maintain compliance in a systematic way. The main functional elements of a UG program include:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How can you bring UG to your organization? Start with a strong business case to engender support from top management. This is the only way to secure broad operational support for the necessary activities, as well as the ongoing investment to sustain the program.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TheInformation Governance Reference Model(IGRM) is an excellent resource for helping you build the business case. It delineates the links between the value of information, the duties that must be performed to manage data, and the specific data stores that IT manages.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vol. 1</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">No. 1</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1195  words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Desperate to defend themselves against the growing ranks of hackers and data thieves around the world, businesses will spend more than $90 billion on cybersecurity this year. Unfortunately, much of that money will be wasted on outdated strategies in pursuit of an unreachable goal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Network protection-the mainstay of IT security for decades-is no longer a strategy for success. Firewall vendors and IT administrators simply cannot keep up with the constantly-evolving tactics developed by criminals, industrial spies, and hostile nations. Experience has shown that if an organization's data is valuable enough, someone will always find a way to steal it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An approach focused on the actual goal of IT security-protecting sensitive information-may eventually turn the tide against cyber threats. Organizations in every industry have begun to see that accepting defeat in the fight for network protection is the first step in winning the long-term battle for information security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Network security is a losing proposition because the numbers are all on the hackers' side. Once a hacker develops an effective attack, he or she can unleash it against hundreds, even thousands, of organizations with almost no additional effort or expense.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hijacked computers and other stolen assets are doing all the work, so turning up the volume can only increase the chances of success. The companies on the receiving end of these attacks, on the other hand, must spend more and more money each year in a hopeless effort to keep pace with the hundreds of adversaries trying to steal their data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even if an organization could implement a perfect firewall, one so sophisticated that no hacker could penetrate it, the company would have solved fewer than half of its cybersecurity problems. Sensitive data would continue to flow out of the network and into the hands of competitors, hackers, and spies, thanks to employees who-intentionally or not-compromise the company's security. Insider threats, by some accounts, are now to blame for more than 60 percent of all data breaches, and no amount of perimeter security or device protection can stop the bleeding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Faced with these uncomfortable truths, businesses and government entities are beginning to adopt a new philosophy when it comes to information security. Data theft, in this new worldview, is an inevitable event, rather than a risk to be avoided at all costs. It is key to prepare for a breach in advance, so the sky does not come crashing down once the bad guys find their way inside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neutralizing the Threat</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We'll never know how many security breaches follow this pattern, though the number certainly gets bigger every day. A hacker-using a new technology, an application vulnerability, or a set of credentials gained through social engineering-breaks into a company's internal network. After a week or two of scanning directories and file paths, the hacker spends another few days downloading gigabytes of highly sensitive information. Once the theft is complete, the hacker examines the stolen data and then&quot;does absolutely nothing, because the data is encrypted and therefore useless to anyone without the decryption key.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's the promise of data-centric security: that consumer data, intellectual property, and other sensitive information can be managed and protected so that it remains secure even when it is lost, stolen, or shared inappropriately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When companies shift their focus from perimeter defenses and put their efforts into protecting data itself, they position themselves for long-term security. When implemented properly, data protection is almost impossible to defeat, no matter how much computing power the attacker throws its way. Data-centric protection eases the burden of compliance with new cybersecurity regulations like the GDPR and the UK's recently-updated Data Protection Bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Auditing and Planning</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When a company wants to get serious about protecting its data, it needs to begin by assessing all the data types that are in use today, and determining which types will require protection tomorrow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is one of the biggest obstacles to data-centric security, because many organizations lack a clear understanding of their data. Database managers might know exactly what types of information are under their control, but the picture tends to get blurry once data moves out of the structured environment of an enterprise database. That's a problem, because most of the data in any organization is stored in the files-documents, images, email messages, and so on-that employees create and use on their laptops or other devices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A data-centric security strategy needs to address all forms of sensitive data, wherever they live, to be successful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Discovery and Classification</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having determined which types of data require protection, an organization can begin to implement the technologies that will do the work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The process typically starts with a combination of classification, in which files are tagged to indicate what types of data they contain, and discovery, which involves scanning files to determine whether they contain sensitive information. Discovery is an automated process, whilst classification can be performed manually by employees or automatically by a software agent. However the tasks are handled, the purpose is to create and maintain a real-time inventory of all sensitive data throughout the organization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Encryption</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Identifying sensitive data is only part of the challenge. The next and most crucial step is to apply a form of protection that keeps the data out of the wrong hands, while still allowing for proper use by employees and business partners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Strong encryption is the most effective form of data protection, and one that is essentially impossible to defeat when implemented properly. This explains why encryption is so politically controversial-even the world's most powerful supercomputer would require billions of years to complete a brute-force attack on a standard 256-bit encryption key. Law enforcement agencies may have their own opinions about it, but the fact is that when hackers encounter strong encryption, they give up the fight and move on in search of easier targets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Training</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No matter how well-designed a cybersecurity program may be, it can't do its job unless employees understand the importance of data protection and know exactly what they're expected to do with the sensitive information they handle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Usability is a critical concern. When a company's cybersecurity tools are slow, cumbersome, or confusing, employees will find ways to circumvent them. This means either letting sensitive data go unprotected, or using a non-sanctioned tool the employee happens to feel more comfortable with, which can cause just as many problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leave No Data Behind</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just as hackers will find and exploit the vulnerabilities of a network firewall, they will take advantage of any weak point in a company's data protection. To work, data-centric security needs to extend across the entire enterprise, and throughout the entire data lifecycle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Solutions that only protect certain forms of data, work on a few operating systems, or protect data in certain situations, create gaps in security.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Feb. 23--A California legislator has introduced legislation that will force social media sites to protect users from bots and create a state privacy agency to regulate and protect consumers' online information. The activity in Sacramento comes at a time of heightened urgency around these issues, including special counsel Robert Mueller's recent indictment of 13 Russians and three Russian companies for their use of bots on social media to diminish voter turnout in the 2016 presidential election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We saw the harm that this unregulated space could cause to citizens, and we decided to do something,&quot; said Rep. Marc Levine, D-District 10. &quot;There is just too much profit to be made off of real humans and bots,&quot; he said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A social media bot or chatterbot is a computer program that engages with users' conversation via text. The programs are designed to simulate how a human would behave in a discussion and are frequently mistaken for real people. Some 15 percent of the total users on Twitter that were active during the 2016 U.S. presidential election were bots. At least 400,000 thousand bots were responsible for about 3.8 million tweets, roughly 19 percent of the total volume during election season, according to Recode.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To stop the bots, Levine introduced AB 1950 in January, a bill that would require social media sites to identify and verify all social media advertising purchases to be linked to verifiable humans. &quot;AB 1950 will regulate bots and prevent the spread of misinformation,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Levine, the tech industry is unable to regulate itself. &quot;These things are not difficult to verify; the software they have written is not magic,&quot; he said. &quot;This is merely a work effort to add more lines of code. I am sure they can verify this stuff.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to Levine's bill on bots, the legislator has also introduced a placeholder bill (SB 2182) designed to protect users from social media companies taking ownership of a user's social media material; and other vital data that is held by companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bill would create the California Data Protection Authority and oversee Californians' personal data on the Internet. The legislation was inspired by the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which goes into effect in late March.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GDPR forces companies to erase a user's identity upon request. It also requires that social media companies explicitly state what users agree to when they sign a consent to participate in the social media platform. The rule also addresses data breaches. In the case of a breach, the GDPR calls for users to be notified within 72 hours when personal and sensitive information has been released, and it also allows for an independent authority to monitor complaints and violation of the rule. The independent regulator could charge and fine those companies that have violated the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Levine says there is a significant number of questions that need to be answered by regulation. The federal government has failed to act on the issues of privacy and the issue of ownership needs to be clarified, he said. &quot;The federal government has been useless and powerless. California has a role to play and can be a model for federal law.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Levine, key questions must be answered: &quot;Who owns your data? Once you decide to leave Facebook, do you still want your information to continue (in perpetuity)?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He points to the Equifax data breach that exposed more than 140 million Americans to identity theft and the hacking of Yahoo.com, which affected 3 billion email accounts containing passwords and birthdates. These companies were unable to inform their clients of the piracy in a timely fashion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook also gave academic researchers access to the home pages of some 689,000 users to conduct a study. Researchers manipulated users posts to make them feel more positive or negative through a process of &quot;emotional contagion.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bill would create an agency or privacy czar that would oversee the actions of Internet companies and hold them responsible for data breaches and other actions. &quot;I think it is important to have a regulatory agency that holds these companies and their actions accountable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he purposely wrote the bill in an open-ended way so that fellow lawmakers and regulation experts could have input on the final product. &quot;This bill will go through many committee hearings; it will change.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With both bills, Levine hopes to engage the industry early in the process of crafting the laws. &quot;This is a consumer protection measure, and we want to engage these companies and get their input.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The very open-endedness of the current bills has made it difficult for lobbying groups to develop positions. Two groups that one would expect to oppose these bills include the Computing Technology Industry Association (CompTIA), an advocate for the $1.5 trillion U.S. information technology ecosystem, and the California Chamber of Commerce. Both say they have not taken a position on either bill yet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far, he has seen lobbyists from trade groups within the sector but has not had contact directly with Facebook or Yahoo.com. &quot;I want to engage with social media companies to make sure this law works,&quot; he said. &quot;I would welcome heartier engagement.&quot;</SPAN></P>

The Association said foreigners bought 284,455 properties, about a third more than a year earlier. And, similar to previous years, a larger percentage of buyers, especially in states like Florida and Arizona, were European citizens.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As of May 25, 2018, U.S.-based businesses that have operations in the European Union (EU) or that have customers who are citizens of EU nations will have new requirements to meet regarding data protection. This is when the new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) takes effect. Any companies not prepared to meet the new regulations that experience a data breach could face massive fines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GDPR was designed to better protect EU citizen data and ensure companies storing that data should possess it. Standards vary based on where the data originates from, but generally any information like name, address, credit card number, etc. is covered. In the domestic U.S., protected data is defined as Personally Identifying Information (PII). And, as defined by GDPR, for an EU citizen it is known as Personal Data. Failure to protect the PII or Personal Data to the right standard could bring a hefty bill, or upon consistent failure, even an order to cease business in EU countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Related: Is cyber insurance prepared for GDPR?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">What this means for U.S. insurers</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Current U.S. based data privacy regulations require companies to notify customers if a data breach occurs. But in the U.S., there can be a significant time delay between the breach and the notification letter, not so with GDPR. GDPR requires the Supervisory Authorities be notified within 72 hours, even while a breach is still being investigated. Failure to report within 72 hours could lead to significant fines. Maximum fines could be up to $26MM or 4% of global gross revenue, whichever is greater.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Insurance companies selling plans to EU citizens purchasing homes, rental properties or commercial properties in the U.S. could be affected by GDPR because they gather Personal Data on applications and store data on customers. If a hacker is able to breach the insurance company's systems and gain access to EU citizen data, the company would be required to notify GDPR Supervisory Authorities and prove that it met all GDPR requirements. Failure to cooperate with an investigation or to meet GDPR requirements could lead to fines or worse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Related: Cyber risk management a top priority as companies prepare for GDPR</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Where to begin</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first step toward compliance for any company is determining the need for and if necessary, assigning a Data Protection Officer (DPO). A company will be required to have a DPO if it possesses large amounts of data covered by GDPR. The DPO must be available and involved in any events where there is a possibility of a loss of GDPR covered data. The DPO will be the point person for any GDPR issue with the affected persons and the Supervisory Authority. Obviously, because the DPO will be instrumental in proving a company's compliance with GDPR this individual needs to know the regulations and the company's security protocols inside and out, backward and forward. If a company is not required to have a DPO, it should still have a plan in place for who it will call if the Supervisory Authority opens an investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Related: 5 hallmarks of insurance industry digital leaders</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Additionally, any Personal Data that is lawfully received, stored or processed by a company needs to be encrypted. This means completely encrypted at rest and in transit, complete end to end encryption. GDPR does not allow for lenience regarding outdated software or new implementations that are being investigated for deployment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Companies will also now be required to complete Data Protection Assessments and Privacy Impact Assessments. They will be expected to increase visibility into what level of impact a breach might have for customers and the company, if one occurs. And, all efforts made to comply with GDPR need to be documented so they can be given to a Supervisory Authority upon request. The best source of information on the regulation requirements is gdpr-info.eu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">The road ahead</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once GDPR takes effect, if a company experiences a breach or is contacted by a GDPR Supervisory Authority, the best course of action is to show an attitude of compliance by offering complete support for the investigation. Then, contact the legal team. It is important to remember that complying with GDPR can be complex. It takes some time to update systems and processes to the level of security required by the new regulations. It can also be costly, and disruptive, but the protection of data is becoming paramount in the new business paradigm. For GDPR the cost of compliance is geared to be less than the cost of sanctions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Member preferences differ from user to user. However, there are some important steps that ensure credit unions create and deliver a frictionless and secure mobile banking experience for all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Vergara, director of security product marketing at Oakbrook Terrace, Ill.-based data security firm. VASCO offered eight tips financial institutions can use.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Credit unions need simple, quick but secure authentication.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Members generally want a secure, frictionless mobile experience that allows them to utilize more services using their mobile device. Financial institution attempted to offer faster, convenient logins by replacing complex passwords with simple PINs, fingerprint scanning or other biometrics. Vergara warned if not implemented correctly, they will not be secure. An underlying security framework solves the convenience versus security argument.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Provide a frictionless experience.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Friction dampens consumer enthusiasm for mobile banking and the login and authentication stage is where delay most often occurs. The mobile banking app and supporting IT uses multiple security technologies for securing devices and communication. Look for ways to tie these processes together without requiring extra actions by customers. &quot;For example, a mobile device can authenticate itself when a new session is started. Behavioral authentication technology is another frictionless option,&quot; Vergara emphasized.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Protect mobile banking apps.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The increased popularity of mobile banking created a very competitive and challenging environment, especially among mobile app developers. Rushed releases often create vulnerabilities in the application layer, Vergara noted. The BankBot Android mobile banking malware, for instance, besieged more than 420 leading banks in countries such as Germany, France, Austria, the Netherlands, Turkey and the United States. The malware allows attackers to create windows that sit on top of legitimate Android applications and intercept user information. &quot;It's important to harden the app via mobile app shielding and, specifically, Runtime Application Self-Protection or RASP.&quot; This keeps the app (and backend systems) safe even when the app is running on devices with disabled OS protection, or devices already infected with malware.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Measure risk on each mobile device.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The foundation of strong security is multi-layer controls. If a hacker manages to thwart one-layer, other controls mitigate malicious activity,&quot; Vergara held. Among these are technologies that analyze each device and associated behaviors of its user while engaged with a mobile banking app in real time. The goal is to score the risk of each device and provide actionable data for implementation of policy when critical thresholds are too high. For example, unpatched versions of OS or app software, an unknown public Wi-Fi network, a new password, or new biometric carry more risk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Adopt an omni-channel approach.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;To stay competitive, you need to seek ways to achieve a great user experience across channels - including mobile,&quot; Vergara said. Different channels often require different ways to prove user identity and to authorize operations. Variances can lead to friction and frustration. Look to inject a simple, intuitive experience with fewer required interactions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Combat social engineering and other threats</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Phishing and other types of social engineering such as its voice relative, vishing, exploit trust to steal valuable information such as usernames, passwords, credit card numbers or other sensitive data. Even with education and additional user controls, social engineering is still successful. &quot;The simple reason is that the final decision to complete a transaction is made by the user who authenticates to the financial institution,&quot; Vergara said. Financial institutions should only generate signature requests known by the credit union. The mobile device should automatically reject requests not coming from the credit union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Be ready for regulation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The banking industry is one of the most heavily regulated, and more rules are on the way. For example, in the EU, the new Payment Services Directive 2 is already in effect. It regulates the security of electronic payments - including mobile banking and retail payments security. Other regulations such as GDPR and PCI-DSS require multi-factor authentication to protect data or access control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Electronic document signing.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As digitization efforts mature and organizations realize its benefits in customer experience, compliance, productivity and hard cost savings. An electronic signature platform with flexibility accommodates any business process across any channel - online, the call center, the retail branch and mobile.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Too many businesses seem to be embracing Satchell Paige's famous admonition: &quot;Don't look back, something might be gaining on you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The General Data Protection Regulation, the European Union's new personal data privacy rules, takes effect May 28. And, with fewer than 10% of North American firms are fully prepared to comply with the regulation, according to new survey from data governance company Erwin, HR executives should be concerned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GDPR applies to any organization that processes personal data of citizens of the EU (including England), EU-based or not, and failure to comply could have hefty consequences: fines of up to 20 million Euros or 4% of annual revenue, whichever is greater.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At most North American companies, the CIO drives data governance efforts, according to the erwin survey. Yet, because HR groups handle a great deal of personal personnel data, and many U.S. companies have a global footprint, especially in the EU, HR's participation is critical to GDPR compliance. Not surprisingly, HR technology firms see a market opportunity in providing GDPR-compliant tools and services, which may work to HR managers' advantage-especially as the deadline looms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GDPR spells out data privacy practices that include detailed record-keeping, increased security measures (e.g. encryption), responsibilities regarding third-party services and mandatory data-breach notification. Some companies will need to appoint a data protection officer. (For a detailed explanation, gohere.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three general areas of the GDPR apply especially to HR and employee data: consent, access, and retention. All are familiar concepts in HR, but their enforcement has been significantly juiced. &quot;Aspects of the GDPR, like when and when not to rely on consent and the balance between holding onto data to ensure legislative compliance and deleting it, are going to be something of a balancing act for HR teams,&quot; according to Sue Lingard, marketing director for U.K.-based Cezanne HR Limited, which offers cloud-based, GDPR-compliant HR applications for mid-size businesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All this means that if an HR organization's toolbox consists mostly of spreadsheets and Word documents, it's time to upgrade. Just as the Y2K &quot;bug&quot; was a catalyst for companies to implement enterprise resource planning technology, the GDPR may goose HR organizations into making the most of the technology available to them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's why vendors of human capital management (HCM) systems are promoting their multi-application, multi-featured HR tool suites as GDPR compliance solutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Workday, for example,touts the strict adherenceto two important GDPR requirements, Privacy by Design and Privacy by Default, in the development of its application and data storage/transfer services. &quot;Workday's privacy team partners with product managers at the start of and throughout the development of every product &quot; which enables us to create more compliant products and avoids the need to redo work to ensure that personal data is properly processed,&quot; according to a blog on the company's website.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For SAP, incorporating GDPR compliance into its SuccessFactors HR suite of applications has been &quot;one of the company's largest development efforts,&quot; says Kim Lessley, director of solution management for cloud security in the SuccessFactors group. With the next general release of the suite in April, SAP will incorporate GDPR-compliance functions such as the purging of personal data (&quot;the right to be forgotten&quot;), logging changes to personal data, informing subjects of data stored about them, and obtaining consent for processing personal data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cloud-based HR services, vetted for GDPR compliance, can be a quick fix, offering relatively easy and cost-effective implementation, as well as advantageous functionality such as self-service. &quot;Regulators recommend that, where possible, providing self-service access to personal data helps address some of the issue around visibility and accuracy,&quot; according to Cezanne HR's Lingard. For instance, CIPHR, a UK-based HR apps provider, says its SaaS tools let employees &quot;access and update their own personal information via a secure self-service portal,&quot; and help HR organizations &quot;document when consent from employees was granted for processing personal data.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One HR function in particular-hiring-should be scrutinized carefully for potential compliance problems, says SAP SuccessFactor's Lessley. Hiring managers have been casting widely for data related to potential candidates, including on social media, which can get dicey in terms of consent. Also, candidate data gets passed around to various constituencies during the hiring process, making it difficult to keep track of who has had access to it and, when it needs to be purged, exactly where all copies reside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Applicant tracking systems (ATS) and candidate relationship management (CRM) software are designed to record and store such hiring data, and they're starting to tout their advantages in terms of the GDPR. For instance, recruiting software firm Lever describes its efforts regarding GDPR in a blog (&quot;How is Lever supporting our customers' GDPR compliance efforts?&quot;), which include &quot;adding various features to our product &quot; that will assist customers in meeting their notice and consent obligations, and retention obligations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GDPR's stringent data regulations and restrictions may be landing at a bad time for many HR organizations, just as they're realizing the advantages of extensive data mining and analytics in finding and making the most of their companies' best possible performers. On the positive side, GDPR will require HR executives to work more closely with their counterparts in IT on data architectures, accelerating a trend that will benefit both sides. &quot;IT and HR used to be more siloed,&quot; says SAP's Lessley. &quot;Now they have to work together.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, SAP's Lessley offers HR managers her own admonitions concerning GDPR compliance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vol. 1</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">No. 1</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">636  words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There seems to be some confusion between the data container and the data content, which appear to get lumped together and called a database.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In my experience IT takes ownership of the container and the user community - perhaps marketing, sales, manufacturing etc. - take ownership (or not, as the case may be) of the content. Neither collaborates as - to each other - they appear to speak completely different languages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So whose problem is it anyway? Data and information quality is actually a business problem, not an IT, marketing or any other silo'd department's problem. And it's abusiness problembecause poor quality data bites deeply into your bottom line.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So why should CEO's care? Firstly, the Introduction of the new GDPR compliance regulation in May, will mean that business data is very much on the agenda for organizations. With fines of up to 20 millions euros or 4 percent of global annual turnover for noncompliance, businesses need to make data a priority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is the obvious waste in data - duplications, mailing waste etc, but data integrity and data quality reaches far deeper than that. It's the bad decisions - when based upon false data - made with a high degree of certainty that do the real damage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many studies have shown that companies spend 20 to 40 percent of their turnover on data-related purchases and business processes, but few have accurate financial measures for this huge area of expenditure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We measure our capital expenditure (CAPEX) as a matter of course, but do you have a measure of your expenditure on data (DATEX)? If you did, the chances are you'd find it's around 10 times bigger than CAPEX.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No one questions the need to measure return on investment (ROI) or return on capital employed (ROCE), but what about return on capital invested in data (ROCID)? As we don't measure it, we shouldn't be surprised to see how poorly we manage it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Without a clearly thought out strategy and processes for data lifecycle management, (creation, maintenance and destruction) companies will continue to rack up huge, unrecorded and largely unrecognized costs arising from inefficiency, rework and duplication of effort, whilst remaining exposed to negative business impact of poor decisions and the damage to customer relationships.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As companies increase the volume of data they hold in the search for better results, the processes required for audit, control and management become more expensive and simultaneously less effective. Hidden costs associated with inefficiency, rework and duplication expand rapidly with data quality and leverage falling even further. Beyond a certain point, competitive positioning goes into reverse, while spending continues to rise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Breakout from this situation requires a re-examination of how the business manages data and a clearly thought out master data management strategy. This needs to be supported with appropriate business processes and tools, so that leverage is re-gained and competitive positioning advances with a smaller, easier to manage, overall volume of higher quality, reliable data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Resources released from inefficiencies, duplicated and irrelevant effort, reworking data-related problems, and repairing customer relationship damage, become available to drive the business forward and improve results across the board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Data is without doubt one of the cornerstones of industry. It is the foundation from which information, then knowledge, then wisdom is derived. The paradox is that many businesses have masses of data and little information, whilst their employees have masses of information and very little data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By following a few simple steps towards better data, companies can be assured that they are in the best position to target the right customers, maximize opportunities to gain new customers and grow existing customers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Take ownership.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vol. 1</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">No. 1</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With less than 100 days to 25 May, many organizations outside the European Union have the same question: &quot;Does the General Data Protection Regulation apply to my organization?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The answer has to be &quot;it depends&quot; - although this is an answer that no one likes. You cannot immediately say yes or no. Instead, you need to take a step-by-step approach to identify the requirements of GDPR, the organization's connection with the personal data of EU citizens and consult an attorney specializing in GDPR as needed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The answer to this question can only be given based on an analysis of the organization's operations and usage of personal data, based onArticle 3, which defines territorial scope. This article is really important for organizations outside of the EU to determine whether they need to adhere to GDPR. The article states that organizations must comply with GDPR if they offer goods or services to EU citizens, even without payment, or monitor behavior of EU citizens (data subjects). In today's digital world, these practices are not rare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The starting point should be to determine whether the organization processes personal data of EU citizens, either as a controller or a processor of data, or whether a part of your organization operates within EU borders. If the answer to one of these questions is yes, then it does not matter where your business headquarters are located. As long you are in the &quot;place where Member State law applies by virtue of public international law,&quot; you need to comply with GDPR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To help guide this process, organization should perform adata protection impact assessmentas a required element of GDPR. This is an initial step in determining the need to comply with GDPR in theprocess of GDPR implementation. Once the organization determines that it has to comply with the regulation, the compliance program must include all parts of data processing.Data processing&quot;includes the collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction of personal data.&quot; GDPR applies to both automated and manual data processing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The organization being impacted by GDPR needs to assess, implement and comply with specific GDPR requirements. These requirements will impact the entire organization and how day-to-day operations are being conducted with respect to personal data. New processes and controls should be implemented to protect personal data of EU citizens and also to protect the organization from liabilities caused by non-compliance with GDPR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Organizations that see 25 May not only as a deadline, but more as the starting point of a long-lasting GDPR compliance program, will have an advantage in processing personal data applying GDPR principles.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pg. 8</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vol. 34</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1251  words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gathering valuable customer data to build marketing profiles has become second nature for U.S. companies in the digital age.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a culture clash with European regulators - who have been ramping up privacy protections for their citizens - is coming in May. And for U.S. firms not properly handling the data they consider their sales lifeblood, it could get expensive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The penalties are the greater of 10 million euro (about $12.3 million) or 2 percent of global revenue for lesser offenses, and twice the euro or global revenue percentage for larger violations. Failure to notify a customer of a data security breach is one type of lesser offense, while regulators consider not getting consent to process someone's data, for example, as major.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It really is a pretty big deal,&quot; said Charles Russman, senior counsel in law firm Clark Hill's Birmingham office, referring to the European Union's new General Data Protection Regulation. &quot;The things that are most likely for U.S. companies not to be complying with are the things that are going to result in the large penalties.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Approved in April 2016, the GDPR aims to safeguard the personal information of European citizens. Replacing the 1995 Data Privacy Directive, the new regulation takes effect May 25.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GDPR has a much farther reach than the 1995 law - affecting companies across the world that handle the data of European citizens. It also defines &quot;personal information&quot; in a much broader way than U.S. regulations do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Claudia Rast, who heads up the cybersecurity and privacy team for Butzel Long, worries that some smaller businesses may not have given the regulation enough attention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Most companies with global reach have been aware of this for some time and have been implementing the protections they need,&quot; said Rast, based in the law firm's Ann Arbor office. &quot;There are those that think it doesn't apply - 'I'm here in the U.S. and I'm not going to worry about it.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consider a metro Detroit business that has no physical European presence. But it keeps a database of customer names, addresses and payment information from its e-commerce division, which ships products to Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That company is subject to the new regulation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even companies not engaged in e-commerce may be affected, if they're gathering &quot;personally identifiable&quot; information, such as IP addresses or location data of Europeans hitting their website, to monitor behavior.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the United States, companies typically have had to gather a combination of information - name and Social Security number, for example - to meet the personally identifiable test, said Michael Hindelang, co-chair of the data security and privacy litigation practice in Honigman, Miller, Schwartz and Cohn LLP's Detroit law office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The EU has a very different view of privacy than what we have in the U.S.,&quot; he said. &quot;If you track people around the globe, you're in. It's going to catch many more U.S. entities than the old legislation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Businesses that collect data won't be alone in having to protect it. Their contractors - ranging from &quot;cloud&quot; storage services to accountants to business consultants - will, too, Russman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Data controllers - companies that own databases - are responsible for instructing contractors on proper care of customer data, said Colin Battersby, principal attorney and co-lead of the cybersecurity and data team at Miller Canfield's Detroit office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's certainly (also) liability for (contractors) not doing what they were told to do,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Assess your compliance</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, how do companies make sure they're in compliance with the GDPR?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The first step is taking a look at what information you have, how you collect it and who it belongs to,&quot; Battersby said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If a company is handling European customer data, it will need to:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Obtain clear consent from customers to gather that data and explain what its use will be. Assuming there's consent until customers opt out won't be sufficient;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Use collected data for a &quot;lawful purpose&quot;- whatever use customers agreed to;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Allow customers the right to review and correct gathered data;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Only keep data as long as it's needed;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Give customers the ability to have information deleted; and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Within 72 hours of a data breach, notify anyone who is affected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That 72 hours is a game changer,&quot; Battersby said, adding that most companies won't have time to investigate how the breach occurred before they notify customers. &quot;(It) is quicker than any (policy) I've seen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Companies also will have to do Data Protection Impact Assessments to assure that new technology they add complies with privacy rules.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new protection requirements apply only to the data of EU citizens, although Britain - leaving the EU in 2019 - is expected to put an equivalent act into effect, Rast said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That raises a logistical issue for U.S. companies regarding non-European customers. Many may find it easier to make the EU standard a global one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Does it make sense to give the U.S. data the EU level of protection or do you want to maintain two separate systems?&quot; Hindelang asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GDPR also raises an enforcement question: How will a European entity exercise jurisdiction over companies on U.S. soil? Even attorneys who have been watching the regulation from its inception are unsure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is brand new, so no one knows,&quot; Rast said. &quot;In general, I can tell you, the EU, when it comes to privacy protection, means business.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Enforcement is clearer if a U.S. company has a European operation. The EU, which requires companies to have an onsite data protection officer, could pursue punishment through a European court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. authorities may enforce the EU regulation on behalf of its treaty partners, Russman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There will surely be a test case somewhere outside Europe - in the U.S. or Canada,&quot; He said. &quot;Someone will say, 'I don't think so (when it comes to following EU rules).'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's strong incentive for regulators to pursue fines, since they get to keep all that money for the enforcement budget, Russman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adds Battersby, &quot;There's a thought the European Union may try to make a splash with a few enforcement actions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Start now</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Insurers are aware of the potential liability and are looking at whether companies have a clear compliance plan when determining rates for cybersecurity insurance, Russman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attorneys say many clients now are asking whether GDPR applies to them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If they have business in Europe, we're helping with this on an almost daily basis,&quot; Russman said. &quot;Frankly, I would like to see more clients be asking questions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jason Brown, chief information security officer for Ann Arbor-based Merit Network, is getting the same type of inquiries from the 350 hospitals, K-12 schools and universities that make up that nonprofit network.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of institutions have been caught off guard by this,&quot; Brown said. &quot;They don't understand why someone in the U.S. has to abide by a foreign regulation. We are going to start doing some training in the next month or so.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hindelang said he hasn't seen projections as to how much the new EU regulation will cost U.S. businesses overall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The bigger you are and the more business you're doing in the EU, you're going to have to staff up or be prepared to deal with this,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most large, multinational organizations are well along in updating policies and putting technology in place to meet the new EU requirements, Rast said. Small companies just learning about GDPR likely still can meet the compliance deadline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there's little time to waste.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's something you can't afford to sleep on,&quot; Battersby said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While blockchain and the General Data Protection Regulation are currently two of the data management industry's hottest buzzwords, they have more than just buzz in common as the industry continues to ponder their respective impact. They share the same level of excitement as well as the same level of scepticism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Interestingly, they may be linked in another way - the fact that blockchain could play an important role in helping organizations comply with GDPR rules.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PWC definesblockchain as a digital, decentralized ledger that keeps a record of all transactions that take place across a peer-to-peer network so that participants can transfer assets across the Internet without the need for a centralized third party.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According toGartner's Emerging Technologies Hype Cycle, blockchain is at the &quot;peak of inflated expectations,&quot; meaning that it is a hot topic among audiences, and there are numerous ideas and theories about how it can be used. While there are many use cases, the reality is very few are up and running. And, although it's predicted to become an important technology, nobody really knows if it will go mainstream, what it will mean, which technology will become the de-facto standard, and when it all will happen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GDPR, on the other hand, is a good bit more tangible with a deadline for compliance of May 25, 2018. By this date, all organizations worldwide doing business with EU customers must assess their information strategy, technology, processes and staff against GDPR rules regarding personal data and implement changes to remain compliant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GDPR has an enormous impact to companies around the globe, as it requires any business that stores and manages personal data of EU citizens to handle this information in a transparent and structured manner. Regardless of whether this personal data involves a prospect, customer and/or employee, under the GDPR individuals will be given new data rights, which include the &quot;Right to be Forgotten&quot; and the &quot;Right to Data Portability.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Originally adopted by the European Parliament in April 2016, organizations have been given ample warning, yet it remains unclear if many organizations will be able to comply with the pending deadline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How Blockchain Can Impact GDPR: A Look at How It Could Help Financial Services</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Notwithstanding the relative uncertainty of both initiatives, many have begun to consider whether blockchain technology could be used to improve customer data management processes, as it relates to the upcoming GDPR rules. But how?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is the basis of amaster's thesiswe recently published. This thesis investigates how the banking industry can comply with GDPR by leveraging public blockchain technology for identity management. It also seeks to understand if blockchain technology can facilitate the managing and auditing processes of personally identifiable information (PII) in a way that will support companies complying with this new regulatory framework.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Privacy and data protection have become a critical concern, which is what prompted the GDPR to be introduced in the first place. The idea we proffered in the thesis is to make a consent management system on blockchain, as this can help manage the process of what each individual is willing to share. In the financial sector, for example, knowing each party's identity before a transaction can be executed has been around for a while.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Know Your Customer (KYC) is applicable for every bank worldwide and is all about identifying your customer and verifying their PII. The process is repetitive, which means mistakes can occur causing duplicate versions of PII. Designing a consent management system based on blockchain could provide a simple, accessible and immutable audit trail that eases the audit and compliance tasks for organizations while providing individuals with an easy and trusted way to get an overview of with whom they have shared their personal information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sounds like blockchain fits perfectly with the GDPR's main objective of protecting personal data, right? Not exactly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since public blockchains are immutable, once information is stored in blockchains it cannot be changed or deleted. And while otherwise appropriate for other use cases, this is where blockchain technology appears to clash with the requirements of the General Data Protection Regulation. With the GDPR, individuals will have the right to be forgotten - meaning that organizations will have to delete ALL personal data of an individual upon request.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But since it's nearly impossible to delete things off the public blockchain, GDPR and blockchain may not be compatible -- or are they? It all comes down to two issues:</SPAN></P>

<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is data put &quot;beyond use&quot; considered &quot;forgotten&quot; under GDPR?&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Managing Consent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In some cases, managing PII information may be handled by the individual themselves as there may be an opportunity for them to sell this information to companies at a premium. However, blockchain can be used to manage consents-another vital aspect of the new regulation that in some cases requires organizations to collect consent specific to its purpose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This means that each individual in a database has different consents linked to him or her, as opposed to today where organizations use &quot;omnibus&quot;-consent or &quot;one-consent-for-all.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Putting Data Beyond Use</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Authors of a recent study by Deloitte entitledBlockchain &amp; Cyber Security: Let's Discusscontend that implementing the right to be forgotten in a technology that guarantees nothing will be erased actually has multiple solutions. The authors write:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One solution is to encrypt the personal information written in the system, to ensure that, when the time comes, forgetting the keys will ensure that sensitive information is no longer accessible. Another possibility is to focus on the value of blockchain to provide unalterable evidence of facts by writing the hash of transactions to it, while the transactions themselves are stored outside of the system. This maintains the integrity of transactions, while enabling the ability to erase the transactions, leaving only vestigial traces of forgotten information in the blockchain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Furthermore, the United Kingdom's Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has providedguidancethat states putting data beyond use satisfies the standards for data privacy in the UK's Data Privacy Act so long as the data controller holding it:</SPAN></P>

</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blockchain Can Help, But There is Still Work to Do for Full GDPR Compliance</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, as you can see, while there are still some unanswered questions regarding the capabilities of blockchain technology to support the GDPR efforts, the technology seems to have significant potential.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, there are at least three areas that need to be addressed: available technology, the regulation itself, and the people that will be managing and/or affected by it. Each must work together in real-life, as adopting and using such a solution will require a different approach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As discussed earlier, it is important how the data is being managed by the organization and whether the blockchain is public or private.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the regulative efforts seek to provide individuals with increased control of their personal information, a critical topic to reassess from a regulatory perspective is the requirement for banks to obtain and store PII data locally. Without this requirement, PII could be accessed remotely by the bank instead, which will ensure a single source of truth where individuals have full control of their attributes and who has access to which information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Additionally, the option for trusted parties to provide their verification would allow individuals to continuously build the trust and validity of their digital identity over time, without relying only on one single organization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More technical research into the topic of data storage and blockchain will be needed to answer whether the right to be forgotten can be satisfied in such an autonomous system. One thing that is certain is that the use cases for such a solution would stretch across all industries and solve many challenges encountered by financial institutions, as well as many other organizations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bottom line? While there is some question whether public blockchain can legally be used for storing personal data at this point, there is the potential that it may someday fully align with the GDPR requirement and &quot;the right to be forgotten.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While European businesses brace themselves for the May 2018 deadline to comply with the General Data Protection Regulation, recent surveys have shown thatjust 25 percentof U.S. companies believe the regulation applies to them. That misconception could end up costing them up to four percent of global revenues or \xE2,\xAC20 million (approximately $24.5 million), whichever is greater.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The regulation is designed to give consumers more control over their personal identifying data, including IP addresses, location and genetic data. It clearly outlines the rights of consumers, or &quot;data subjects,&quot; including the right to access, right to be forgotten and right to data portability, all aimed at improving transparency and data security.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though GDPR is more of an evolution than a revolution in the way businesses capture, process and store third-party data, it will be transformational because it'll reach beyond the borders of the EU, affecting any and every business that handles data belonging to European citizens, regardless of geographical location.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Further, GDPR will change consumer expectations for how their data is handled across the board, adding pressure to companies who may not be regulated. With such steep penalties for non-compliance just a few months away, it's time for U.S. companies to understand how GDPR will impact their businesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So what should these U.S. companies expect when GDPR goes into effect? And what simple steps can an IT team take to make sure customer data - and their company - is protected?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No More Delayed Breach Disclosures</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the key components of GDPR is the way it governs data breaches, giving companies just 72 hours to notify users if their personal data has been compromised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In light of the massive data breaches we've seen at U.S. companies such as Equifax and Uber, and how long they delayed disclosing those breaches to the public - six weeks for Equifax and over a year for Uber - it's clear that some US companies aren't yet ready (or willing) to speed up their notification processes. These failures to disclose are a key reasonmore than two thirdsof U.S. and UK consumers are concerned about how brands use their personal data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GDPR technically only requires companies that have suffered a data breach to notify EU citizens. But unless these companies have internal IT systems and procedures that are structured in such a way that they can easily separate customer data by country, they will ultimately need to disclose the breach to all customers, or risk violating the law by missing even a single EU citizen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IT teams should begin preparing for these possibilities now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Start by clearly documenting what personal data you hold, where it came from and who you share it with. Then, sync with your customer communications team to review and update privacy notices, develop response procedures for customer requests for data access and deletion, and refresh methods of seeking, recording and managing consent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While it's a shame this sort of transparency had to be enforced by law rather than handled by good business practices, GDPR's strict disclosure rules may help US companies rebuild consumer trust in the event of breach. Early notification is key for consumers to be able to take measures to protect themselves from those who would profit from stolen data, and GDPR will cut down on the time bad actors have to do significant damage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">US Version on the Way?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">European governments have traditionally been at the forefront of data privacy legislation, but bilateral data-sharing agreements between the EU and the U.S. mean there will likely be a similar or complementary law on the books in the US.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From my perspective, it's less of an &quot;if&quot; and more about &quot;when&quot; the US will adopt a version of GDPR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though the U.S. regulatory climate is in flux right now, it's reasonable to expect this change within the next five years. U.S. businesses that currently operate or soon plan to operate within the EU must take action now to ensure compliance with GDPR. Even IT teams at companies that won't be regulated should start acting like companies that are - they'll be ahead of the curve when similar protections inevitably extend to US consumers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One key way to get ahead is to appoint a data protection officer responsible for ensuring compliance with the law. Though GDPR only requires companies that employ more than 250 people or that process more than 5,000 data subject profiles per year to appoint a DPO, every IT team should designate a point person to spearhead the compliance effort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tough Love</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because of the complex system upgrades and internal process changes required for GDPR compliance, it's safe to say that the shift will feel like a burden for IT, legal and HR teams at first. However, I see GDPR as a dose of tough love for organizations both inside and outside the EU. It serves as a forcing function for companies to modernize their data management systems, while improving how they communicate with, and relate to, their customers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The upfront time and capital investment required to comply may initially be painful, but will ultimately create value for both businesses and their consumers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Data management is about to get even harder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The General Data Protection Regulation, the EU's new comprehensive privacy regulation will enable individuals to have their data deleted, moved, or produced upon request. While this is a groundbreaking step for individual data privacy rights, the regulation's steep demands coupled with fines of up to 4 percent of global annual turnover put organizations in a compromised position in which their management of data assets can be dictated by third parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is also the potential for mass misuse of these new rights.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For instance, consider the mishap a dissatisfied celebrity with a large following could cause by compelling their social media followers to ask an organization to delete all their personal data. This organization could be faced with the task of having to identify and delete data for hundreds or even thousands of data subjects in a short period of time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are also lingering questions about whether companies could somehow weaponize GDPR against their competitors in a similar fashion through affecting an influx of subject access requests with the goal of disrupting business operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such uncertainties, among others, will have to be addressed by the regulators, but currently many problematic questions yet remain with regards to how GDPR will be enforced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Preparing for May</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a means of ensuring compliance with GDPR once it goes into effect this May, many organizations are now trying to set in place processes and technologies that will allow them to locate, produce, and delete data when requested. The issue with the approaches being taken, however, is that they're reactive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Due to the large volumes of requests companies are likely to receive, the stringent timeframes for responding, and the potentially massive fines, organizations will likely have to scramble to respond to data subjects' requests. Many organizations have little understanding of how data is being used because it's not properly governed, and therefore cannot defensibly justify its use.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The truth is, while many solutions will claim to help find personal data, that is just one step in a process that is much more complicated than most realize. These solutions likely won't enable organizations to bridge across all data types, formats, locations, modes of management, and functions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Are organizations going to search each data silo individually? Once they find the data, then what? Can they delete data with confidence knowing that it's not being used for other legal, regulatory or business purposes? There will be a dynamic hierarchy dictating which of the various data functions take precedence when they conflict, and reconciling them will be exceptionally difficult if each function is managed in isolation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Furthermore, if data is not classified, users will have to make real-time decisions on what data can be deleted, which may be near-impossible given the tight windows, the lack of insight into how data is being used across the enterprise, and no way of controlling it all in synergy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Without true understanding and governance over their data, companies will be put in a compromised position in which power over how they manage data assets is transferred to the data subject. When overloaded with a mountain of subject requests, and data yet to be classified based on its purpose to the company, what choice will employees tasked with servicing such requests have other than to simply comply with them?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The road not taken</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An ideal approach will be one in which organizations can proactively classify, govern and search all unstructured enterprise data from a single location. In such a system, data is assigned a lifecycle management policy based on how and why it is being used, enabling organizations to defensibly justify and demonstrate its use to a data subject or supervisory authority. These types of granular controls have traditionally only been applied to traditional records, and thus few platforms are capable of applying them across the entirety of enterprise data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When properly deployed, however, organizations embracing this holistic approach find a wealth of benefits: One singular search bridges all data silos, which means no scrambling to find which systems an individual has personal data in. Deduplication simplifies data remediation, and helps ensure data is never deleted when it needs to be kept or vice versa. And finally, records management, eDiscovery, compliance and analytics are all executed within the same platform and with a single data set, so that policies from each of these functions can be seamlessly managed in synergy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the number of functions for data grow, so do the number of data silos across today's enterprises.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IBM sees&nbsp;blockchain as much more than the foundation for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and wants the government to consider embracing it as a way of saving time, cost and risk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IBM is among a growing number of vendors offering blockchain as a service (BaaS), which allows enterprises to pilot the technology without massive capital expenditures related to onsite development and hardware.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blockchain is 'transformative' as projects proliferate</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IBM fellow Jerry Cuomo told the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology on Wednesday that blockchain is &quot;transformative&quot; and said his company has engaged in more than 400 blockchain projects across a number of industries, including supply chain, financial services, healthcare and government. And while the U.S. is leading the world in blockchain development, he called for more government efforts to promote and deploy the technology itself.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[ Further reading: Blockchain in the real world: 3 enterprise use cases ]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, the Congressional Blockchain Caucus, launched in 2016, is working to collect information on blockchain projects that could help individuals securely establish their identity, enable online payments - such as tax payments - and revamp supply chains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And 451 Research senior analyst Csilla Zsigri, in a recent interview with Computerworld, said governments would see benefits in using the technology to digitize documentation and make access to public services quicker and easier - while saving money and time in the process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zsigri noted that Estonia has been using blockchain for its e-Estonia program, which enables online tax payments, digital ID, i-voting, and electronic health records platforms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, most bureaucratic processes (except for marriage/divorce I think) can be done online, which reportedly saves Estonia ~2% of GDP a year,&quot; Zsigri said. &quot;All databases - education, healthcare, tax, police, etc. - are digitally linked on the data exchange platform: X-Road.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Dubai Government is working on a city-wide blockchain pilot with IBM and ConsenSys to streamline ID verification to reduce business registration times, and is digitizing and tracking citizens' health records, wills and contracts, among other assets, Zsigri said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cuomo also warned Congress about seeking to overregulate the industry because of the volatile cryptocurrency market, explaining that digital tokens - while based on blockchain - do not represent the potential of the technology. Regulators looking to reign in cryptocurrency, should ensure &quot;that there will not be unintended consequences that stymie the innovation and development surrounding blockchain,&quot; Cuomo said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Governments eye a crypto crackdown</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S., China and other countries have lately considered a more hands-on regulatory approach to cryptocurrencies to control what has become a kind of digital token Wild West.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a growing concern that cryptocurrency could be a threat to the global financial system through unbridled speculation and unsecured borrowing by consumers looking to purchase the virtual money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cuomo said IBM is currently working with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Office of Personnel Management to explore how blockchain can reduce complexity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;First and foremost, blockchain is changing the game. In today's digitally networked world, no single institution works in isolation. At the center of a blockchain is this notion of a shared immutable ledger. You see, members of a blockchain network each have an exact copy of the ledger,&quot; Cuomo said. &quot;Therefore, all participants in an interaction have an up-to-date ledger that reflects the most recent transactions - and these transactions, once entered, cannot be changed on the ledger.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For blockchain to fulfill its potential, it must be &quot;open,&quot; Cuomo emphasized, and based on non-proprietary technology that will encourage widespread industry adoption by ensuring compatibility and interoperability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IBM is among a group of 180 industry vendors participating in the Hyperledger Project, an open-source blockchain platform backed by the Linux Foundation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Successful blockchain projects</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cuomo illustrated the technology's value by describing a partnership with Maersk, the world's largest shipping company. Maersk deployed a blockchain-based trading platform based on IBM's BaaS for its ocean freight business. The blockchain pilot replaces a mainly paper-based shipment tracking system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael White, former president of Maersk Line in North America and CEO of the new venture with IBM, said blockchain significantly increases efficiency and security because, while the network is open to participants, its used of double encryption and immutability make it a record users can trust.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blockchains can be encrypted or unencrypted, depending on the level of security required, but records are auditable because the data in the database cannot be changed and is tied to each authorized participant in the chain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If anything changes in a document..., it's immediately apparent to all,&quot; White said in an interview with Computerworld.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blockchain's native immutability as a distributed ledger can also create an automatic audit trail for regulators, something with which many industries, including financial services, have struggled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In listing blockchain's attributes, Cuomo explained to the committee that:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Time is saved because multi-party transactions can settle immediately, avoiding exhaustive reconciliation that often takes days or even months.Costs are reduced because business-to-business processing eliminates overhead caused by &quot;middlemen.&quot;And risk is mitigated because the ledger acts as an immutable audit trail, greatly reducing the chances for tampering and collusion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IBM's research lab is also exploring blockchain as a method for verifying the authenticity of physical assets, such as a type of a diamond, petroleum or a manufactured part as a corresponding digital asset in a blockchain network to help ensure provenance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Smartphone-based artificial intelligence technology [can be] used to scan the high value item,&quot; he said. &quot;Using light spectral analysis to capture the microscopic properties, viscosity and other identifiers creates a digital fingerprint that can be used to verify authenticity and avoid counterfeiting documents or fake substitute products.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IBM is also working with SecureKey and the Sovrin Foundation to build a global ecosystem of blockchain identity networks backed by industry standards that ensure only the information that needs to be shared is. With blockchain, identity theft and fraud can be significantly reduced while the effectiveness of government-mandated Know-Your-Customer and Anti-Money Laundering rules is enhanced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blockchain's immutable record is natively auditable, allowing members to follow and adhere to existing government regulations like HIPAA and General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR), Cuomo explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Microsoft just announced plans to pilot a blockchain-based digital ID platform that would allow users to control access to sensitive online information via an encrypted data hub.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blockchain: Beyond the recent hype, more to do</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While blockchain's potential for industry change is still emerging, there remains a great deal of industry hype around it; as a result, many enterprises are rolling out projects without first identifying a real need for blockchain or accounting for costs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're no longer crawling on the floor, but when talking to companies deeply into blockchain projects - some started years ago - the more they work with it the more they see there's still stuff to be fixed,&quot; said Forrester Research principal analyst Martha Bennett.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a recent Webinar, Bennett described blockchain technology as a write-once, append-many store of records; a record could be just the hash or a transaction that lives elsewhere, or it could be all of the transaction data or an image file.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But immutable, blockchain isn't; it's simply prohibitively expensive to change anything in a blockchain environment because its architecture requires a majority of users to agree on changes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Additionally, by default, all data that is on chain is in the clear, even when it's a permissioned and non-public blockchain like bitcoin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other problems with blockchain also exist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, the open-source blockchain Ethereum Foundation is exploring ways to fix native performance issues associated with the technology.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a lot of talk around blockchain technology as if it were something real and finished where you can buy a CRM system,&quot; Bennett said. &quot;Not so in the case of blockchain. It has some growing up to do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the biggest challenges: what is the governance model that applies to a blockchain-based network? For example, what are the participant's rights, their obligations, how are conflicts resolved, and how is liability handled?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What are the decision flows if a remedial action needs to be taken because a bug is discovered or a smart contract interacted with another smart contract in unexpected ways?&quot; Bennett said. &quot;Those pieces still need to be assembled.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Smart contracts, one of the more attractive aspects of blockchain technology, are a form of business automation where rules can be created to automatically execute actions, such as transferring funds once certain conditions between two business parties are met.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Strictly speaking, smart contracts are not smart or contracts in the legal sense,&quot; Bennett explained. &quot;That's why some developers working with blockchain-based architectures are saying we're not even going there yet. For others, that's still some of the most promising areas they want to drive forward in 2018.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IBM's Cuomo also cautioned Congress that the need for security continues to be highlighted by blockchain &quot;breaches in the news every month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As much as everyone tries, it's impossible to eliminate all people with malicious intent or sloppy actions,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An enterprise blockchain network must implement algorithms like crash and byzantine fault tolerance, which allow a network to continue to operate even in the presence of &quot;bad actors or carelessness&quot; - something that is delivered today in Hyperledger Fabric, one of the frameworks from the Hyperledger project, Cuomo explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Blockchain is ready for government, now let's get government ready for blockchain,&quot; Cuomo said. &quot;Carefully evaluate policies established regarding cryptocurrencies to ensure that there will not be unintended consequences that stymie the innovation and development surrounding blockchain. A policy that has not been carefully vetted could risk inhibiting the U.S. leadership position.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anna Johansson</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vol. 1</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">No. 1</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">618  words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Data management rarely regards national borders. That's why, when the EU passed the General Data Protection Regulation in 2016, companies in the United States were forced to take notice. In order to effectively do business across this international boundary, U.S.-based companies will need to boost their privacy practices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though U.S. and EU companies may not use identical privacy practices, social organization control (SOC) audits are one bridge between the two. Add to that potentially recruiting a data protection officer (DPO) and participating in the Privacy Shield program with the Swiss government, and U.S. businesses can maintain eligibility for processing EU personal data.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SOC Functions</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SOC audits are an originally American privacy practice used to assess data security practices among various service providers and come in two different forms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the purposes of GDPR compliance, an SOC 2 audit is the most appropriate approach. In the US, SOC 2 audits are used toevaluate HIPAA and PCI compliancebut the practice is transferrable to other privacy frameworks as needed, hence its use for companies concerned with GDPR compliance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Depending on the role of your company in data processing, you may also consider adding an SOC 3 audit, a sub-type designed for public use. SOC 3 audits can provide a level of clarity and trust to clients, who are more concerned about data privacy than ever before in light of repeat security breaches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DPO Or SOC - Do You Need Both?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the GDPR, EU member states arerequired to appoint a DPOto manage both the technical and social components of data privacy. But do U.S.-based companies need a DPO in order to do business under this new framework?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Currently, it appears that under the current GDPR outline, only EU-member states, not U.S. participants, need to appoint DPOs, but that doesn't mean US companies should be complacent. Rather, the role of a DPO can be largely replicated by enhancing the duties of the chief data officer (CDO) and compliance officials. As U.S. companies don't need to navigate the GDPR to the letter, appointing a DPO is optional. The key is to match GDPR regulations with a comparable degree of security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EU-US Privacy Shield: Another Option</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GDPR doesn't go into effect until May 2018, but since January 2017, the United States has beenparty to the Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework. The Privacy Shield is essentially a precursor to the GDPR, certifying that a U.S. company is in compliance with Swiss privacy requirements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Privacy Shield Framework is an optional one, jointly administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce and the International Trade Administration, but companies that choose to participate in the current version of the framework are more likely to be in compliance with the remainder of GDPR requirements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework replaces the older Safe Harbor model, which has since been deemed insufficient protection for consumer data. However, the new Swiss-U.S. framework is an ideal one for businesses concerned about the GDPR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite similar requirements, those rules provided by the UK, for example, are no longer sufficient in a post-Brexit legal framework. In this regard, it's better for U.S. companies to get on board with the European framework for business purposes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">American companies have had a tough time maintaining sufficient privacy safeguards, as evidenced by the recent Equifax breach, among other high profile cases. SOC audits are a good place to start in terms of U.S. security standards, but ultimately, the GDPR could be very valuable to US companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even if nationally we lack a rigorous security standard, international protections could force corporate America's hand.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Bruemmer</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vol. 1</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">No. 1</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">838  words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To say 2017 was a tumultuous year for the cybersecurity industry would be an understatement. Indeed, last year cybersecurity further cemented itself as top concern spanning industries, cultures and continents. And we saw emerging trends take hold, like the thinning line between cyber threats and physical threats and the rise of politically-motivated data leaks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response, organizations can better mitigate risks and proactively combat future threats by applying lessons learned from the past year, and by gaining a greater understanding of these threats to prepare for what's ahead.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Toward that effort, here are some of the top challenges that IT security professionals and their employers should proactively prepare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Take preventative and proactive steps to protect critical infrastructure</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Electrical grids, public transportation systems and other critical infrastructures are becoming increasingly attractive to cyber criminals. The National Infrastructure Advisory Council (NIAC) has warned that public sector and private sector organizations alike are failing to defend critical systems from aggressive cyberattacks. As almost all facets of modern life involve or rely on critical infrastructure, too much is at stake to depend on a reactive approach to cybersecurity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apart from employing predictive technology solutions to combat threats, businesses must implement a continuity plan to ensure operations continue despite interruptions of any kind: power failures, IT system crashes, natural disasters, supply chain problems and more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. When it comes to GDPR, time is of the essence</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) will fundamentally alter the way companies collect and handle the personal data of EU citizens, affecting all U.S. organizations that process, store or secure any type of data on EU citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's important to note that both data processors and data controllers must follow these rules, meaning the cloud and software solutions will not be exempt from GDPR enforcement. GDPR defines a controller as an entity who &quot;determines the purposes, conditions, and means of the processing of personal data,&quot; while the processor &quot;is an entity which processes personal data on behalf of the controller.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the May 25, 2018 GDPR compliance deadline nears, U.S. companies can avoid hefty fines by conducting a comprehensive data storage assessment to ensure they have the adequate data security measures in place and that data protection plans are updated to fulfill GDPR requirements. IT leaders should also prioritize assessing an organization's cloud storage and software solutions for GDPR compliance, which are prone to breaches and may be more challenging to ensure compliance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Don't overlook state-sponsored threats</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For cybercriminals working for foreign entities, any sensitive data is relevant, not just that of government agencies or political figures. The rise of state-sponsored cyber threats has broad implications for every business and their intellectual property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State-sponsored hackers often rely on traditional hacking tactics like spearfishing in an effort to blend in with regular network traffic. Businesses can help protect themselves and their customers by enhancing prevention efforts through layered defenses including routine security testing, threat intelligence, employee education and continuously-monitored breach detection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Gear up for a battle of AI vs. AI</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Artificial Intelligence (AI) is becoming a double-edged sword, with organizations looking to AI to mitigate risk and cyber criminals using the technology to do their work more efficiently and effectively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While leveraging AI capabilities to enhance multifactor authentication and other security measures is critical, companies must understand that hackers can harness the power of AI with malicious intent. Remaining vigilant in following the latest in threats and attacks, as well as critically assessing AI platforms can help organizations balance both the opportunities and the risks of AI.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Recognize the new wave of threats brought on by the Internet of Things (IoT)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the explosion of new connected devices continues, the range of attacks and vulnerabilities will also increase. There may be as many as 25 to 50 billion devices by 2025, according to studies. With the growing interconnectedness of IoT devices, there are too many single-points of failure and sensitive personal information being collected, making these devices prime targets for advanced hacks and ransomware.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While software developers need to anticipate security vulnerabilities, businesses must also integrate IoT-specific precautions into their response plans. System administrators must understand the inventory of where these IoT devices are, their connections and how to update them. Similarly, employees should be trained on the risks of using connected devices to access company-owned information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It should come as no surprise that cyberattacks will only continue to grow in complexity and scope this year and in the years to come.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Almost three-quarters of asset managers polled in a recent study identified cybersecurity as the biggest risk for asset managers in 2018.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seventy-three percent of respondents told fintech firm Koger Inc. that cybersecurity was the primary fear, while 67% said a market correction was the biggest threat. Thirty-eight percent cited geopolitical risks while domestic and international economic downturns posed the biggest threat.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In terms of general risk, cybersecurity emerging as fund managers' top concern is understandable given recent data breaches in other sectors. In fact, 96% of the survey respondents agree that many investment firms could be compelled to cease operations if private e-mails were made public, as has happened in other industries,&quot; Ras Sipko, Koger's chief operating officer, said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report shows 91% of the asset managers it polled have taken steps to align with the new EU General Data Protection Regulation to maintain privacy standards. The GDPR applies to all firms that do business in EU countries and will take effect in May 2018.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Curiously, only 18% have set company policies to comply with regulations to destroy old client data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On a brighter industry note, 77% of the 200 hedge fund and private equity pros questioned in January, said regulatory and compliance issues are a receding and, &quot;less of a concern than in the past.&quot; But 73% the same group believe that a future administration will likel strengthen regulatory enforcement in the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's clear from the data that fund managers see the regulatory and enforcement climate as having eased in the U.S., especially compared with that in the U.K. and Europe. Today's environment has led in the short term to somewhat less of a worry about compliance vs. reputational risk, although that scenario could change in the future,&quot; Sipko said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cryptocurrencies are also front and center in the industry discussions. Sixty-four percent of firms are considering taking on digital currency exposure in the next few years, with roughly half of them doing so within two years. A bit more than a third said they would never deal with the asset class. All expressed concern about reputational and security issues as red flags around Bitcoin and its challengers.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">DEAL SIZE</SPAN><BR></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year was a big year for the enterprise cloud space. Data recently released fromSynergy Research Groupshowed that the cloud market grew to more than $180 billion in 2017 - annual growth of 24 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The role of cloud is changing and maturing to move beyond just infrastructure-as-a-service to become the platform for innovation. As enterprises continue to move their workloads to the cloud, they are seeking higher value services such as artificial intelligence, blockchain and the Internet of Things to help them generate new value from their business data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cloud market is poised for more growth this year, with focus on cloud-native thinking, a renewed emphasis on security and navigating new regulatory frameworks, and driving new innovation through containers, Kubernetes and industry-specific solutions.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As GDPR becomes a reality, cloud security growth and sophistication will skyrocket</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GDPR becomes a reality on May 25, 2018 and will affect companies both in and out of the EU who handle the data of EU citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a GDPR readinesssurvey, almost 40 percent of businesses are fearful of a major compliance failing and the financial penalties for non-compliance are severe. As they navigate the complexities of GDPR, enterprises will double down on cloud security and focus on taking security measures to ensure their cloud apps protect personal data from loss, alteration, or unauthorized processing. In response, cloud service providers will continue to take extraordinary steps to ensure security is at the core of the entire cloud stack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cloud security services will become more sophisticated with advancements to encryption capabilities, the continued integration of AI, and development of security services that work seamlessly across public, private and multi-cloud environments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reaching a tipping point in maturity: containers, Kubernetes, and serverless</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Microservices architectures built on containers and serverless computing have revolutionized the speed at which apps can be built and how they connect into the most competitive technologies today: AI, blockchain and machine learning. This year we will see the adoption of these technologies reach a tipping point. They will move from early adoption to becoming the de facto standard for complex and production-ready apps across industries and companies of all sizes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This shift is being driven by new tools that emerged in 2017 - such as Grafeas, Istio and Composer -- that enable developers to more securely manage and coordinate the many moving parts created by building with containers, serverless and microservices. These tools are enabling greater visibility for the developer including who is working with data, what's being changed, and who has access, leading to better security. The result will be an uptick in the development of mature apps that can span and operate across multiple systems, teams and data streams.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cloud-native thinking will drive a cultural shift that spurs innovation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cloud thinking - both cultural and technical - is the only way forward, and many organizations are moving towards a true cloud-native architecture. As this shift occurs, organizations are embracing new technologies that are increasingly easy to implement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year these changes will also begin to drive greater cultural shifts within these organizations. Technical teams, from data scientists to developers, are now considering questions like, how does my architecture foster innovation by handling the explosion of data from IoT? How can I take advantage of serverless to accelerate development? Is security built in to support blockchain solutions in my industry?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As teams answer these questions, they will begin to transform into a more collaborative and iterative learning-based culture. This shift to cloud-native thinking will drive organizational innovation that brings together professionals with specialized skill sets from app developers, data scientists and data users in brand new ways.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Industry solutions are the future of cloud</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Enterprises have moved beyond pure infrastructure-as-a-service and are turning to the cloud as a platform for innovation and new business value. As enterprises become focused on the bigger picture of what cloud can do for their business, they will look for industry-specific solutions that provide a single architecture from infrastructure all the way up to higher value AI and analytics services as opposed to purchasing piecemeal cloud services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, financial services companies will look to cloud for high performance computing as a service that couples GPU-accelerated infrastructure with embedded AI and deep learning capabilities in a single solution to help them turn the billions of data points they collect into actionable insights.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Silicon Valley companies collect an ever-growing amount of data about their users, a state legislator from Marin County wants to create a California regulatory agency to protect personal information.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Assemblyman Marc Levine, D-Greenbrae, on Monday introduced Assembly Bill 2182, which would create the California Data Protection Authority (CDPA) to regulate Californians' personal data on the internet. All technology companies that serve Californians on the internet would be regulated by CPDA if the bill becomes law, according to Levine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If enacted, the legislation would form the CDPA to develop regulations that ban social media websites from conducting potentially harmful psychological experiments on users, create ways for Californians to erase certain profiles and personal information, and standardize online user agreements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bill needs to be approved by an Assembly committee before it is put to a vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bill's provision for banning harmful psychological experiments on social media platforms stems from a widely criticized Facebook study published in 2014, in which it refuted the notion that positive posts from friends negatively affected the user's emotions. Facebook apologized for the study, which the Guardian newspaper reported was conducted without the consent of nearly 700,000 users.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We think users should know about software being manipulated by a company without consent,&quot; said Levine. &quot;This is nefarious and evil toward consumers they monetize from using their data.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Levine introduced the bill amid growing sentiment from politicians, academics and even some tech leaders that large technology companies need to be more strictly regulated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In November, three U.S. senators introduced a federal bill to require large online platforms such as Facebook, Google and Twitter to maintain public files of political ads for transparency. All three companies did not respond to a request for comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Levine similarly introduced a bill last month to require all bot accounts on social media platforms to be identified and verified with a disclaimer, and to require all social media advertising purchases to be linked to verifiable humans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the federal level, regulating online content falls to either the Federal Communications Commission or the Federal Trade Commission, depending on the situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inspired by the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a new and expansive set of data privacy regulations set to be implemented this May, Levine said he believes California can usher in a new model for protecting Americans' personal data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The federal government has been useless and powerless,&quot; said Levine. &quot;California has a role to play and can be a model for federal law.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether it's process, practice and/or technology, IT security is not something that should ever be put on the back burner, particularly with all of the data breaches of late.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adding to that, with the ongoing and new security compliance regulations coming into force, data breaches present much more than data loss to a business. They bring significant financial and reputation implications as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, what best practices can your organization implement to help secure your businesses' data? Following is a recommended checklist:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Refresh/Realign/Recommit to Data Governance as Part of Corporate Strategy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To protect the data your organization holds, it is critical to follow a data governance model. There are four pillars to this: define, implement, enforce and revisit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When defining your model, it's essential to make the strategy simple. It should clearly outline the rules and regulations within the company as well as the regulations and compliances that affect your business. To help ensure the model is followed, it's critical to secure board and C-suite buy-in at the outset, and establish internal committees to help with the process. Don't forget to determine what granular control policies, persistent encryption, conversion needs, etc. are required to make this a success as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To implement this, you need to identify your encryption and key management solution and establish and apply identify and access control policies. When enforcing the data governance model, it's key to track all of your data - live, cloned, replicated, deleted virtual machines, etc. - and know where it is at all times. Auditing and reporting procedures should be established, and all users should be trained on policies. Communication must be clear and regular.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With regards to revisiting the model, set a lifecycle for this and stick to it. There's no better time than now to ensure your data governance model is relevant and aligned appropriately with your business and that it is agreed to and followed from the top down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Ensure Your Business is Ready to Address new Security Compliance Regulations</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It seems like there's always a new security compliance regulation coming out, and your business needs to be adequately prepared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, with enforcement of EU GDPR around the corner, nearly every IT vendor has something to say about it. However, it's important to keep in mind that few organizations will be starting from scratch, considering that data protection laws have been in place across Europe for years, and many organizations will be complying with existing standards, e.g., PCI DSS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, assess what, where and how EU resident personal data is stored, processed and transferred within and outside your organization's structure. Check every department from marketing to HR, legal and IT. Then, determine where the GDPR gaps are, fill in those gaps with appropriate business practices and protective safeguards, and take a proactive and engaged approach with regular risk assessments and ongoing employee awareness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Protect the Data Center</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Data centers are evolving. They are no longer simply server banks used for simple back-ups, disaster recovery or server processing. Many enterprises are transitioning their infrastructure to become virtualized, and most have begun shifting workloads to the cloud. While simple in concept, and ultimately a cost-saving and agility-producing measure, there are significant complexities with changing out IT infrastructure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Migrating workloads from older systems to newer ones can also create a maelstrom of incompatibilities and security issues if done in patchwork fashion. Solutions such as hyper-convergence which combine compute, storage and networking into one solution are being quickly adopted as a means to efficiently consolidate data center infrastructure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But what about consolidating data security solutions?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The potential trouble with these newer &quot;data center models&quot; is that virtual machines and solutions are often much easier accessed than in the physical world. Easier access generally results in less control. That is particularly dangerous when it comes to controlling sprawl and migration of your critical data and workloads using a mix-match of data security solutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given this, it's critical to ensure you have one data security approach that provides persistent virtual machine-level encryption, so that no matter where workloads are located within the environment - active use, dormant, offline or in backup - the data remains protected. It's also necessary to prevent unapproved copying and snapshots and relocation of virtual machines outside of your boundaries to protect your data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Create Virtualization and Cloud Checkpoints</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the greater use of virtualization and cloud solutions comes the potentially greater risk of data loss as mentioned. To help protect data in virtualized environments and the cloud, it's key to establish and enforce policies specific to where data can be accessed, used and stored. Also, revisit and, as necessary, refresh who has access to the virtual machines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, check that you have the necessary tools to audit, discover and manage virtual machine encryption to reduce the risk of unprotected workloads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, make sure you maintain a centralized repository of encryption keys, separated from the hypervisor, to provide your enterprise with exclusive control of your keys and eliminate the risk of exposure to unauthorized parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Don't Forget About Endpoint Security</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most organizations have a myriad of operating systems and devices (e.g., Windows, Apple, Linux, USBs, self-encrypting drives, etc.). These all come with separate management and reporting tools, with varying levels of data security protections. This disparate array of solutions becomes further problematic when it comes to managing things like software upgrades. Enterprises need to look at ways to gain efficiencies in their endpoint environments, while improving data security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By unifying endpoint data security solutions you can put yourself in a position to be agile enough to make decisions regarding investment in emerging technologies. You'll also benefit from continuous protection of data and workloads wherever they travel within the approved environment and reduced cybersecurity protection premiums with unified controls and visibility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Data breaches will continue to be a significant threat for organizations across the board.</SPAN></P>

The feature does not include merchant accounts, and hasn't been publicly announced since it's not yet widely available, TechCrunch reports. The company has been working with banks such as State Bank of India, ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank and Axis bank to build mobile payments technology for a while, according to TechCrunch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stealth Skimmer: Pottsgrove, Pa., police are looking for two suspects in connection to a card and PIN skimmer in checkout lanes at regional Aldi supermarkets. The men are using a hard-to-spot version of skimmers that &quot;overlay&quot; the top of the customer-facing card terminal, reports security writerBrian Krebs. Krebs writes the skimmer is hard to spot because they install in less than a second by placing the skimmer on top of point of sale terminals. The skimmers capture the consumer's debit card PIN.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the Web</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nordic banks may team up on payments as competition heats upReuters | Fri Feb 9, 2018 - The Nordic region's biggest banks may form a joint regional system to facilitate payments, they said on Friday, in the latest sign of cooperation to stave off competition from fintech upstarts and Silicon Valley giants. Recent regulatory changes in Europe open up parts of the banking market to companies that were not traditionally part of the industry, including the likes of Facebook and Amazon, triggering more competition for incumbents. Despite close ties between Sweden, Norway, Finland and Denmark, the Nordic countries' current payment infrastructure is highly fragmented along national borders, the region's banks said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UK's Hogg Robinson gets AmEx GBT takeover offer, to sell unit to VisaReuters | Fri Feb 9, 2018 - British business travel company Hogg Robinson Group said American Express Global Business Travel (GBT) made a recommended offer for the company and that it agreed to sell its payments technology business, Fraedom, to Visa Inc. Hogg Robinson said GBT would pay up to 120 pence per share, which according to Reuters calculations would value the company at up to 393.1 million pounds ($549.6 million), a nearly 54 percent premium to the stock's close on Thursday. U.S. credit card issuer American Express Co has a 50 percent holding in American Express GBT. Visa said it would pay 141.8 million pounds for Fraedom. However, if the Fraedom sale does not complete prior to a court meeting to approve the AmEx GBT takeover, Hogg Robinson said its shareholders would receive a minimum consideration of 110 pence per share in cash. Visa said separately that it expected the Fraedom deal to close in the first quarter of 2018.</SPAN></P>

Today, we have blockchain projects raising hundreds of millions of dollars with little more than a whitepaper - no product, no traction, just an idea and some technical specifications. You don't need to be in venture capital to understand this level of speculation is unsustainable. At the same time, however, we saw much the same in the early stages of the internet, and look where we are today.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If U.S. payments and financial services companies are able to show that an individual's data is not held all in one place at one time - thus removing a major target for hackers - it would go a long way toward making them compliant with strict new regulations from the European Union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TheGeneral Data Protection Regulationcalls for &quot;pseudonymization&quot; of data - storing an individual's information in separate files - and assesses hefty fines for non-compliance. It takes effect May 25 and also gives consumers the power to dictate who can use that data and when.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The overriding idea behind this is the old adage of 'don't put all of your eggs in one basket,'&quot; said Kory Willis, senior director of IT at Impartner, a South Jordan, Utah-based partner relationship management software provider, under which it adheres to GDPR data policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When hackers gain access to a network, they usually do so one system at a time, Willis said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It takes time to gain access to the next system and then the next,&quot; he added. &quot;The longer they are in a system, the greater chance that something is going to detect their presence and cut them off.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In many ways, the goal of the GDPR is to increase difficulty for a hacker, while also flipping the rights of data ownership back to the European consumer. U.S. companies that serve European consumers are obligated to follow the regulations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To ensure compliance, a payments company might keep a consumer's name separate from his address or payments credentials. For those companies that hold Social Security numbers, those would never appear in the same database as a consumer's other information under GDPR guidelines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If payment processors, merchants or others who hold financial information or consumer databases have followed just the standard security of having firewalls in place and segmentation and various layers of security, there is still a good chance they might have all of that personal information in one place,&quot; Willis said. &quot;Once the hacker reaches the database, they are in and have everything they need.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pseudonymization of data also protects a company against &quot;the office database administrator who feels he is not getting paid enough, and he downloads the database and walks off with it,&quot; Willis added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Key requirements within the GDPR that complement pseudonymization call for companies to store master records and the identification key or token in separate systems - and divide access to those among different people. In practice, no one person should be able to get to all of the identifiable information without someone else being involved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's the accountability and transparency requirements of GDPR that make it stand out as having more teeth than other existing data protection regulations in Europe, said Ron van Wezel, an Amsterdam-based senior analyst with Aite Group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anonymization, pseudonymization and encryption are important techniques to reduce the risk of disclosure and breach of personal data,&quot; van Wezel said. &quot;Companies should implement such techniques to reduce risks as much as possible and protect themselves in case of a data breach.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Payment Card Industry data security standards address the use of third-party vendors, helping acquirers and merchants know how to determine the vendors' PCI compliance, while also recommending the names of those who are compliant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the same vein, the GDPR puts the onus on companies to make sure that their third-party vendors are compliant with the new European rules.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In past years, when a third party got hacked, the company that originally gave them the data could throw their hands up and blame them,&quot; Impartner's Willis said. &quot;With GDPR, it becomes the company's problem in making sure they have vetted third-party providers properly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Overall, GDPR is forcing European and American companies to rethink how they handle data and how their organizations are structured to do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What GDPR does, more than anything, is it takes security and confidentiality from something that just IT worries about to something the entire company worries about,&quot; Willis said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vol. 1</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">No. 1</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The countdown is on. With less than four months until the General Data Protection Regulation goes into effect, time is ticking for businesses to get their email security and archive solutions ready.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By May 2018, any organization handling E.U. resident information will be responsible for maintaining compliance within GDPR - and email is often an overlooked component. More than 90 percent of cyberattacks start with email - whether it's from customers, partners or colleagues, organizations collect hundreds, if not thousands, of emails that contain personal information every day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Considering the current cybersecurity landscape, none of that data is safe - even your deleted files. And all of it is vulnerable to attack, which ups the risk for getting hit with noncompliance penalties.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, how can your business ward off hefty fines and ensure compliance? For starters, make archiving an essential part of your compliance plans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Make archiving an essential part of your compliance plans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When GDPR goes into effect, organizations will need quick and easy access to their email - both current and historical files. This includes trashed and archived emails, which aren't always simple to find.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the archiving solutions of yesterday are outdated; they're difficult to use and extremely time-consuming. For most businesses, email first-pass review isn't going to cut it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RecentVanson Bourne global researchfound that 56 percent of respondents are plagued by slow search performance, with 50 percent claiming archive searches can take up to five minutes. Of that, twenty percent say it can take as long as 10 minutes. While first-pass review is an important part of the eDiscovery process, there are strict deadlines and more priority tasks to be tended to, meaning the amount of time and admin can spend reviewing and searching is tight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fortunately, architecting a security, privacy, and governance solution for email can be fast and simple. Use the following checklist to ensure your archiving solutions are in top notch shape before GDPR is here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consider the chains of custody</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Audit trails, referred to as &quot;chains of custody&quot; by some, are an essential piece of the puzzle when it comes to rounding out your archiving solution. It's important to know who owns, moves and accesses archived data to quickly recall specific files. Be sure to keep track of the five Ws (who, what, where, when and why), so you can easily identify the location and contents of potentially private or personally identifiable information in a jiff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Determine who holds the keys to the castle</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a time crunch and can't access the files you need to? Archiving solutions should make it simple for users to approve (and disapprove) who has the ability to directly access and recall specific files. In today's mobile world, being able to securely recall those files via email, the web or mobile without breaking a sweat can decrease search times, improving overall search capabilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leap to the cloud</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Has your team moved to a cloud-based solution yet? If the answer's no, you're not alone, but you may soon be. Cloud adoption is up - and archiving is becoming a popular use case. Today, utilizing the cloud for archiving solutions saves the budget and your employees time. And in the future, unified access to a cloud-based archive will pay benefits in business intelligence and analytics. So, say goodbye to the days of updating outdated hardware and increasing storage capacities, while still keeping that data protected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Make teamwork a priority</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Think the IT team is responsible for archiving? Think again. Everyone in the organization, from the C-level down, should be involved in the process. Teams must work together to define each of the different files that are being archived, and determine their sensitivity and retention period to develop the best protection plan. Without this collaboration, there's a good chance files will go &quot;missing.&quot; And getting them back will require extensive resources - time and money - to recover.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the GDPR deadline looms closer, use this checklist as a basis to ensure your organization is prepared.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the fast-paced world of digital marketing, staying on top of all the changes can be overwhelming - not to mention trying to weed out lasting trends from fast-fading fads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here are the trends to watch for in 2018 and how to include new trends in your marketing strategy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biggest trend of 2017 that will continue to be a factor</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Video was one of the biggest trends last year and will continue to evolve and grow in 2018. Live video continued to gain in popularity, and for good reason.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's one of the most interactive ways to connect with an audience in real-time and allows for a new level of personalization that brands haven't seen before. People love watching live video, too - 80 percent would rather watch live video from a brand than read a blog.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The amount of time spent watching video on mobile will continue to grow. Mobile video consumption around the world is expected to grow by 25 percent and will decline on laptops and desktop computers for the first time ever. Typically, when we see a mobile usage trend surpass desktop like this we don't see a return.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consequently, this will push mobile video ad spending past non-mobile. Mobile video spending is expected to grow 49 percent to nearly $18 billion, while fixed online video ad spending will decline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marketers should plan ahead for these trends by ensuring their video strategy includes live video and mobile optimization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What will change the most?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We saw a lot of big changes around &quot;search&quot; in 2017, and I anticipate that we'll continue to see more in the coming year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A lot of this change was driven by the way people are searching for information online, including the rise of mobile and voice search through personal assistants, like Siri and Google Assistant, and smart speakers, like Amazon Echo and Google Home. These new devices make it easier than ever for people to simply ask a question and get information from their device.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year, 20 percent of online searches were conducted through voice search. By 2020, that number is expected to increase to 50 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marketers must continue to adapt the content they're creating to be more mobile-friendly and should consider a dual strategy for SEO optimization, including one for text-based searches and one for voice searches, which should incorporate more conversational language and long-tail keywords.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What will take priority?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Privacy protection will be a major priority. With the arrival of new privacy regulations around the world, brands that sell to customers in Europe and beyond must be prepared to comply.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The European General Data Protection Regulation will redefine what online privacy means for brands. Under the GDPR, they will face erasure requirements regarding customer information and restrictions about how prospect data is collected and used for marketing initiatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Furthermore, 2017's massive data breaches - from the DNC email hack to the Equifax breach - have impacted how consumers everywhere think about their privacy and security. Moving into this year, marketers will begin using privacy protection and data security as a value proposition across all industries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brands should ensure that:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Their websites are secure (by using SSL).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Their privacy policy is up to date.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're proactively, transparently and effectively communicating what they're doing to protect customer data.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Patrick McFadin</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vol. 1</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">No. 1</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">982  words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Artificial intelligence has risen to be a top-of-mind topic for many business and IT executives, and we can expect even more interest focused around it this year. But the hype and the reality of AI do not always match. Here are a few trends that we can expect to see in the areas of analytics and AI.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AI will go deep into the &quot;trough of disillusionment&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gartner's Hype Cycle describes the journey that many new technologies will experience, looking at maturity and adoption of technologies and applications and their relevance to solving real business problems and uncovering new opportunities - through five phases from initial invention to long-term adoption.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Artificial intelligence, like many new technologies, will enter the &quot;trough of disillusionment&quot; - where real-world deployments and testing projects encounter problems, and where the current capabilities of existing tools do not align with described benefits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the most prominent users of these technologies, like Facebook and Google, will continue to forge on, making AI look easy, the rest of the world will find it difficult to develop more than the most basic machine learning projects. As such, the companies without the deep experience of AI and the talent to support it, simply won't see the same results as the larger players.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The impact of this could lead to a wide polarization around AI, where the leaders will generate massive amounts of value for themselves while those unable to capitalize on the benefits of AI, will be left struggling - making the role of the open source community around machine learning libraries critical.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stream processing will become &quot;business as usual&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Using application components with limited instruction sets to act on data as it is produced, or Stream Processing, will become more commonplace - over more traditional batch processing and analytics. This near real-time processing will become more and more important for application development teams, as stream processing offers that flexibility and faster response on data. Open source projects like Apache Kafka and Apache Spark will continue to grow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We'll see stream processing get built into standard backend and operational databases, making it easier to implement it at scale, while still supporting the storage and management of data over time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fear of lock-in will be more endemic</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even as concerns around data security of cloud platforms reduce, accidents and misconfigurations will continue to occur - but these are more user error than the fault of the cloud vendors themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, as more companies move to the cloud, the fear around cloud will shift more so to IT infrastructure and architecture strategies becoming reliant on these big public cloud providers. CIOs will see cost increases from their providers, and must enter into this with the understanding that any commitment may lead to lock-in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response to this, 2018 will be the year that CIOs fully embrace multi-cloud strategies. 2017 saw many start that journey and this is just a logical expansion of that thinking. Running across multiple cloud vendors will deliver the scale and flexibility benefits that companies are looking for, without being tied to the vision and costs of just one company. If a vendor starts charging more, then data can be transferred to other providers or back to on-premises, internal IT, depending on the most appropriate economic models.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CIOs will look to keep their providers honest as competition heats up by employing a multi-cloud strategy rather than being tied to single cloud platforms. Balancing the mix of Service Level Agreements, ongoing bills and data management and distribution across multiple cloud platforms, while still serving the same applications will be an Enterprise Architect's dream come true.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Graph will mature and expand at scale</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Graph databases will continue to grow and mature in 2018, from a niche set of specific implementations around data interrogation and relationship modelling, through to powering significant and web-scale applications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Businesses can use graph to better know their customers and the relationships between them. By modelling family relationships within accounts, companies can prevent slips that otherwise affect customer experience. But this ability to track customer data and records over time should be even more useful as we approach the date for compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in May 2018.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Digital transformation will be less about cloud, more about competition</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the 1980s, US towns feared the Walmart Effect, where the area's existing small businesses were decimated by the arrival of cheap, big-box supermarkets. Today, there is a similar fear growing around the digital equivalent, the Amazon Effect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With this in mind, businesses recognize and will need to be more cognizant of how important company data is when it comes to digital transformation and competition. Rather than simply moving to cloud platforms - cloud infrastructure run by the very companies that could pivot or extend their market reach by becoming competition - traditional enterprises will need to and are looking at how to maintain &quot;Data Autonomy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This fear of multi-faceted competition will become the main driver for large digital transformation projects in 2018, as those businesses want to roll out more modern applications while still keeping control over their data. As an example, in 2017 Walmart restricted anyone doing business in thier online marketplace from using anything in Amazon Web Services. Target made the decision to migrate out out AWS citing competition. This will continue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2018, more and more brands will pursue data autonomy through a multi-cloud strategy in order to compete and stay ahead of those big public cloud vendors - and the need and urgency to challenge these big cloud players head on with data-driven applications will intensify.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's clear that the next evolution of enterprise investment will be dedicated to the automation of business workflows. More specifically, investment will be targeted on the augmentation of human operations with machine learning and artificial intelligence, or ML/AI.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This investment is predicated upon the notion that business-critical insights will derive from powerful, complex algorithms crunching huge amounts of data, creating the speed and efficiency to out-compete, or at least keep pace with, new technology-driven competition (Hint: I'm thinking of Amazon).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The move towards ML/AI is not about yet another database, or about consolidating all of your data into a single &quot;analytics&quot; environment. This development will be focused on addressing a long backlog of critical business questions that need answers, which previously took humans too long to address or required data far too complex for humans to digest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first big movement will be in the data science platform space. Enterprises will invest heavily in next-generation predictive tooling, much like they have in business intelligence tools over the past 10 years. The torch will be passed to companies like DataRobot, which automates machine learning for advance business analysts, and to Dataiku, which simplifies the data scientists' prototyping environment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While all of this is good news, there is a catch: the rise of AI as a mainstream enterprise technology has real potential to drive greater misuse of corporate data. Take Equifax for example, where poor handling of customer data led to the firing of C-Suite executives, and not just the CISO.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the first time, to my knowledge, the entire executive suite within major corporations will have to ask hard questions about data protection, regulations, cyber insurance, and more. Their jobs will literally depend on it. Risk will take on a whole new meaning to corporate executives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ultimately, however, the AI hype cycle is doing a real disservice to a number of organizations by obscuring the importance of risk, setting them up for failure in 2018. Too many executive are, for example, myopically focused on being &quot;AI-driven&quot; without focusing on what data is fueling their algorithms, how that data is being managed, and the corresponding risk is of each algorithm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Historically, through business intelligence tools and reporting, enterprises could go back and fix issues within their data repositories. Master data management (MDM) and self-service data preparation ballooned under this premise, where users would &quot;update&quot; data within data warehouses. For all intents and purposes, this model worked. It became easy and painless to fix BI reports - most are easy to interpret and users can work backwards to find the data and fix any problems that may emerge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problem with ML/AI is that data scientists need access to a lot of raw data from many disparate systems. Each one of those systems implements rules on the data without centralized, understandable policies controls. And each algorithm is frequently treated like its own snowflake, with no single source of understanding, data access or control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This approach to risk management frequently stymies data science projects, holding data science programs back and stifling innovation in the exact departments tasked with innovating. Data project are often delayed, for example, until data science teams finalize per-project policies on the data they need and how it can be used.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once approved data is accessed, the slow speed by which data is processed and the distributed nature of the results typically means that it's too late to go back and fix erroneous data once any errors are discovered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Making matters worse, data science teams quickly lose insight and understanding into how many of their models are making decisions. If rules on the data change, the impact on models isn't trivial. Frequently, the model must be brought down, re-trained, evaluated for accuracy, and then re-deployed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Understanding these risks up front is going to be critical for enterprises in 2018. The most successful organizations will not only leverage machine intelligence to make better, more accurate decisions, but they will do it ways that foster the durability of models and minimize their risk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This can be done by evaluating the metadata pushed into the model and determining the likelihood that the rules on that metadata could be impacted. Frameworks likeLIME, which provide insight into the model itself, will be a major factor in helping companies understand where their algorithms create new sources of risk. If a highly risky piece of metadata is heavily weighted within a model, algorithms may have to be reevaluated or re-written, potentially creating operational impacts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Put simply, ML/AI is coming. The best companies will look at risk early and begin to adopt processes focused on managing the risk of their AI. This will be done by bringing lawyers and data scientists together, especially within companies affected by the EU's GDPR, which will begin to be enforced in May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Model review boards will be a common gathering across IT, line of business, and executive suites.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As of May 25, 2018, U.S.-based businesses that have operations in the European Union (EU) or that employ citizens of EU nations will have new requirements to meet regarding data protection. This is when the new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) takes effect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Any companies not prepared to meet the new regulations that experience a data breach could face massive fines. Agents selling group plans, benefit or retirement packages to companies with EU employees that will subsequently store personal information on those employees could also be affected.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Related: 3 ways HR and benefits managers can mitigate cybersecurity risks</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GDPR was designed to better protect EU citizen data and ensure companies storing that data should possess it. Standards vary based on where the data originates from, but generally any information like name, address, credit card number, etc., is covered. In the domestic U.S., protected data is defined as Personally Identifying Information (PII). And, as defined by GDPR, for an EU citizen it is known as Personal Data. Failure to protect the PII or Personal Data to the right standard could bring a hefty bill, or upon consistent failure, even an order to cease business in EU countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Current U.S.-based data privacy regulations require companies to notify customers if a data breach occurs, but in the U.S., there can be a significant time delay between the breach and the notification letter; not so with GDPR. GDPR requires the Supervisory Authorities be notified within 72 hours, even while a breach is still being investigated. Failure to report within 72 hours could lead to significant fines. Maximum fines could be up to $26M or 4 percent of global gross revenue, whichever is greater.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Insurance companies selling plans to U.S.-based businesses with EU citizen employees or operations in EU nations could be affected because they gather Personal Data from EU subjects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, a U.S. technology company has an office in San Francisco and another office in London. Some EU citizens work in both locations for that company and they are all offered the company group insurance coverage and benefits package. The company collects information on its employees such as name, birth date, social security number, and other data points required to for those individuals to apply for insurance coverage and passes it along to the firm. Under GDPR, if the company or the insurance agency does not properly encrypt this information and a hacker is able to steal an EU citizen's Personal Data, a violation of the regulations has occurred.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first step toward compliance for any company is determining the need for and if necessary, assigning a Data Protection Officer (DPO). A company will be required to have a DPO if it possesses large amounts of data covered by GDPR. The DPO must be available and involved in any events where there is a possibility of a loss of GDPR covered data. The DPO will be the point person for any GDPR issue with the affected persons and the Supervisory Authority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obviously, because the DPO will be instrumental in proving a company's compliance with GDPR this individual needs to know the regulations and the company's security protocols inside and out, backward and forward. If a company is not required to have a DPO, it should still have a plan in place for who it will call if the Supervisory Authority opens an investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Additionally, any Personal Data that is lawfully received, stored or processed by a company needs to be encrypted. This means completely encrypted at rest and in transit, complete end to end encryption. GDPR does not allow for leniency regarding outdated software or new implementations that are being investigated for deployment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Companies will also now be required to complete Data Protection Assessments and Privacy Impact Assessments. They will be expected to increase visibility into what level of impact a breach might have for customers and the company, if one occurs. And, all efforts made to comply with GDPR need to be documented so they can be given to a Supervisory Authority upon request.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The best source of information on the regulation requirements is gdpr-info.eu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once GDPR takes effect, if a company experiences a breach or is contacted by a GDPR Supervisory Authority the best course of action is to show an attitude of compliance by offering complete support for the investigation. Then, contact the legal team. It is important to remember that complying with GDPR can be complex. It takes some time to update systems and processes to the level of security required by the new regulations. It can also be costly, and disruptive, but the protection of data is becoming paramount in the new business paradigm. For GDPR the cost of compliance is geared to be less than the cost of sanctions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thinking of a career change? If you're technologically inclined, you might want to consider the position of data protection officer, especially if you're looking for a quick boost in pay.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Data protection officer (DPO) is a relatively new career option, and Reuters  reports that when people first started training to become DPOs, there really wasn't all that much demand for people qualified to manage the legal and ethical issues related to handling customer data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But all that's changed, thanks in large part to a European law that has businesses the world over suddenly scrambling to find people who can fill the role. The European Union's General Data Protection Regulation, which goes into effect in May, requires that all companies whose core activities include substantial monitoring or processing of personal data hire a DPO. The goal is to provide European citizens more control over their online information, and the law applies to all firms that do business with Europeans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Related: 3 ways HR and benefits managers can mitigate cybersecurity risks</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An estimate from the International Association of Privacy Professionals puts the growing need at truly amazing levels, with more than 28,000 DPOs needed in Europe and the U.S. and as many as 75,000 globally-all as a result of GDPR-with data-rich industries, such as tech, digital marketing, finance, healthcare and retail at the forefront of recruiting. In fact, Uber, Twitter, Airbnb, Cloudflare and Experian, according to the report, are already advertising online for DPOs; so are Microsoft, Facebook, Salesforce.com and Slack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I would say that I get between eight and 10 calls a week about a role [from recruiters],&quot; Marc French, DPO of Massachusetts e-mail management company Mimecast, is quoted saying in the report. He adds, &quot;Come January 1 the phone calls increased exponentially because everybody realized, 'Oh my god, GDPR is only five months away.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DPOs are required by GDPR to assist their companies on data audits for compliance with privacy laws, as well as to train employees on data privacy and serve as the point of contact for European regulators. The law also obligates companies to make personal information available to customers on request, or delete it entirely in some cases, and report any data breaches within 72 hours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The demand for DPOs has not only boosted interest in data privacy training, according to Sam Pfeifle, content director of the IAPP, which introduced a GDPR Ready program last year for aspiring DPOs, but has caused a rush on training for would-be candidates for the position. In the report, Pfeifle is quoted saying, &quot;We already sold out all of our GDPR training through the first six months of 2018.&quot; He adds that the IAPP saw a surge in new memberships in 2017, from 24,000 to 36,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And poaching is common, and likely to become more so, as companies in desperate need of a DPO try to lure one away from an existing job-many of which are in Germany. Berlin ad-targeting startup Simplaex's CEO, Jeffry van Ede, is quoted saying, &quot;Everyone is looking for a DPO. I need to have some cash ready for when someone tries to take mine so I can keep him.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Microsoft last week gave Windows 10 testers a peek at an app that shows exactly what diagnostic data the company collects from customers and transmits to its own servers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The issue of Windows 10's telemetry has dogged the operating system since its debut, with critics taking Microsoft to task for over-zealously harvesting information, for refusing to describe what data it collects, and for preventing customers from opting out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[ Further reading: How to choose the right Windows 10 release channel ]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the release of Windows Insider build 17083 on Jan. 24, Microsoft addressed the criticism about transparency by putting an app, named &quot;Diagnostic Data Viewer,&quot; into the hands of beta participants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Diagnostic Data Viewer is a Windows app that lets you review the diagnostic data your device is sending to Microsoft, grouping the info into simple categories based on how it's used by Microsoft,&quot; wrote Dona Sarkar, a software engineer in the company's Windows and Devices group, and the spokeswoman for the Insiders program. Although currently available only to Insiders, the viewer is scheduled to appear in the next Windows 10 feature upgrade, set to launch in March or perhaps early April, and likely identified in Microsoft's yymm format as 1803.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Diagnostic Data Viewer could be downloaded from the Microsoft Store, the authorized source of Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps. Only those running Windows 10 build 17083 or later were able to successfully install the app.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Sarkar, the viewer shows &quot;the exact data uploaded to Microsoft&quot; and lets users search for specific diagnostic events as well as filter the events for one or more broad categories, such as &quot;Product and Service Usage&quot; or &quot;Software Setup and Inventory.&quot; In the brief documentation on the app, Microsoft recommends that users turn off the viewer when they're done examining the data, as the act of collection can consume up to 1GB of storage space on the device.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[ To comment on this story, visit Computerworld's Facebook page. ]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Microsoft's introduction of the Diagnostic Data Viewer was an expansion of the April 2017 move that revealed more about what information Windows 10 collects. Before that, in January 2017, Microsoft made minor concessions, saying it would reduce what was collected when users selected the &quot;Basic&quot; setting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it's highly unlikely that the new app signals Microsoft will yield to its customer critics, said Michael Cherry, an analyst at Directions on Microsoft. Instead, Cherry argued, it was probably prompted by the company's continued discussions with European Union (EU) member states' officials about the impending General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which goes into force in May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under GDPR, companies must obtain explicit consent from their customers for any use of personalized information, Cherry added. &quot;You have to give full and complete disclosure of what you're collecting, and how long you're collecting it for,&quot; he said. &quot;And people have to opt in. That's still not a part of Windows 10.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Microsoft's motivation can be traced to GDPR and its demands, Cherry went on. &quot;There has been no market resistance [to Windows 10's data collection] or legislation here about it, so it's reasonable to conclude that it's due to the GDPR. But whether it's sufficient will be up to them [the EU member states' data protection agencies].&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cherry expects Microsoft to fiercely defend its telemetry practices, even as the company makes incremental concessions on secondary fronts, because the data is crucial to how Microsoft now services Windows. &quot;Because so many people are relying on Windows Defender as their antivirus, [Microsoft] needs a certain amount of telemetry to keep that and security updates working,&quot; Cherry said. &quot;They need to know that the latest antivirus signature has been applied. [And on security updates] they need to know how many people have applied a patch.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">January's news that most processors contained vulnerabilities - identified using the nicknames &quot;Meltdown&quot; and &quot;Spectre&quot; - was a perfect example. Last weekend, after Intel had warned customers, including end users, to stop deploying firmware updates for one of the Spectre flaws, Microsoft followed suit, and issued an emergency update that disabled a previous patch for the same Spectre bug. Microsoft would be very interested in knowing how many systems had had that out-of-band patch applied to them, and diagnostic data would show the company exactly that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They would want to know how big the [Spectre patch] exposure was,&quot; Cherry said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Telemetry also plays a critical part in how Microsoft rolls out each Windows 10 feature update, the twice-annual refresh that adds new functionality and may change the operating system's user interface (UI) and/or user experience (UX). &quot;They also need telemetry for the new release cadence. We know they throttle the releases,&quot; said Cherry, referring to the practice of initially issuing an update to a small number of devices, usually those equipped with the latest drivers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Microsoft uses diagnostic data to identify problems; it then makes fixes and expands the pool of potential recipients. &quot;They take a long time before [a release] goes out to every machine,&quot; Cherry pointed out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That said, Cherry praised Microsoft for pulling back more of the curtain with the Data Diagnostic Viewer. &quot;It does change the telemetry debate,&quot; Cherry said. &quot;Before, we were totally blind about what was collected. So, this is a step in the right direction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But while I feel Microsoft is moving in the right direction, it's still insufficient,&quot; Cherry asserted. Microsoft may be revealing more about diagnostic data collecting, but it does so grudgingly. &quot;It's not quite one step forward and two steps back, but it's not a full step forward either,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't deny that collecting information about how the operating system fails doesn't lead to improvements in the OS,&quot; said Cherry. &quot;I understand why they collect data. But why do they have to collect so much?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And that's not something the Diagnostic Data Viewer can explain.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Data scientists need help with managing data policies, complying with evolving regulations, and preparing for the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation. To assist them, Forrester Research released its Wave report - &quot;Data Governance Stewardship and Discovery Providers: The 12 Providers That Matter The Most and How They Stack Up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The study is authored by Forrester analyst Henry Peyret, with assistance from Alex Cullen, Alex Kramer and Sam Bartlett. Here are 12 leading products they reviewed in the data governance and stewardship space.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alation - Alation Enterprise Edition&quot;Alation provides a strong data catalog capability, focusing on supporting analytics and insight,&quot; Peyret says. &quot;A four-year-old company, Alation has positioned itself as an automated data catalog built for collaboration. The vendor provides customizable dashboards and alerts for data stewards. Its typical buyers are chief data officers, vice presidents of analytics or data science, and heads of data governance. Its clients are increasingly asking for more data governance capabilities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ALEX Solutions - ALEX Version 2.23 (2.24 RC1)&quot;ALEX Solutions provides a cloud-based data governance solution designed to support business and technical users,&quot; according to Peyret. &quot;Its key features are structured and unstructured data scanners, profiling, data usage tracking, and simple value and impact ratings. Its offering is able to automatically classify sensitive information and determine which users can access it based on their predefined roles.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BackOffice Associates - Data Stewardship Platform 6.5&quot;BackOffice Associates is an enterprise information data governance and data stewardship solution provider that supports the data management journey from migration, archival, data quality, and analytics to data governance and master data management,&quot; Peyret says. &quot;It provides data scanners, data profiling, data quality, and collaboration, a basic but useful data valuation approach. Currently, BackOffice is addressing new domains for data governance, including complex privacy governance as required by GDPR.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cloudera - Cloudera Enterprise 5.10&quot;Cloudera is designed to support Data Governance 2.0 with collaboration between technical and business users,&quot; Peyret notes. &quot;Its platform provides role-based access and preconfigured dashboards to support different user types. It offers robust support for tracking data governance issues by easily defining policies and determining which data sets are impacted and which events to trigger via the use of automated workflows.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Collibra - Collibra Data Governance Center&quot;Collibra provides a configurable collaborative platform that is designed to meet the needs of 15 different user personas,&quot; Peyret says. &quot;Each user can configure their personal dashboard with the widgets they need. Collibra fits particularly well for data governance teams and chief digital officers. It supports the data governance capabilities needed for GDPR compliance. The catalog part of its offering expands the capabilities for data analysts/scientists to find, access, and collaborate on data sets, and the upcoming data profiling capability and visual exploration will enhance that support even more.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DATUM - Information Value Management&quot;DATUM provides a cloud-based and on-premises data governance platform that evaluates the impact of data on processes,&quot; Peyret explains. &quot;Role-based access ensures that each user has visibility into the metrics and dashboards they need. The platform also focuses on enterprise collaboration to engage subject matter experts in data governance. With a background in services, DATUM offers an accelerator matrix to help customers reach value quickly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Global Data Excellence - DEMS (Data Excellence Management Systems)&quot;Global Data Excellence uses artificial intelligence and semantics to automate data governance, business excellence, and analytics,&quot; Peyret says. &quot;Global Data Excellence leverages advanced university research in semantic models and AI to automate numerous, currently painful manual tasks for DGSD. Its road map focuses on improving its UI for data visualization and enhancing its collaboration tools to support data sharing throughout an organization.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Global IDs - Enterprise Information Management Software&quot;Global IDs focuses on data catalog features with some advanced capabilities for GDPR and data analysts and scientists,&quot; Peyret says. &quot;For GDPR, it can detect personally identifiable information and data that raises privacy concerns after multicolumn aggregation. It lacks data governance capabilities but could complement other tools such as Collibra. It is particularly interesting for large organizations because of its ability to treat millions of columns.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IBM - InfoSphere Information Governance Catalog&quot;IBM is a recognized leader in executing data governance policies, with multiple products covering data quality, MDM, the data life cycle (with Optim), and security (with Guardium),&quot; Peyret says. &quot;In Q4 2014, IBM added a policy management capability called Stewardship Center based on its well-known Business ProcessManager product, available on-premises or as a hosted offering. Stewardship Center enables users to create diverse policies, which are defined in natural language. IBM is moving toward a holistic governance model, which will allow users to view data across business systems and applications.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Infogix - Data Governance Suite&quot;Infogix acquired Data3Sixty in early 2017 to expand its platform and offer support for policies, external and internal data stewards, collaboration, and external data source management,&quot; Peyret explains. &quot;It provides a customized view for each data steward that highlights every conversation or task for which they areresponsible. Infogix also provides an out-of-the-box template for GDPR and is able to implement its solution in 30 to 60 days. It maintains a public product road map and leaves 20% of its capacity unplanned in order to rapidly meet customer demand for new functionality.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Informatica - Enterprise Information Catalog / Informatica Axon&quot;Informatica acquired Diaku in early 2017 to expand its data governance and compliance capabilities,&quot; Peyret says. &quot;Informatica's solution for data governance provides Enterprise Information Catalog (a metadata-driven repository), Axon for collaboration and graphical metrics (including for non-technical business users), Data Quality, and Secure@Source for security purposes.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">By Bernice Napach</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEWS</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Don't just think of ESG factors as representing an opportunity to own assets because of corporate policies and practices concerning the environment or social and governance issues. They can also serve as a warning sign about the risks of owning certain securities, those that score low on the ESG continuum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's the latter approach that Sustainalytics uses in its report &quot;10 for 2018&quot; focusing on &quot;10 ESG risks that could have a significant impact on shareholder value&quot; in 2018 and the industries that are most affected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following are the 10 primary risks discussed in the report, the industries affected and the varied ESG standings of individual companies within those industries.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Hazardous Chemical Releases: Diversified Chemical Companies</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a primary risk for diversified chemicals company and a long-lasting one, according to Sustainalytics. Chemical companies face legal and clean-up expenses and substantial reputational risk. Between 2013 and 2017, 33 diversified chemical firms were linked to 145 incidents involving contamination of land and water, and polluting air emissions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of the 127 global diversified chemicals companies Sustainalytics analyzed, only 6% were well prepared to mitigate hazardous chemicals risks and 57% were poorly prepared. The best prepared were Germany's Evonik Industries and Norway's Yara International; the worst prepared was Chemours, a U.S.-based spinoff from E.I. du Pont de Nemours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Water Use and Community Opposition: Copper Mining</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mining companies are especially vulnerable to this risk, according to Sustainalytics. There are currently more than 200 conflicts between mining companies and local communities in Peru, most concerning water, for example.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Copper mining companies in Chile face similar risks but how they address those challenges differs substantially. Sustainalytics notes that BHP Billiton has and Antofagasta score highest on their water and community risk management capabilities while KGHM Polska scores lowest. Its top pick: Antofagasta Plc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Energy Demand and Greenhouse Gas Emissions: Semiconductor Industry</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Investors may not view this industry as a major air polluter or consumer of vast amounts of energy but they should, especially among companies operating in Asia where 45% of chip production takes place, according to Sustainalytics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of those companies will face energy supply challenges as more Asia countries adopt greenhouse gas emission regulations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., with an 11% share of global fabrication capacity and demonstrated ability to manage power shortages and purchase renewable energy power is well positioned in facing these challenges. Samsung, which has less than half of TSMC's global capacity and a renewables and emissions score close to 30 versus TSMC's 63 is poorly positioned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Carbon Emissions Regulation and Transition Risk: Oil and Gas Sector</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a huge risk for oil and gas companies especially those that are not well diversified, have high production costs and are involved in carbon-intensive projects such as oil sands and Arctic drilling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those producers that &quot;disclose strategies to manage the regulatory market and reputational risks posed by climate change are better prepared to compete in the low carbon transition than firms that do not,&quot; according to Sustainalytics. Recommendations from the Taskforce for Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), headed by Michael Bloomberg, provide a template for those disclosures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sustainalytics gives Royal Dutch Shell (high marks - a perfect score of 100 for greenhouse gas risk management - for being the only oil and gas company that has set carbon reduction targets and for entering the electric vehicle market, but it would like to see more disclosure on how the company intends to evolve its business model. Exxon Mobil (XOM), in contrast, has a score of 50.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crystal Shore look over the wildfire damaged neighbors home along Via San Anselmo in the Sylmar area of Los Angeles Wednesday, Dec. 6, 2017. (AP Photo/Chris Carlson)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Climate Change Risk: Real Estate</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rising sea levels and temperatures plus an increasing number of severe hurricanes and wildfires pose a risk to the real estate industry. &quot;We anticipate investors will continue to express concerns about how the physical impact of climate change could affect the value of their holdings,&quot; according to the Sustainalytics report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The firm assessed 306 listed real estate firms,including REITS, developers and property managers and found that only 19% are well prepared to manage those risks while 51% are poorly prepared. Its analysis of 101 Asa-Pacific real estate firms found that those in Australia scored the highest for managing those risks, led by Stockland and GPT Group, which had scores of 100 and about 82, but many scored at 50 and below.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Antitrust Risk: Major Tech Companies</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dominant software and services firms like Google's Alphabet, Facebook and Microsoft face anti-competitive regulations, especially in Europe, according to Sustainalytics. It cites the 2.4 billion Euro fine levied by the European Commission against Alphabet in June, after which its quarterly net income fell 28%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Microsoft, Intel and most recently Qualcomm have also been hit with hefty antitrust fines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Major technology companies will increasingly need to balance their ambition with their responsibility to the stakeholders,&quot; concludes Sustainalytics.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Health Risks: Sugary Soft Drink Industry</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Concerns about the health risks of excessive sugar consumption are slowing sales at many beverage companies who also face increased regulations and lawsuits, adding pressure to adjust their business models, says Sustainalytics. In addition many jurisdictions around the world have either implemented taxes on the consumption of sugary drinks or are considering doing so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some companies like Danone and Nestle are responding by offering premium healthy drinks, and they receive the highest marks for product health risk management score from Sustainalytics. Coca-Cola, in contrast, scores much lower.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Data Protection Regulatory Risk: Financial and Technology Industries</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Starting in late May any company that collects data from residents in the European Union will be subject to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and noncompliance could result in fines. The regulations are expected to have the biggest impact on financial firms and technology companies, which have the greatest exposure to personal data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AXA, the French insurance company, which bought U.S.-based Equitable Life and MONY years ago, is well prepared to meet the new guidelines and manage associated regulatory risks, says Analytics. AXA has already implemented its own policies to safeguard personal data and has adopted Binding Corporate Rules, an international standard to protect personal data that has been approved by French and European data protection authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Supply Chain Risks: Apparel Companies</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the Rana Plaza collapse in Bangladesh in 2013, which killed over 1,100 people working in several garment factories, apparel producers have faced increased regulatory and public scrutiny over their working conditions. As a result, many have raised wages and increased other expenditures; others have relocated to other regions where they can still hire cheap labor but are still implementing policies to protect labor rights, according to Sustainalytics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Its assessment of 117 global retail, textile and apparel companies al, textile and apparel companies found that only 20% are well prepared to address key supply chain standards and management issues and 54% are poorly prepared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Firms that get tangled in supply chain controversies risk experiencing disruptions to shipments, legal actions by consumers, investors and workers, and increased public scrutiny and reputational damage,&quot; according to Sustainalytics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earning high marks are H&amp;M (100) and Hugo Boss (about 85) and earning low marks are luxury apparel company Hermes (about 22) and Pou Chen (15), the original equipment manufacturer for Nike, Reebok, Asics, New Balance, Converse and Timberland and others</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. Bribery &amp; Corruption Risks: Aerospace and Defense Industry</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Agencies around the world have beefed up enforcement against bribery and corruption, increasing cross-country efforts, and the aerospace and defense industry is a common target.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sustainalytics analyzed 80 global A&amp;D companies and found that 59% are not prepared to address the risks; only 21% are well prepared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One interesting finding was the difference between the scores of Boeing and Embraer, which it's in discussions to acquire. Embraer was fined about $200 million in 2016 by U.S. authorities to settle claims related to violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), including paying third parties to bribe officials in the Dominican Republic, Saudi Arabia, Mozambique and India to secure government contracts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Embraer is now facing class action lawsuits alleging the firm had made material false and misleading statements related to the FCPA investigation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. payments processors, banks and retailers have dealt with the EMV liability shift and various Payment Card Industry security standards in the past, so they know a thing or two about data security - as well as the tightness of compliance deadlines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But their PCI compliance won't be enough to meet the strict requirements of the General Data Protection Regulation, which takes hold May 25 in Europe. Again, far too many companies are neither aware of nor prepared to comply with the various facets of the GDPR, a consumer privacy measure that essentially moves the ownership of data to European consumers and away from companies that compile, store, move or sell data for various purposes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GDPR, announced through the European Union in 2016, is an offshoot of the European Data Protection Act and guards against companies loosely handling data while also allowing EU consumers to &quot;own&quot; the data and know how and where that data gets used.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Being aware of GDPRSenzing, a California-based software technology company, estimates that just the data-collection search aspects of the regulation could amount to 172 hours a month.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company spoke to more than 1,000 companies throughout Europe, concluding that more than 60% of companies are not currently GDPR ready.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is still a general lack of knowledge around GDPR,&quot; said Gareth Lodge, a London-based payments industry analyst with Celent. &quot;I'd be very surprised if we were even at 90% awareness.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a need for companies to be clear on what GDPR means and any overlap it might have with other security or privacy measures, Lodge said. &quot;There are many directives, all written by different parts of the EU, with little in terms of common language.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GDPR represents a dramatic and complex change - especially for U.S. companies that handle European consumers' data. They'll have to change a lot of policies, contract and privacy paperwork, and data management records to reach compliance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under GDPR, companies have to deal with the fact that European consumers, or &quot;data subjects&quot; as they are called under the regulation, are automatically opted out of any commitment to allow use of their data. The consumer holds the power as to whether a company can do anything with the data, including keeping it stored, and has to give permission to do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the U.S., it is the opposite. American companies can use customer data for other means, which they usually explain in privacy notices and other lengthy disclosures that consumers generally ignore. Basically, U.S. consumers automatically agree to allow other data uses, such as for marketing purposes or risk assessment, unless they choose to opt out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A change for payment platforms&quot;In payments, when a processor or issuer is using the data for marketing or promos, or to calculate credit scores, they could be in violation because if you are using European Union citizens' data to monitor and do things, the platforms have to be compliant,&quot; said John Doherty, partner and Americas financial services data protection leader for EY (formerly Ernst &amp; Young LLP).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The handling of data under GDPR will be different from complying with PCI standards, Doherty said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;PCI is basically telling you to protect credit card data, while GDPR is saying we are going to give the consumer the right to manage the data,&quot; Doherty added. &quot;They will have the right to get electronic records, or the right to have their data forgotten and not stored.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Currently, a U.S. credit card processor who has locked down and protected a consumer's payment card and personal data would essentially be able to store that data forever. Under GDPR, a European consumer could request that it be stored only for future payment reference for a period of time, or be taken off the database completely. It could not be used for any other purpose without consent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Along similar lines, Doherty said, European consumers will be able to contact a payment provider, or other data company, and ask where their data is currently stored and what it is being used for. And a company has to immediately respond to that request with accurate information, he added, and many currently may not be able to do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Any requests by EU consumers asking where their data is at a given time could create more pressure on payments companies to &quot;understand critical details regarding their handling of sensitive data,&quot; said Ryan Stolte, co-founder and chief technology officer at the cybersecurity firm Bay Dynamics. &quot;This includes where it is located, where it moves, who interacts with it, as well as how it is being used, and where in the world it is being accessed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As it currently stands, many organizations lack a full understanding of their data, Stolte said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some of it may be in the cloud, some on premise, and all of it accessed by third-party vendors and employees,&quot; he added. &quot;To comply with GDPR, companies should use a combination of behavior analytics and other technologies to better understand who is interacting with payment card data, and from where.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PCI compliance is not enoughSometimes, payments companies have found it is better to wait for clarity than to meet a rulemaker's stated deadline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This will be similar to the EMV chip migration in that many businesses won't really know what to do or how to comply,&quot; said John Barchie of Phoenix, Ariz.-based Arrakis Consulting LLC, which currently specializes in helping companies comply with GDPR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While not directly connected, GDPR will have some crossover similarities with the PSD2 directives in Europe for payment innovation and technology development, as well as the privacy factors of HIPAA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;GDPR is better security in the sense that you know what is going on with the data, but it is not specifying a particular security framework, because those already exist,&quot; Barchie said. &quot;They are saying you need to do these things to enhance the privacy of the data subject, and it just happens to enhance the security measures.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because of PCI security standards and various technologies to protect data, U.S. payments companies are better positioned for GDPR than other data processors might be - but it would be a mistake for a payments company or retailer to think that this process is similar to PCI compliance, because it is more complex than that, Barchie noted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are seeing that it is more than 4,000 hours of work to comply because it is very extensive,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Knowing what to doGDPR calls for the hiring of a data protection officer at companies that handle large amounts of data that fall under GDPR - from addresses and phone numbers to personal information and payments credentials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On the payments side, those companies might be surprised to find that someone is going to regulate you and ask to increase your head count by one,&quot; Barchie said. &quot;But you can take a current manager and make them the data protection officer, which is a full-time job.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A company also has to show it has a legal right to accept, process and store data, and also show it has upgraded software or legacy equipment as needed to address new technology and current data security needs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Data protection and privacy impact assessments have to take place as part of doing business, as well as data mapping that would accurately show how data is received, processed, stored or moved and for what purposes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The data subject, or consumer, has numerous rights - and companies have to comply with their requests. There can be no data access restrictions for consumers, an intentional deletion or denial of data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There can be no caveats attached to seeking permission to use data in ways other than the original intent. A company cannot hold back or deny a service if an EU consumer won't accept a request to use the data in some other fashion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If a consumer ignores a company's request for permission, the company must honor that, Barchie said. This is counter to the typical practice in the U.S., where a consumer's silence could imply permission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Big consequences for noncomplianceAny violation of the handling of GDPR data is subject to fines, the severity measured by the intent of the company. But the fines can be hefty, in the millions of dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unfortunately, companies in danger of facing fines are likely those not fully aware of their data handling or movement - and who are nowhere near ready to comply with GDPR by late May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Any company not fully prepared and engaged in making changes at this time will not be compliant by the deadline. That could be as high as 70% to 80% of U.S. businesses and 50% of EU/U.K. businesses, according to Arrakis Consulting.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SAN FRANCISCO - Facebook says it will launch a new privacy center to help people understand what it does with their data as the giant social network prepares for sweeping new data protection rules in Europe designed to rein in the growing power of major U.S. technology companies.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All privacy settings will be in one place, said Facebook, which also published a set of privacy &quot;principles.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook is bracing for new regulations designed to help Europe's 500 million consumers take back some control over how online businesses use their personal information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Facebook won't be giving its more than 2 billion global users any additional say over what it does with the mountains of personal information Facebook collects to target advertising.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, Facebook's Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg said last week in a speech in Brussels that the new privacy center would &quot;put the core privacy settings for Facebook in one place and make it much easier for people to manage their data.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Sandberg, the changes give Facebook &quot;a very good foundation to meet all the requirements&quot; of the 28-member bloc's new data rules called the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which apply to any company that keeps data on EU citizens. The GDPR restricts what kind of data companies can use and store and what they can do with the data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Set to take effect May 25, the regulations are so stringent that some have warned that U.S. tech companies may have to dramatically alter how they operate or risk fines of 20 million euros, more than $24 million, or 4% of their annual revenue, whichever is greater, if they violate the rules.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook, like other major U.S. tech companies, has deployed dozens of people and spent millions of dollars to figure out how to comply with the new rules. In recent months, the company has held what it calls &quot;design jams,&quot; where staffers brainstorm ways people can get a clearer picture of what's happening to their data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The company is about to find itself scrutinized in Europe and forced to give the public more control over their data,&quot; privacy expert Jeffrey Chester of the Center for Digital Democracy said of Facebook.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new regulations were approved in 2015 after tech companies ran afoul of privacy regulators in individual European countries. They are the latest European headache for Facebook and other technology companies that have for years been taking flak from regulators and lawmakers over taxes, privacy, collection and use of data, and terrorist content.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Facebook is under the gun in the EU,&quot; said Marc Rotenberg, president and executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. &quot;Literally multiple investigations and court cases right now. And the pace will pick up in May when GDPR goes into force.&quot; <BR></SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook announced on Sunday a new push to better explain its efforts to protect user data by sharing its privacy principles for the first time, ahead of a European Union data protection law that takes effect in May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The privacy principles, separate from the company's terms and policies, include a commitment to protect user privacy at the outset of product design and help people understand how their data is used.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The push will also include a series of educational videos that clarify how people can take greater control over their data on the social network. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You have many ways to control your data on Facebook,&quot;  Erin Egan, the company's chief privacy officer, wrote in a blog post Sunday. &quot;This includes tools to make sure you share only what you want with the people you want to see it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The changes are the result of the E.U.'s General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR. Back in 2015, the European Commission created the rules to give European citizens more control over the data collected about them by major tech companies such as Facebook, Google and Amazon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the provisions, tech companies now have to inform regulators within three days after discovery of a data breach. The rules also grant citizens the right to request that certain data about them be removed from the Web. Minors younger than 16 who want to use digital services must first receive parental consent under the new rules. And national regulators will be able to issue fines if companies collect personal data without consent or misuse personal data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Facebook and other Silicon Valley giants, complying with the GDPR may pose greater costs and require additional resources, as their business models rely on the collection and sale of consumer habits online. The rules are significant because they are some of the most robust since the dawn of the Internet, exceeding consumer protections in the United States. As massive tech companies, such as Facebook, Google and Twitter, rely on troves of consumer data to rapidly expand their operations and gain a larger influence in global society, the rules establish the importance of data privacy as a fundamental right. The GDPR will apply to all 28 E.U. member states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Egan said that Facebook will start providing videos to teach users how to review and delete old posts and control the information the social networking platform uses to display ads, and to explain what happens when users choose to delete their accounts. The videos will appear in the News Feed, she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook's announcement comes a week after chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg said that the company will make its privacy settings easier to find. The company said it will launch a new privacy center this year for its 2 billion users, allowing them to change their core privacy settings in a single place on their Facebook accounts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The initiative is an example of how tech industry efforts to comply with the GDPR will spill over to users in the United States. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our apps have long been focused on giving people transparency and control, and this gives us a very good foundation to meet all the requirements of the GDPR and to spur us on to continue investing in products and in educational tools to protect privacy,&quot; Sandberg said at an event in Brussels last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GDPR rules apply both to European companies and to U.S. companies that  collect the data of European residents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The release of these privacy principles was to essentially get ahead of the GDPR,&quot; said Frances Zelazny, vice president of BioCatch, a security company that uses behavioral biometrics. &quot;Facebook knows that if they are not prepared, they could get into trouble down the road.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Europe, Facebook has been the focus of several privacy investigations by government watchdogs in recent years. Closer to home, the company has come under heightened scrutiny over its handling of Russian disinformation campaigns that ran on the social media platform before and after the 2016 presidential election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last week, billionaire philanthropist and leading donor to liberal causes George Soros described Facebook and Google as menacing, monopolistic companies. He urged stricter regulations on dominant technology companies and pointed to the enforcement actions of the E.U. as a model that U.S. regulators should emulate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two months ago, Facebook released a pilot program in Australia that asks people to upload their naked photos to Facebook Messenger so that Facebook can prevent your partner or ex from pulling a &quot;revenge porn&quot; against you in the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, apparently, Facebook wasn't so trusted by its users as it had thought.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;naked photo&quot; idea creeped out its user community. Instead of applause for its careful consideration, the news received a flood of mocking memes and comments of disbelief on social media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This time, Facebook has introduced a much less intimidating program, but the goal is barely different-Facebook wants to know more about you in order to better protect you.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Sunday, Facebook introduced a series of tutorials&nbsp;that show users how to manage privacy settings on Facebook. The tutorials cover topics like showing posts to the public vs. friends, tagging and untagging people in photos and videos, setting a strong password and so on-the majority of which seem common sense to experienced users.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We recognize that people use Facebook to connect, but not everyone wants to share everything with everyone-including with us. It's important that you have choices when it comes to how your data is used,&quot; Erin Egan, chief privacy officer at Facebook, wrote in a blog post.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That said, you still have to share more with Facebook, if you want it to better serve you.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A lesser-known function shown in the tutorials is managing ad preferences in news feed. The tutorial explains how Facebook targets a user as a viewer for certain ads. For example, if a user has shown an interest in cooking through liking chef pages, he/she may see ads from companies that target this group of people in his/her news feed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you don't want to see ads on certain topics, you can uncheck those boxes in ad preferences. But that doesn't necessarily mean you'll see fewer ads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Keep in mind that even after making changes to your ad preferences, you might still see ads that seem related to things you removed. For example, you might see an ad if it's broadly targeted to everyone in your town or city,&quot; Facebook said in the tutorial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, to really avoid unwanted ads, you need to be more specific on things you don't want to see, by checking boxes in preferences or blocking ads-in other words, narrow down on things you </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">want</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to see.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to the tutorials, Facebook published its privacy principles for the first time-seven bullet points starting with, &quot;We give you control over your privacy,&quot; and ending with, &quot;We are accountable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The timing of Facebook's release of privacy principles and tutorials led industry observers to believe that it was merely a PR gesture ahead of the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) which takes effect on May 25.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EU's new regulation requires companies to allow customers to export their data and delete it, if they want. It also&nbsp;drastically increases fines for companies in violation of the data protection law to four percent of a company's annual revenue or 20 million euros, whichever is higher. Based on Facebook's 2017 revenue forecast, that would be a risk worth over $1 billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The last time Facebook dodged a bullet by EU privacy watchdogs was in 2016, when&nbsp;WhatsApp, a Facebook subsidiary, announced a plan to share its user data with parent company Facebook for ad-targeting purposes. The plan drew heated controversy because it conflicted with Facebook's promise to keep operations independent when it acquired WhatsApp in 2014.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The European Commission closed the case with a $122 million fine on Facebook for misleading regulators in the 2014 WhatsApp acquisition. No regulatory actions were taken on the privacy ground.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Data Privacy Dayis held annually on January 28 by theNational Cyber Security Alliancein an effort to create awareness about the importance of respecting privacy, safeguarding data, and enabling trust.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The aim of this day is targeted at helping people around the world understand how their personal information is being collected and used - in addition to understanding how they can keep their data safe from cybercrime. Data Privacy Day commemorates the 1981 signing of Convention 108, the first legally binding international treaty related to data protection and privacy; it was first initiated in Europe in 2007 and was adopted in the US and Canada in 2008.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NCSA is the official champion of Data Privacy Day, and it develops its yearly campaigns with assistance of anAdvisory Committeeof distinguished privacy professionals to ensure that its activities align with the most current issues. For organizations, today's data management and privacy stakes are higher than ever before.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For security leaders, this looks somewhat like a &quot;cause and effect&quot; scenario: lack of security awareness training and risky end-user behaviors can have major financial consequences and other business impacts, including non-compliance implications. There is a bright side, however: organizations can protect their data and avoid costly fines by better managing end-user risks related to phishing and ransomware attacks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cause: Careless End User Habits</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Risky habits present among working adults come in all shapes and sizes, from high clicks rates on real and simulated phishing emails, to low overall awareness on key threats such as ransomware and smishing (SMS/text message phishing).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fourth annualState of the Phish Report, recently released byWombat Security, shows that phishing is still a major threat to be reckoned with. More than three-quarters of the infosec professionals surveyed for the report said they experienced a phishing attack in 2017, and nearly half said the rate of attacks increased since 2016. Couple that with the low levels of cybersecurity knowledge and poor cyber habits also noted among technology users also surveyed for the study, and it's clear that end-user behaviors pose a serious threat to organizations' data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Take general knowledge of ransomware as an example. Despite very regular reports of ransomware attacks in 2017 - including the headline-grabbing global impacts related to WannaCry and NotPetya - the average working-age adult still lacks basic awareness of this type of malware.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State of the Phish Report found that only 55 percent of UK technology users and 46 percent of U.S. technology users could correctly define what ransomware is. German respondents fared even worse, with only 31 percent of the adults surveyed able to correctly identify the definition of ransomware in a multiple-choice query. And awareness related to smishing is quite dismal; in Wombat's survey, only 16 percent of technology users were able to correctly identify what smishing was; 17 percent answered incorrectly, and 67 percent of respondents didn't even hazard a guess.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The implications of these findings on data security are vast. Phishing, ransomware, and smishing attacks regularly compromise data integrity. The State of the Phish Report found that 49 percent of infosec professionals experienced a malware infection as a result of a phishing attack in 2017, an 81 percent increase from 2016.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Furthermore, 38 percent of respondents reported compromised accounts as a result of these attacks and 13 percent experienced data loss. Of those surveyed, half of the respondents reported measuring the cost of a phishing attack on their business through the loss of proprietary information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Infosec teams are doing a number of things to combat phishing threats on the technical side, and these technologies are certainly helpful in preventing some malicious emails from reaching end users. But they can't stop all attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the case of social engineering scams, security is left to a binary &quot;do I or don't I&quot; decision by end users. The implications of a wrong decision include: users disclosing sensitive information to an authorized source; users giving outside parties the credentials to access corporate systems (and the data they contain); malware infiltrating a corporate network, which could lead to data exfiltration; or ransomware infecting local and networked devices, rendering data inaccessible and, sometimes, unrecoverable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As technology continues to evolve and security threats continue to increase, it has become more important than ever for organizations to arm users with the skills and knowledge they need to identify and avoid dangerous emails and text messages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For infosec professionals, best practices related to phishing prevention and ransomware avoidance may seem like old news; the same can't be said for the average end user, for whom cybersecurity risks are likely to seem foreign (or be mistakenly classified as someone else's - i.e., IT's - problem). Rather than once- or twice-a-year initiatives, it's ongoing awareness and training programs that offer the best opportunity to move the dial on end-user risk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Employees need to be given the opportunity to develop and practice skills over time. Now more than ever, the need for cybersecurity education that makes data protection a daily pursuit has become abundantly clear and difficult to dispute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Effect: Financial Ramifications and Other Business Impacts</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the security of an organization and its data, the foundation must be laid with a combination of company standards and system controls that mandate acceptable behavior. These standards should outline appropriate end-user behaviors and how to address a security concern properly when one arises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The end user is the last line of defense when it comes to compliance. They have a direct impact on an organization's data visibility and must comply with data governance strategies in place to meet regulation requirements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is an organization's responsibility to provide end users with the proper tools for success as the average employee is likely to have only one goal in mind: to get their job done. If end users do not have the proper tools and guidance they need to securely accomplish their goals, they may feel compelled to improvise and seek out workarounds that could put their organization and its data at risk. An example of this improvisation could include the downloading of free consumer-grade applications that share data over unsecure paths.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While there are varying levels of data classification, it is important to identify the level at which each dataset must be protected based on its security level. Restricting access to certain data based on who truly needs access to it and monitoring how these controls are set is critical for all aspects of data management and protection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As security mandates tighten their grip on global organizations in all industries, it becomes more imperative for businesses to be proactive in protecting their critical information. Now more than ever, there are serious implications for having an untrained end user sitting behind a computer screen, in addition to granting numerous end users access to data that should be heavily guarded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With many companies and infosec teams working to understand the implications of the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) - which goes into effect on May 25, 2018 - data protection and data privacy has become an even higher-stakes game for many organizations. In developing a top-level data governance strategy aimed at meeting regulation requirements, it is vital to focus on both the personnel and the tools available.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A successful data governance strategy requires IT leaders to assemble the right teams and resources initially, then be willing to enforce the guidelines set forth across the organization to ensure data protection and avoid costly fines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a recent report,The True Cost of Compliance with Data Protection Regulations, conducted byGlobalscapeandPonemon, data protection non-compliance expenses rose 45 percent from 2011 to 2017, costing organizations with poor data protection plans an average of $14.82 million annually in non-compliance costs (which, incidentally, is 2.71 times the cost of compliance itself).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The costs associated with non-compliance can be reflected in things such as business disruption, productivity loss, revenue loss and significant fines, penalties, and settlements. These costs extend to all compliance regulations, including HIPPA, PCI DSS, and other state privacy and data protection laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Data protection regulations are increasingly complex in nature, due to the increased value and sensitivity of personal and proprietary data. As data becomes more valuable, the risk of data breaches, data loss, cyberattacks, and insider threats becomes a grave and urgent issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pending enforcement of regulations like GDPR demonstrate the new era of complex policies developed to protect data (down to an individual level) from increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks. More data protection regulations and frameworks like the EU's GDPR are expected to be developed and implemented from other areas of the world, including China and Australia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Looking ahead: How to Break the Cycle</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some organizations may think that the implications of non-compliance do not apply to them, be it because of their industry or their geolocation. But there are also clear business implications outside of regulatory requirements (which, frankly, are sure to impact every organization at some point in the near or distant future). Even if a breach doesn't yet carry a fine, a victimized organization is likely to bear the burden of loss of trade secrets, downtime for operations and/or employees, and damage to their reputation (just to name a few). For organizations that also face penalties of non-compliance, it's a &quot;salt in the wound&quot; compounding pain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This Data Privacy Day, we encourage you to learn about your end users' understanding of threats such as phishing and ransomware, and identify areas of susceptibility in your data governance plan. We also urge you to elevate the cybersecurity discussion and make it an end-to-end pursuit for all members of your organization. Employees need to know about your compliance strategy, but they also need to know how to apply best practice for data protection. Equip your end users with the tools and guidance they need to do their job in a way that meets compliance standards and/or protects your organization from suffering a data breach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No matter how deep your organization's pockets might be - and even if you're not required to comply with GDPR or other current or upcoming mandates - you simply cannot afford to ignore the importance of data privacy and the role of end users in ensuring data is adequately protected.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Click for image</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A company's mobile privacy policy is becoming a really big deal. We already knew that privacy policies are a nice piece of low-hanging fruit for Federal Trade Commission (FTC) investigators to examine, to see whether a company is living up to its own promises - as Snapchat learned the hard way. And the European Union's GDPR requirements - which will kick into effect globally in May - also focus on privacy policies, since they are typically a GDPR regulator's first stop. You remember GDPR? That's the one that can fine your company as much as 4% of annual revenue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now comes yet another reason to respect the heck out of your privacy policy: The U.S. Supreme Court is considering making it a determining factor for whether your customers have an expectation of privacy. In short, what you must protect and/or turn over to law enforcement or a shareholder pushing a lawsuit could well be partly determined by how you phrase things in your privacy policy. (I'll pause while you look up your current version and freak out.)</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Supreme Court matter cropped up on Nov. 29 during oral arguments before the full court. The case,&nbsp;Carpenter v. U.S., involved law enforcement tracking - without a search warrant - 127 days' worth of mobile phone location information of a U.S. citizen accused in a series of armed robberies of RadioShack and T-Mobile stores in Michigan and Ohio. Just for the irony of it, the only items stolen were mobile phones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This column has looked at this case before, but the oral arguments shed a lot of light on the thinking of the Court's current justices. Some of the questions from Justice Samuel Alito explored whether mobile phone geolocation details should be considered more sensitive - more worthy of constitutionally derived privacy protections - than other kinds of information that today also do not require search warrants, such as bank data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Why is it more sensitive? Why is cell site location information more sensitive than bank records, which, particularly today, when a lot of people don't use cash much, if at all, a bank record will disclose purchases?&quot; Alito asked defense attorney Nathan Wessler. &quot;It will not only disclose everything that the person buys, it will not only disclose locations, but it will disclose things that can be very sensitive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Replied Wessler: &quot;I absolutely agree, Justice Alito, that the information in bank records can be quite sensitive, but what it cannot do is chart a minute-by-minute account of a person's locations and movements and associations over a long period regardless of what the person is doing at any given moment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That prompted Justice Anthony Kennedy to ask again why phone records are more sensitive than financial records. &quot;Particularly because the information in the bank records that Justice Alito referred to are not publicly known. Your whereabouts are publicly known. People can see you. Surveillance officers can follow you. It seems to me that [phone location records are] much less private than&quot; bank records, Kennedy said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wessler countered: &quot;When a person is engaged in a financial transaction, passing a check, a negotiable instrument, that's an interpersonal transaction where a person has full knowledge that they are putting something into the stream of commerce to transfer funds directed at their bank. Although we may, when we step outside, have a reasonable expectation that someone may see where we go in a short period, nobody has expected in a free society that our longer-term locations will be aggregated and tracked in the way that they can be here,&quot; with phone geolocation data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justice Sonia Sotomayor later asked about the long-term privacy implications of mobile device tracking. &quot;Because right now we're only talking about the cell sites records, but as I understand it, a cell phone can be pinged in your bedroom. It can be pinged at your doctor's office. It can ping you in the most intimate details of your life. Presumably at some point even in a dressing room as you're undressing,&quot; Sotomayor said. &quot;So I am not beyond the belief that someday a provider could turn on my cell phone and listen to my conversations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And then Alito brought up a point that should awaken privacy officers everywhere. In discussing a citizen's expectations of privacy, he wondered how much weight to give what companies directly tell their customers. &quot;The contract, the standard MetroPCS contract seems to say - and I guess we don't have the actual contract in the record here - does seem to say, to advise the customer that we can disclose this information to the government if we get a court order,&quot; Alito said. &quot;So I don't know whether that will hold up. And even if it were to hold up today, what will happen in the future if people - everybody begins to realize that this is provided? If you have enough police TV shows where this is shown, then everybody will know about it, just like they know about CSI information.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wessler responded by first pointing to a survey &quot;that I think quite strongly shows that a strong majority of Americans do not understand that this information is even accessible to, much less retained by, the service providers. I think I should caution the Court that relying too heavily on those contractual documents in either direction here would, to paraphrase the Court in Smith, threaten to make a crazy quilt of the Fourth Amendment because we may end up hinging constitutional protections on the happenstance of companies' policies. But those contractual documents to a company restate and contractualize the protections of the Telecommunications Act and quite strongly promise people that their information will remain private without consent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let's be clear here who is potentially impacted. Although this specific argument relates to mobile carriers - since they hold the initial geolocation data - the implications extend to any company with mobile geolocation data. That includes payment companies and retailers that use geolocation to authenticate purchasers. For that matter, retailers and related businesses collect geolocation data that has nothing to do with authentication, such as determining in which aisle in a store a customer is standing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And once the door is opened, there's no reason to believe it will be limited to geolocation data. This could open government/law enforcement access - without a warrant - to all manner of mobile data. What if a suspect is known to use a specific retailer or even to read a specific online media outlet? (Computerworld perhaps? Nah, who reads that anymore?) Could those businesses have to release those records to law enforcement without a warrant?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This brings us back to your privacy policy. Whether you do it for FTC reasons, GDPR reasons or mobile data access reasons, your privacy policy can determine a lot about how your company will be treated. If you don't want to have to share sensitive mobile records, stress in plain language that it's your policy that you won't. Publicize that policy every way you can, to do what you can to make it clear that your customers have a right to expect privacy on mobile data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That alone may not prevent you from having to reveal that data, but the justices are making it clear that it's a good first step.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vol. 1</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">No. 1</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Customer data platforms are packaged software that collects customer data from multiple source systems, combines it to create a complete view of customer, and makes the resulting database available to other systems. It's a relatively new category: the term was coined in 2013 but few firms adopted the label until about two years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since then, expansion has come quickly. A report this monthhttps://cdpinstitute.org/DL873-CDP-Update-0118from the CDP Institutewww.cdpinstitute.orgfound more than 50 CDP vendors, double the number from one year earlier. The industry's employee count doubled as well. The increase was the combined result of growth among existing vendors, entry of new vendors, and repositioning of existing products as CDPs.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite this growth, many IT managers are still unfamiliar with CDPs. Most have been purchased by marketing departments and many run as services with little involvement by corporate IT. Even IT departments familiar with CDPs are often content to let marketers take the lead in selecting and managing them. This makes sense: marketing analysis and personalization are the main uses of CDP data. And many marketing departments have spent the past several years building their own marketing technology staff, reducing dependence on corporate IT resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some trends within the CDP industry reinforce the separation of CDPs from the rest of the corporate IT infrastructure. The most prominent trend identified by the latest CDP Institute report was expansion of CDP functions from simply creating the unified customer database to also providing analytic and customer engagement capabilities, such as segmentation, predictive models, and personalized message selection. (Delivery of the personalized messages is still usually handled outside the CDP by systems such as email engines, Web content managers, or mobile apps.) Since these added functions are used only within the marketing department, systems including them more clearly belong under marketing control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But other trends may pull corporate IT more deeply into the CDP picture. These include:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Broader use of customer data</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sales and customer service departments also need a complete customer view to do their jobs as well as possible. Data science, finance, planning and other departments want to include customer data in their own analyses and operational decisions. Company-wide access to customer data becomes even more important as digital transformation projects span departmental boundaries to create a consistent, superior customer experience. Although it's technically possible for non-marketing users to take advantage of a marketing-run CDP, it makes obvious organizational sense for the central IT group to take responsibility for a system that supports departments across the company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regulatory requirements</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fast-approaching May 28 deadline for compliance with the European Unions' General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for handling personal information has concentrated new attention on managing, protecting, and accessing customer data. CDPs can play an important role in meeting GDPR requirements by providing a central connection for all systems that gather or use customer information. But the high stakes and corporate-level responsibility built into GDPR make it likely that companies will want a corporate group to manage these functions. That's likely to be corporate IT, not the marketing department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Better technology</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CDPs are by definition packaged software. That is, they contain preassembled components that deliver a complete set of customer data management functions. This contrasts with traditional data warehouses or data lakes, which corporate IT departments build by assembling or creating such components on their own. The packaged nature of CDPs is one of their greatest strengths: as with any build vs buy decision, it's usually more cost-effective to buy an existing package unless truly unique corporate requirements exist. In most cases today, buying a CDP will be a better choice than running a custom development project. But new data management technologies continue to reduce the cost of key tasks such as incorporating new data sources, connecting customer identities, and letting external systems access the assembled customer data. This could start shifting the balance back towards custom systems built by corporate IT.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether corporate IT buys an existing CDP or builds an in-house alternative, there's an increasing probability that IT will end up responsible for the resulting customer database.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Facebook Inc. (FB) works to build trust in the news and advertisements appearing on its social network, the company said Tuesday that it is acquiring&nbsp;Boston digital identity authentication company Confirm Inc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are excited to welcome the Confirm team to Facebook,&quot; a spokesperson said in a written statement. &quot;Their technology and expertise will support our ongoing efforts to keep our community safe.&quot; Confirm noted https://www.confirm.io|the deal on its web site and stated that it&nbsp;will wind down its ID authentication software as it joins Facebook.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Facebook did not elaborate on the strategy, the company has been making a public effort to root out fake news and dubious political advertising&nbsp;and to emphasize connections between https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10104413015393571|actual friends&nbsp;over business and media postings. In the wake of the Equifax Inc. (EFX) hack last year,&nbsp;companies are on notice to protect personal data.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Confirm raised $4 million from Cava Capital in 2015, according to https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/confirm|Crunchbase. Clients include &quot;a number of Fortune 50 companies&quot; in finance, healthcare, insurance, retail and other sectors, the company disclosed in press release last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Boston company's technology uses machine learning and computer vision technologies to help companies verify identities using a driver's license or other ID without storing data that can be hacked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Confirm platform analyzes fraud prevention details on physical, government-issued ID to perform deep data analysis for all of the information the document contains to verify an individual's identity,&quot; Confirm explained in a December https://www.confirm.io/blog/uber-breach-drivers-licenses-what-consumers-need-to-know|blog post about the hack of Uber Technologies Inc. that compromised drivers license numbers and other data of more than 600,000 drivers. &quot;Relying on a single key attribute, such as a license number, creates a natural attack vector. This information alone is no stronger than a social security number or out-of-wallet question.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former FCC Chairman Thomas Wheeler addressed the protections to personal data when he joined the company's advisory board in May 2017. &quot;Confirm has constructed a solution that gives corporations a powerful way to authenticate identity without storing the kinds of personally identifiable information that are both typical in traditional identity authentication solutions and unfortunately the focus of cyber attacks,&quot; Wheeler said in a https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170504005977/en/FCC-Chairman-Tom-Wheeler-Joins-Confirm-Advisory|statement at the time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook has plenty of reasons to&nbsp;improve&nbsp;authentication and to protect consumers.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protecting consumer data has become a hot-button issue. Senators grilled executives of Equifax and Verizon Communication Inc.'s Yahoo! over their security breaches in November, and it is not difficult to imagine Federal legislation akin to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act to protect personal information. The stakes are going to be raised in Europe in May, when the European Union's&nbsp; General Data Protection Regulation takes effect. The GDPR will fine companies that do not adequately protect data &amp;#8364;20 million or 4% of their global annual turnover--whichever is greater.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook itself drew criticism for Russian interference in the&nbsp;2016 elections via its social network. The company may feel some heat&nbsp;to improve its ability to authenticate news sources and advertisers with the mid-term elections looming.&nbsp;&quot;The 2016 US presidential election brought to the fore the risks of foreign meddling, 'fake news' and political polarization,&quot;&nbsp;Facebook Product Manager for politics and elections&nbsp;Samidh Chakrabarti said in a Monday https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/01/effect-social-media-democracy/?frame-nonce=bd5e374778|blog post. &quot;The effect of social media on politics has never been so crucial to examine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg pledged to improve the integrity of content on the site, in a September https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10104052907253171|post on the social network. &quot;We are increasing our investment in security and specifically election integrity,&quot; Zuckerberg wrote. &quot;In the next year, we will more than double the team working on election integrity. In total, we'll add more than 250 people across all our teams focused on security and safety for our community.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moelis &amp; Co. bankers Lawrence Chu, Lee Counselman, Robert Bicknese, Robert McMaster, Adam Rathgaber and Ankush Gupta advised Confirm, which recieved counsel from Goodwin Procter lawyers John Egan, Ian Engstrand and Robert Dzialo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hogan Lovells lawyers Jane Ross, Gabriel Shapiro, Daniel Isaacs, Brian Fleming and William Lamb advised Facebook, which did not retain a banker. Members of the Hogan Lovells team-then at Weil, Gotshal &amp; Manges LLP-advised Facebook on the $19 billion purchase of WhatsApp Inc. in 2014.</SPAN></P>

We can only hope that this year will feel a bit more secure in our digital world, or at the very least avoid even more impressive catastrophes.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the growth of security and technology today, we should be seeing fewer cyberattacks-not more. To avoid becoming this year's disheartening statistic, organizations need to be more proactive about identifying and preventing cyber threats and heed the following predictions:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More (IoT) Data, More Leaks</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the use of IoT devices increases both by consumers and across industries, people and organizations are benefitting from the additional features and increased data gathered from these connected devices. The market isgrowing by leaps and bounds, yet a number of IoT interfaces do not have robust security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Botnets like Reaper and Mirai may just be the beginning, and we expect to see an increased number of data breaches in IoT devices this year. With this in mind, organizations should conduct thorough research before purchasing new IoT technologies. If a device has a hidden administrative account with a hard-coded password, or runs an older framework with known vulnerabilities, it may be impossible to correct.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When purchasing such devices, make sure you can upgrade the firmware, or consider devices that automatically update their own firmware. Review your environment on a quarterly basis and keep these devices up-to-date to avoid possible security issues. If a device in your environment is fundamentally flawed, you may need to turn it off to mitigate a serious risk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regulation will prompt action</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regulations such as NIST 800-171 and the upcoming GDPR will prompt companies to examine their overall security strategy and mitigate risks to their private information. Some companies will do this, some will not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Data privacy is more important than ever and ensuring that companies abide by these standards will ultimately strengthen a companies' business. Many U.S organizations will use a standard such as GDPR to incentivize putting a holistic plan in place. While undergoing the compliance process, it's important for organizations to ensure they are enforcing authorization into systems and networks, while protecting content behind firewalls, and having a plan of action for how to respond in the event of a potential breach. These three areas are key: authorization, protection, and response.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Business as usual</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the growth of data breaches impacting major companies in 2017, a number of organizations still do not take security seriously. After all, how many companies go out of business because they mishandle customer data?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We expect to see two or more major breaches in 2018 that impact millions of consumers. To reduce the risk of a breach, organizations should monitor security updates impacting their systems, and teams should hold a monthly review to make sure they are up to date. In addition, expand beyond simple perimeter security by using rights-management software. This actively protects data stored within and leaving the network to add another level of security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A good rights-management solution protects content in transit, at rest, and while in-use. Employing a data-loss protection (DLP) or a cloud access security broker (CASB) to actively monitor network traffic can also add a layer of protection for information leaving your internal network.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cybersecurity Culture</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2018, more companies will adopt &quot;security-first&quot; thinking and begin to develop a more robust cybersecurity culture. A company is much like a castle, and security is the strength of the moat surrounding a castle, protecting the king, queen, and other residents from invaders. Except in this case, instead of people you have Personal Identifiable Information (PII), proprietary files, intellectual capital, medical information, legal documents, and other information that should only be seen and shared with those people and organizations who have received authorization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adopting security-first thinking means strengthening the moat as the primary line of defense for the castle and its inhabitants.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On November 21, the CSA released theCode of Conduct for GDPR Compliance. This new document is part of CSA's continuous effort tosupport the community with best practicesthat will help cloud providers and customers alike face the tremendous challenge of General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) compliance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our code has been officially submitted to the attention of the Information Commissioner's Office, the UK Data Protection Authority, for its review, as well as to all the other European Data Protection Authorities (DPAs). We are confident that we'll receive positive feedback that will allow CSA to proceed with the final submission to the Article 29 Working Party (WP29) and European Commission for their endorsement.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GDPR, as many have already commented, represents a substantial change in the privacy and security landscape. It will affect every business sector, and cloud computing won't be exempt. GDPR imposes on companies doing business in Europe a set of new obligations, but perhaps most importantly it demands a change in attitude vis-a-vis the way organizations handle personal data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GDPR requests that companies take a new approach to privacy and security and be good stewards of the data that is entrusted to them. Further, they are being asked to demonstrate accountability and transparency. In theory, this shouldn't be a big shock to anyone since the principles of accountability, responsibility and transparency are meant to be the basic foundations of any company's corporate code of ethics. Unfortunately, we have realized that not all of the companies out there have been applying these principles of common sense in a consistent manner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But perhaps the biggest change that GDPR is imposing is related to the stricter approach to the enforcement of the rules that regulators have taken. The fines that will be imposed for non-compliance definitely reflect a punitive logic. Fines will be substantial and are meant to be a deterrent to those organizations looking for short cuts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In such a context, we are all noticing a crazy rush to GDPR compliance, with countdowns all over the internet reminding us how quickly the May 25 deadline is approaching.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So just in case you weren't confused enough on how to tackle GDPR compliance, you can be even more stressed about it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A cultural change doesn't happen overnight though. The radically new attitude requested by GDPR and the related updates to policies and procedures can't possibly be defined, tested and implemented in one day. Those familiar with the management of corporate governance are well aware of how lengthy and expensive the process of changing the internal rules and approaches can be. Rome wasn't built in a day, and likewise this privacy revolution won't magically happen one minute past midnight on May 25.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My bet is that given the magnitude of the effort requested by GDPR compliance, both in terms of cultural change and money, it is unlikely that all of the organizations, especially small- and medium-sized companies and public administrations, will be able to meet the May deadline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is because beside the objective difficulty of the task there are still some provisions and requirements to be clarified, for instance, the Data Breach Notification (the WP29 is working on it). Moreover, there are some known and some hidden problems. For example, the tension between data back up and data deletion that will manifest itself when the new rules are put into practice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To complicate matters further, in the period leading up to May 25, companies will still need to do business and sign contracts that in the majority of cases aren't GDPR-ready, and it is likely that a supplemental effort will be requested for a retrofitting compliance exercise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It will take time to achieve 100-percent compliance and in some cases, even that won't be entirely possible.None of above is an excuse for not working hard to achieve compliance, but rather to say that it will take time to achieve 100-percent compliance and in some cases, even that won't be entirely possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What to do? I'd personally look at the GDPR compliance project as a journey that has already started and won't finish in May. I'd focus on defining the policies and procedures for GDPR compliance, and I'd start implementing them. I'd base my new approach, as much as possible, on standards and best practices. That typically provides me with a good direction. Perhaps standards won't be the ideal route for me, but that's not important since to find the ideal route some correction to the general trajectory is always required.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Standards will assure me that the approach I'm using and the policy I'm defining are likely to be understood by my business partners. Policy interoperability between the cloud service provider and the customer is a fundamental requirement for a sound cloud governance approach, and it will be a key requirement for a successful GDPR compliance journey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, adoption of standards, policy interoperability, and what else? Well, transparency of course.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'd aim for transparency within my organization, and I'd seek out transparency in my business partners. If I want to be a proper steward of data, if I want to make proper risk decisions, if I need to implement accountability, then I need to rely on data, evidence, and facts, which means that I need to work with partners that are willing to collaborate with me and be transparent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And what if I won't be 100-percent ready by May? I'd make sure I'm documenting all the actions taken in order to build and implement my GDPR compliance framework. This will help me provide evidence of my strategy, my good faith, my direction, and my final goal for the regulators. After all, the law is not demanding perfect privacy and security, it's asking for a risk-based approach to privacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I recommend that everyone reading this post seriously consider the adoption of the CSA Code of Conduct for GDPR compliance in association with ourCloud Control Matrix(or any equivalent information security best practice). Those are the free standards we offer the community members for supporting their GDPR compliance journey.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1408  words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Gemalto and Ponemon Institute Study: Significant differences between countries in attitudes to cloud data protection A study reveals regional disparities in the adoption of cloud security: German companies are almost twice as likely to provide security to confidential or sensitive information in the cloud (61%) compared to British (35%), Brazilian (34%) and Japanese (31%) Half of global organizations believe that payment information (54%) and customer data (49%) are at risk in the cloudMore than half (57%) think that using the cloud increases the risk of compliance </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Amsterdam, January 16, 2018 - Gemalto, the world leader in digital security, can reveal today that, while the vast majority of global companies (95%) have adopted cloud services [1], there is a large gap in the level of security precautions applied by companies in different markets. The organizations admitted that, on average, only two fifths (40%) of the data stored in the cloud are protected with encryption and key management solutions. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The findings - as part of the study commissioned by Gemalto from the Ponemon Institute, the &quot;2018 Global Cloud Data Security Study&quot; - revealed that organizations in the United Kingdom (35%), Brazil (34%) and Japan (31%) are less cautious than the German ones (61%) when sharing sensitive and confidential information stored in the cloud with third parties. The study surveyed more than 3,200 IT and IT security professionals from around the world to gain a better understanding of key trends in data governance and security practices for cloud-based services. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Germany's leadership in cloud security extends to its application of controls such as encryption and tokenization. The majority (61%) of the German organizations revealed that they protect sensitive or confidential information while it is stored in the cloud environment, ahead of the US. UU (51%) and Japan (50%). The level or security that is applied increases even more when the company sends or receives data, which reaches 67% for Germany, followed by Japan (62%) and India (61%). %) with the following higher levels. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, more than three quarters (77%) of organizations around the world recognize the importance of having the ability to implement cryptology solutions, such as encryption. This figure will continue to rise, and nine out of ten (91%) believe that this capacity will be more important in the next two years - an increase of 86% over last year. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Manage privacy and regulation in the cloud </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite the increasing adoption of cloud computing and the benefits it offers, it seems that global organizations are still cautious. It is worrying that half consider that payment information (54%) and customer data (49%) are at risk when stored in the cloud. More than half (57%) of global organizations also believe that the use of the cloud makes them more likely to violate privacy and data protection regulations, slightly below 62% in 2016. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Due to this perceived risk, almost all (88%) believe that the new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) will require changes in the governance of the cloud, with two out of five (37%) indicating that would require significant changes. In addition to the difficulty of complying with regulatory requirements, three quarters of respondents (75%) also reported that it is more complex to manage privacy and data protection regulations in a cloud environment than in local networks;France (97%) and the USA. (87%) consider it the most complex, followed closely by India (83%). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With the head in the cloud </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although the use of the cloud is what prevails, the study revealed that there is a gap in consciousness within companies about the services that are used. Only a quarter (25%) of IT and IT security professionals revealed that they are confident that they know all the cloud services used by their company, and a third (31%) trust that they know it. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If you look closer, Shadow IT could continue to pose challenges. More than half of the Australian (61%), Brazilian (59%) and British (56%) organizations do not trust that they know all the applications, platforms or infrastructure services in the cloud used by their organization. Confidence is greater elsewhere, with only a quarter in Germany (27%), Japan (27%) and France (25%) expressing a lack of confidence. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fortunately, the vast majority (81%) believe that having the ability to use strong authentication methods to access data and applications in the cloud is essential or very important. Companies in Australia are most anxious to see authentications implemented. 92% agree that it would help ensure that only authorized people can access certain data and applications in the cloud, followed by India (85%) and Japan (84%). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;While it is good to see that some countries, like Germany, take the issue of cloud security seriously, there is a worrisome attitude elsewhere,&quot; said Jason Hart, director of data protection technology at Gemalto. &quot;This can lead to almost half believing that the cloud makes it harder to protect the data, when the opposite happens.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The benefit of the cloud is its convenience, scalability and cost control by offering companies options that they could not access or pay for on their own, especially in terms of security. data is easier, it should never be assumed that the adoption of the cloud means that the information is automatically secure, just look at the recent leaks of Accenture and Uber to see examples of data in the cloud that have been exposed. the data, the appropriate controls, such as encryption and tokenization, must be located at the origin of the data, once implemented, any compliance problem must be solved. &quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Research methodology </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This research was conducted by the Ponemon Institute on behalf of Gemalto with 3285 IT and IT security professionals surveyed in the US. UU (575), the United Kingdom (405), Australia (244), Germany (492), France (293), Japan (424), India (497) and Brazil (355). </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vol. 1</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">No. 1</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The European Union's General Data Protection Regulation will change the way organizations across the globe handle personal information by enforcing strict guidelines on how that information is collected, handled, and processed. With full implementation coming into effect on May 28, 2018, after which infractions will incur hefty fines, GDPR compliance is critical and companies need to respond quickly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Article 25 has posed particularly difficult challenges for organizations when it comes to business agility. Pertaining to &quot;Data Protection by Design and Default,&quot; Article 25 contains several new regulations for the development and management of software to ensure the processing of user data in a secure manner. In short, Article 25 outlines a number of controls that organizations must build into the systems that process any personal data such that full privacy is the default state of these systems.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Companies want to build systems quickly in order to meet their business needs, and they typically rely on privacy impact assessments (PIAs) to satisfy the kinds of requirements outlined in Article 25. Unfortunately, PIAs are constrained by the number of privacy experts on staff, and this imposes limits on scalability. This might not be an issue for small companies, which might have one privacy officer on staff who can handle all of the PIA work without slowing down system development. But for larger companies, this is much harder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Large, enterprise organizations are unlikely to have enough privacy talent to conduct the necessary PIAs and this may create a critical bottleneck. This will inevitably lead these organizations to take a risk-based approach and focus their privacy talent on their most critical systems. Many other systems will wind up without any privacy by design at all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In order to meet stringent and elaborate regulations like GDPR Article 25, companies need to design a scalable process that doesn't hinge on the expertise of a small number of experts to serve each application. One solution is to adopt a &quot;two-tier&quot; support model.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the first tier, organizations compile a general knowledge base of &quot;privacy by design&quot; controls with actionable advice targeted at system developers and operators-recommendations like, &quot;Ask for consent before setting a cookie.&quot; In order to be meaningful, end users should be able to filter the knowledge base to look only at content that is applicable to their current project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Additionally, the content from the knowledge base should plug directly into development team backlogs so that they be tracked and audited. This both maintains speed and provides proof that data protection was baked into design. Finally, each privacy control should also have verification instructions, so users can validate whether or not the control has been met.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the second tier are the less common controls not contained within the knowledge base and/or the organization's most critical systems. Privacy experts can focus on these, concentrating their efforts on more complex tasks that more worthy of their attention and time. Then, should any of these controls become more common, they can add them to the knowledge base in tier one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the lowest tech end of the spectrum, companies can create the knowledge base for tier-one in an Excel sheet with customized filters. However, this is an inefficient, overly tedious, undependable solution for large organizations, especially with GDPR raising the consequences of error.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A more robust and scalable solution is to embrace an Application Security Requirements and Threat Management (ASRTM) methodology. GartnerdefinesASRTM as being &quot;used for automating security requirements definition, risk assessment and threat modeling, often with Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) integration.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ASRTM takes the two-tier approach described above and automate its critical functions while integrating smoothly into an organization's development processes. The content for the control knowledge base can be supplied by your application security vendor and/or built and customized in-house by an organization's privacy experts. ASRTM best practices calls for ALM tool integration, providing developers with immediate, easy-to-deploy instructions for building security into applications. It also offers an auditable trail to prove GDPR compliance. The result is compliance with GDPR's stringent privacy standards without sacrificing business-wide agility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ASRTM has uses well beyond GDPR and data privacy. The exact same process and steps outlined above are also applicable to numerous other compliance standards and initiatives, as well as general cybersecurity best practices. Having a single set of tooling for privacy, compliance, application, and network security needs reduces the process overhead for developers. This allows developers to focus on building software, and speeds up the pace of a whole organization without sacrificing security.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Payment companies need to act now to make sure their data is protected, to thwart and expanding crime threat and to stay compliant with regulations in most markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GDPR is one major regulation on the horizon. In May, the European Commission will introduce an entirely new set of standardized laws designed to unify data protection across the European Union, and they will also apply to any business that operates within those confines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Due to the significant financial penalties that will be imposed in the event of a breach, noncompliance will not be an option for the vast majority of businesses. Ensuring you are ready for May 2018 must be a priority - not least because this legislation marks the beginning of much further reaching conversations about the introduction of a global privacy standard built with GDPR as its benchmark. It's now a matter of when, not if.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PCI CDE will be under increasing threat of attack. The cardholder data environment (CDE) is a prime target for hackers and would-be thieves - in the retail sector almost all of the data breaches involve some kind of compromise occurring in the CDE. As with all threats, this is a trend we only expect to increase, however the rising threat can be mitigated with the introduction of controls required to secure the CDE by PCI DSS. Businesses may not be able to reduce the number of incoming threats but, by ensuring PCI DSS compliance, they can certainly reduce the success rate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite investment in security and compliance, there are no signs that high-profile hacks are slowing down. In fact, the likelihood is increasing at pace, according to data release by Verizon in 2017. The company noted a 50% increase in attacks year on year, and with even global brand names falling victim in 2017, no business that values its reputation should be taking their eye off the security ball.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And, while 2017 was heralded as the year of ransomware with high-profile attacks such as WannaCry grabbing headlines and causing chaos, 2018 looks set to continue the trend. The particularly bad news is that an increase in ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) will open up the potential for even non-technical hackers to target poorly secured organizations and consumers. Businesses now more than ever will need to step up their protections if they don't want to fall foul of the bad guys.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To date, the vast majority of security investment has focused firmly on keeping the bad guys out. It only ever works to a certain extent. This is because there is much greater impetus for the hackers to devise new methodologies to gain access and the security industry at large is only ever playing catch-up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We expect 2018 to see a step change in the mentality of data protection from trying to keep people out, to simply ensuring there is no data for them to take if (and let's face it, when) they get in. if businesses can remove the valuable data from their environments it no longer matters if and when there is a breach. De-scoping PCI data will increasingly become the method of choice for businesses augmenting their intrusion prevention positions next year. Who needs locks anyway?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And finally, if businesses needed another reason to de-scope, July 2018 will see another raft of standard changes being introduced. Each of which will require new changes being made to the environment. The simpler route may well be to de-scope the business altogether from PCI, ensuring compliance and reducing the threat from would-be hackers in one step.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For any organization that does business in the European Union (EU) in any capacity, it's no secret that theGeneral Data Protection Regulationis a crucial piece of legislation. Every company that has offices, customers or partners based in the European Union will be affected, and come May 25, 2018, the way we are working with their data will be under strict new guidelines, impacting the way we do business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It won't take long after the deadline before the gloves come off and the EU cracks down on audits of big tech companies. We're talking about Uber, Google, Apple and so forth. This will be EU's effort to reinforce the severity of meeting GDPR regulations and to show that no business - not even the household names - will be immune to complying with GDPR stands.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the EU cracks down on the big tech companies, financial institutions and travel companies will be next, as these types of organizations are the most globalized industries, where data flows freely across geographical borders. And regardless of the EU's efforts, the reality is that many companies won't meet the May deadline, whether due to lack of resources, laziness or apathy. You better believe that those businesses that don't get on board - and get caught - will be crushed, as business will come to a grinding halt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you are behind -- or gasp! -- aren't taking action to prepare for GDPR right now, you may be straggling, but you're not too late. The process may be a beast, but it's absolutely manageable if you're organized. Here are four tips to begin your GDPR journey:</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><UL CLASS="c9"><LI CLASS="c10"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"><NOBR>&bull;</NOBR></SPAN></P>
<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Establish a privacy program. This is the first place you should start. If you do this upfront, then when new regulations come out, you have a set baseline of where you are at and can more efficiently fill in the gaps. There will always be new regulations your organization must embrace, so get ahead of the curve while you can. The privacy program must address data flow, data classification, critical systems and encryption.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
</LI><LI CLASS="c10"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"><NOBR>&bull;</NOBR></SPAN></P>
<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hire a Data Privacy Officer. Designating a person to lead the charge on providing the company with best practices on how to approach data privacy is critical. This role helps employees understand where the organization's data resides and how best to protect it with methods like encryption. Additionally, make sure this person actually has proper certifications by May 2018, and is truly qualified for the position. This role will only continue to increase in importance for companies working in the global market that must remain compliant across borders. Also, make sure you have a privacy attorney either on staff or retainer.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
</LI><LI CLASS="c10"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"><NOBR>&bull;</NOBR></SPAN></P>
<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seek third-party validation for your organization. Any streetwise potential customer or partner will request this while you're working out the fine print of any contract, so you may as well beat them to the punch. This will also allow for you to protect your business in the event of a breach, so that you are not held liable because of accusations you aren't GDPR compliant. You have a couple options for obtaining such validation. You can either conduct a rigorous self-assessment, or seek an external audit firm. Most audit firms are still not trained and properly qualified to run a data protection impact assessment.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
</LI><LI CLASS="c10"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"><NOBR>&bull;</NOBR></SPAN></P>
<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hold your partners and vendors to the same standards. While you continue on your journey to GDPR compliance, make sure you also monitor for progress with any partners or vendors your business works closely with. Tell-tale signs include the aforementioned tips - i.e. do they have a privacy program, a Data Privacy Officer and third-party validation? Another clue they are well equipped to handle GDPR regulations is they are a cardholder data environment (CDE), defined by the PCI Security Standards Council as &quot;the people, processes and technology that store, process or transmit cardholder data or sensitive authentication data.&quot;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most vendors today do not have their entire data flow or infrastructure as a CDE. However, those that do have a distinct advantage as everything is already encrypted and treated as mission critical. In order to confirm this status with a partner or vendor, all you need to do is ask for a Attestation of Compliance for proof, and confirm that they are leveraging data loss prevention software in order to protect their data.Avoid the Pitfalls</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the process of achieving GDPR compliance is a lengthy one, you still have time. In fact, it may be a bold statement for any organization to come forward at this point and claim it is GDPR compliant. Why? Because most third-party auditors are still wrapping their own heads around the process, and haven't quite gotten to the point where they can provide validation for their clients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you do come across a business making this claim, don't take the marketing language at face value. Instead, ask one simple question: &quot;Where is their third-party validation?&quot; Most companies will not be able to answer that simple question. In the meantime, you can get a quick evaluation of a cloud-based company's GDPR readiness from Cloud Access Security Brokers vendors like NetSkope.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Additionally, write off any company that says it is already GDPR compliant because they have another type of certification, such as SOC 2 or HIPAA. While there may be numerous common controls, there are core differences between each that cannot be ignored.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the coming months, diligence will be key when it comes to not only preparing your own organization for GDPR compliance, but also placing the same standards on vendors, partners and others you do business with. Just remember: breathe, take it one step at a time, and whatever you do, don't fall for scare tactics.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cost of non-compliance with government cybersecurity regulations has significantly increased over the past few years, and the issue could grow more serious, according to a recent report by research firm Ponemon Institute and security company GlobalScape Inc.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the report, the companies surveyed 53 multinational organizations located in the U.S., and found that the average cost of compliance increased 43 percent from a similar 2011 survey, and totals around $5.47 million annually. However, the average cost of non-compliance increased 45 percent from 2011, and adds up to $14.82 million annually.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A large majority of organizations (90 percent) think compliance with the upcoming General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) would be difficult to achieve. GDPR is considered by respondents to be the most challenging among data compliance regulations such as Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) and Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Non-compliance costs 2.71 times the cost of maintaining or meeting compliance requirements, the report said. Non-compliance costs come from the costs associated with business disruption, productivity losses, fines, penalties, and settlement costs, among others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cost of compliance varies by industry, with media organizations averaging $7.7 million annually to comply with regulations and policies while financial services companies face more than $30.9 million annually in compliance costs. These costs widely vary based on the amount of sensitive or confidential information a particular industry handles and is required to secure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The findings from both the 2011 and 2017 studies provide strong evidence that it pays to invest in compliance,&quot; said Larry Ponemon, chairman and founder at Ponemon Institute. &quot;With the passage of more data protection regulations that can result in costly penalties and fines, it makes good business sense to allocate resources to such activities as audits and assessments, enabling technologies, training and in-house expertise.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Innovation is key to future-proofing your solutions, and research shows that thepublic cloudis the default platform for innovation. Over the course of the coming years, cloud innovation, particularly in security, will lead to major cloud providers offering higher levels of security than even best-in-class on-premise security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Which organizations are adopting the cloud at which rate is highly dependent on market size, region and vertical. According to anISACA white paper, market maturity of cloud is currently in the &quot;Growth Stage,&quot; and that it is particularly attractive for Small to Medium Enterprises (&quot;SME&quot;). The reasoning here is that SMEs can often simply not afford to invest in expensive on-premise applications and are looking to cloud solutions first for applications such as Enterprise Resource Planning or Customer Relationship Management.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cloud computing may even offernew security opportunitiesfor SMEs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, what is actually meant by cloud computing, what deployment models are we talking about, and why? Here, it is assumed the reader has a good understanding of cloud, its deployment models and application areas; otherwise some very good explanationscan be foundfrom the Cloud Security Alliance (CSA).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cloud Services are divided into three categories: Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adoption rates of cloud services are highest for SaaS, which is also the type of service where the security responsibility/capabilitylies primarily with the cloud providers. This article generally applies to all three types of services, but I'll focus for the remainder of the article on SaaS services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let us assume you are considering or even already are procuring cloud services. What needs to be taken into account? How do you know which provider to choose? Are there any established methodologies that can be leveraged?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As with any procurement process, getting a solid list of business requirements is the best first step. If you do not have time or resources to do this, there are also very good generic guidelines available from CSA, theConsensus Assessments Initial Questionnaire, which can be leveraged to compare cloud providers' offerings and includes governance and compliance topics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Be sure to take into account local regulations on personal data (e.g. GDPR) or industry-specific compliance requirements (e.g. PCI or HIPAA).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Larger cloud providers may have already invested heavily in these topics for their customer base. Imagine having different SaaS providers for every application, e.g. Provider 1 for Customer Experience, Provider 2 for Recruiting, Provider 3 for Enterprise Resource Planning, etc. That leads to &quot;cloud sprawl,&quot; and can significantly complicate both security and compliance processes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When choosing a cloud provider, consider avoiding &quot;cloud sprawl.&quot; It is possible to select a cloud provider that provides multiple offerings, thereby avoiding such sprawl. How does the cloud provider ensure seamless, efficient and secure operations? What measures have been taken to guarantee business continuity and disaster recovery? Are these measures complemented with solid incident response and transparent disclosure policies?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maintaining data confidentiality through encryption and key management may very well be more efficient for a cloud provider to implement; ask how these security features are realized. Last, but definitely not least, be sure you do not get ensnared with &quot;vendor lock-in.&quot; Ask about termination policies - according to Forrester, market consolidation of SaaS providers may make termination necessary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once a SaaS provider is chosen, some gaps may still remain, depending on the identified business requirements. In the security space, the following add-ons should be considered:</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With only five months until the General Data Protection Regulation goes into effect, time is ticking for businesses to get their email security and archive solutions ready.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By May 2018, any organization handling E.U. resident information will be responsible for maintaining compliance within GDPR - and email is often an overlooked component. More than 90 percent of cyberattacks start with email - whether it's from customers, partners or colleagues, organizations collect hundreds, if not thousands, of emails that contain personal information every day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Considering the current cybersecurity landscape, none of that data is safe - even your deleted files. And all of it is vulnerable to attack, which ups the risk for getting hit with noncompliance penalties.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, how can your business ward off hefty fines and ensure compliance in 2018? For starters, make archiving an essential part of your compliance plans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Make archiving an essential part of your compliance plans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When GDPR goes into effect, organizations will need quick and easy access to their email - both current and historical files. This includes trashed and archived emails, which aren't always simple to find.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the archiving solutions of yesterday are outdated; they're difficult to use and extremely time-consuming. For most businesses, email first-pass review isn't going to cut it. RecentVanson Bourne global researchfound that 56 percent of respondents are plagued by slow search performance, with 50 percent claiming archive searches can take up to five minutes. Of that, twenty percent say it can take as long as 10 minutes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While first-pass review is an important part of the eDiscovery process, there are strict deadlines and more priority tasks to be tended to, meaning the amount of time an admin can spend reviewing and searching is tight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fortunately, architecting a security, privacy, and governance solution for email can be fast and simple. Use the following checklist to ensure your archiving solutions are in top notch shape before GDPR is here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Consider the chains of custody.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Audit trails, referred to as &quot;chains of custody&quot; by some, are an essential piece of the puzzle when it comes to rounding out your archiving solution. It's important to know who owns, moves and accesses archived data to quickly recall specific files. Be sure to keep track of the five Ws (who, what, where, when and why), so you can easily identify the location and contents of potentially private or personally identifiable information in a jiff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Determine who holds the keys to the castle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a time crunch and can't access the files you need to? Archiving solutions should make it simple for users to approve (and disapprove) who has the ability to directly access and recall specific files. In today's mobile world, being able to securely recall those files via email, the web or mobile without breaking a sweat can decrease search times, improving overall search capabilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Leap to the cloud.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Has your team moved to a cloud-based solution yet? If the answer's no, you're not alone, but you may soon be. Cloud adoption is up - and archiving is becoming a popular use case. Today, utilizing the cloud for archiving solutions saves the budget and your employees time. And in the future, unified access to a cloud-based archive will pay benefits in business intelligence and analytics. So, say goodbye to the days of updating outdated hardware and increasing storage capacities, while still keeping that data protected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Make teamwork a priority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Think the IT team is responsible for archiving? Think again. Everyone in the organization, from the C-level down, should be involved in the process. Teams must work together to define each of the different files that are being archived, and determine their sensitivity and retention period to develop the best protection plan. Without this collaboration, there's a good chance files will go &quot;missing.&quot; And getting them back will require extensive resources - time and money - to recover.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the GDPR deadline looms closer, use this checklist as a basis to ensure your organization is prepared. After all, you don't want to be hit with any compliance fines. And your bosses, finance team, colleagues, business partners and customers will thank you.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2017, the big data market came of age. The market grew at an accelerated pace thanks to an increasing number of organizations that understand data is their most important business asset. These savvy companies established teams and employed tools to optimize data's operational and competitive value. And there's no end in sight to the focus on data: IDC forecast the U.S. market for big data and business analytics solutions will reach more than $95 billion by 2020.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As data takes center stage, one of the key takeaways is that it's no longer enough to stockpile massive amounts of data and cross your fingers that users will find what they need to do their job.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year, organizations will need to address the usability of data to ensure that users can find, understand and trust the data. This will involve protecting the rights of &quot;data citizens&quot; (all users in an organization who use data), increasing regulations to manage risk, and taking advantage of more self-service business intelligence (BI) tools.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here are four predictions for data in 2018:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">#1 - Data Protection Will Get Personal</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consumers are becoming increasingly aware of the amount of data businesses collect and store about them, especially in light of the proliferation of high-profile data breaches in 2017. They're rightly asking questions about how organizations use, protect, and secure their personal information. Data protection will undoubtedly be on everyone's radar during the coming year, particularly as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) goes into effect in May. Organizations will need to demonstrate not only that they are protecting the data, but also that they are using the data for good.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">#2 - AI Will Expose Organizational Deficiencies</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the past year, organizations of all sizes began investing in AI. But despite the many benefits AI promises to deliver, many businesses have discovered that AI doesn't come without challenges. In 2018, AI will expose data deficiencies and reveal where data processes fall apart as organizations struggle to answer simple question, such as:</SPAN></P>

<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How do I embed the outputs from AI into day-to-day business operations?&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As AI begins to take hold, it will be important for organizations to build governance into their projects from the get-go. A solid governance foundation means AI analysts can find the data they need, know what it means, how it can be used, and gain transparency into its quality and ownership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Data Catalogs Will Become the Biggest Data Craze</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Data catalogs will be the talk of the town in 2018 as more organizations finally take note of their business users' desire for a more &quot;consumerized&quot; approach to access the data. Be aware, though, that not all data catalogs are created equal. Some catalogs are nothing more than a big list of data elements. With some research, it's possible to find a data catalog that connects the list of data elements to meaningful information in an established business glossary. This will enable business users to find data and trust that data to drive business decisions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Data Management and BI Tools Will Become Commodities</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Data management and BI tools have been around for years. But in 2018, data management and BI tools will become commodities and more vendors will build these tools and offer them in the cloud or via open source. This shift will show that self-service tools and the reports they generate are here to stay, but having proper data governance integrated with these tools is a necessity to ensure that the analysis is accurate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The data world is changing, and organizations would be wise to keep pace with the latest developments and trends. Data can lead to insight. It can help organziations answer their most critical business questions. Organziations that wish to unlock the hidden value of their data can begin by instituting a data governance framework that will make data easy to find, understand and easy to trust - supporting these and other emerging data trends.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Long gone are the days of the small cyberattacks carried out by college kids in their garages. Today, organized criminals and professional hackers are developing frequent, debilitating attacks targeted at companies. Businesses now need to accept that a cyberattack is not an &quot;if,&quot; it's a &quot;when.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the right preparation, organizations can reduce the risk of cyberattacks to a tolerable level with lower exposure. But how? This first step is understanding what vulnerabilities your company faces, including the data and technology you might not even realize is vulnerable.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So where are vulnerabilities hiding?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Critical Business Data</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the world of organized crime and international business, destabilizing businesses and conducting espionage can often be a business in and of itself. These attacks are typically targeted at sensitive information, often with the goal of gaining unauthorized access to intellectual property for purposes of selling to competitors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From financial statements to emails, the insider threat risks of leaked critical business data can be catastrophic. Take the risks associated with M&amp;A deals, for example. If information is leaked on a potential asking price, or even information on competitors' existing bids, that could be hugely detrimental to all parties involved. Not only is the confidential information now out in the public, but also it presents the opportunity for competitors to gain further knowledge on the market landscape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Personal Data</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Phishing emails are virtually undetectable now, arriving in inboxes with proper formatting and very carefully crafted and grammatically correct English. From email addresses to social security numbers, the data derived from these types of attacks can be debilitating to retail consumers if not recovered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most recently, popular video streaming serviceNetflixwas hit with an almost undetectable phishing scam. Demands for account information often top the list of email requests from hackers, as many Netflix users unknowingly provide personal details to a third party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What are some common traits of a phishing email or scam? Beware of unknown senders or those that look familiar but are relaying urgency. Verify by hovering over the sender's name to reveal the true email address. Remember the golden rule of security - always think and verify before you act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IoT Device Data</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Internet of Things (IoT) devices, such as internet cameras and programmable thermostats, can serve as an easy gateway into an organization's back-end systems, enabling attackers to ultimately harvest and even alter data in other systems at will.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the latest IoT botnets has been dubbedReaper. This botnet similar to Mirai, but with one twist. Reaper guesses the passwords of IoT devices; it also uses known security flaws to insert and spread itself within devices. As Reaper has already affected over a million networks, who's to say that the next IoT device won't be a part of a major organization?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To protect IoT data, avoid using IoT devices that are not regularly updated to ensure protection against connected device attacks, and beware of non-credible vendors that aren't trustworthy. Use IoT that has been built and deployed with security in mind, and is security-certified by reputable parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biometric Data</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With businesses heightening physical security measures, biometric data only becomes more profitable to hackers. The price of fingerprint data cannot be exactly quantified, but when used maliciously, can be extremely detrimental to an organization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One researcherhas already claimed to hack through the iPhone X face scanning technology, and the phone has only been on the market for a few weeks. Hackers are becoming more resourceful, and if they are able to reproduce and alter physical appearances (as well as data), biometric data will be the next to fall victim to the black market. To protect biometric data, ensure that you are only gathering it on secure devices and ensure that it is encrypted when transmitted across networks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regulatory Data</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protection of regulatory information is increasing throughout all industries. With General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requirements less than six months away, all eyes are on global organizations. The effects of GDPR will be felt worldwide, since virtually all organizations are part of a global network. With four percent of a company's annual turnover on the line, companies will start to move quickly to secure data for regulatory purposes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within organizations, reducing personal data to only the minimum required can prevent unnecessary leaks, including the elimination of non-essential stores of personally identifiable information (PII) data. Strong data encryption, coupled with following GDPR requirements, can help to improve and strengthen your data handling governance and processes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Risk Assessment is Key</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An attack will happen, but the severity will be determined by preparation. An initial risk assessment is necessary to understand what data you have access to and what may potentially be vulnerable. In many cases, you may have access to sensitive data that you no longer need in your system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taking holistic measures for cybersecurity will allow businesses of all sizes to better prepare for the inevitable. Building a program that makes sense for your business can protect your assets in a comprehensive way without over extending your team. There is no airbag guarantee; however, evaluating business goals, educating all employees and investing in the proper tools could mitigate the cost of a potential cybersecurity fender bender.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's no question that the hyperconverged infrastructure (HCI) has had a huge impact on simplifying technology deployments. Nutantix solutions, Cisco HyperFlex and HPE Simplivity have been widely adopted and have changed the face of the data center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HCI was initially considered niche to simplify the deployment of virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI), but it has seen increased adoption for other workloads. One use case for HCI that has flown under the radar is secondary storage. Late last year, I profiled Cohesity,&nbsp;the vendor that has been leading the emerging hyperconverged secondary storage market.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cohesity's achievements in the hyperconverged secondary storage market</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week, Cohesity issued a press release touting its momentum and confirming this validating market has arrived. Highlights of their announcement include:</SPAN></P>

<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The market is seeing strong growth. Nothing validates a market like revenue growth. Although Cohesity isn't the only vendor (Rubrik), I believe they are a good proxy for the industry given it's in its infancy. In 2017, Cohesity saw a 600 percent increase in revenue, more than doubling its overall customer count. One of the most encouraging facts about Cohesity's numbers is that they landed a dozen Fortune 500 companies, showing that larger enterprises have become aware of the value. Frankly, every large enterprise should be using something like Cohesity, but internal processes often get in the way of new technology being adopted. Also, about half of Cohesity's customers made repeat purchases in 2017, with many implementations exceeding 1 petabyte. The add-on buying is an indicator that customers are indeed seeing the value of bringing the benefits of HCI to secondary storage. Secondary storage is a huge headache for companies, so I'm not surprised at the results.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cloud is now part of a business's data management strategy. The press release indicated that over half of Cohesity's customers deployed their cloud services. The cloud poses an interesting data management problem for businesses because so many are procured by &quot;shadow IT&quot; or are mandated by a particular vendor. For example, it's possible, even likely, to have a user copy a file from the businesses shared drive, make modifications, and store the data in a cloud drive. Then the user might text a copy and email it, creating a couple more copies. It's the responsibility of the organization to manage all these copies. The upcoming General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) mandates that all copies of data are deleted. It's impossible to see how an IT organization would accomplish this without a comprehensive data management tool, such as Cohesity.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The venture community is seeing the value. Cohesity announced a $90 million Series C funding round co-led by Google Ventures and Sequoia Capital, two of the more notable VCs. Other investors in this round include Cisco Investments and HPE. Given how massive the opportunity is with secondary storage, I would expect to see more VC dollars move into this market.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Channel partners are showing more interest. Historically, storage has been thought of as boring and mature, and most channel partners like to deal with cool, new technology that can have a high service attach rate. Given the continued explosion of data, more channel partners are realizing that helping their customers get a handle on their data is as cool as anything out there. Cohesity announced that it now has over 200 channel partners, but that's just the tip of the spear. HPE is currently reselling a pre-configured, certified version of Cohesity through its channel, and the company is now a member of Cisco's Solution Partner Program, adding thousands of channel partners into the mix.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cohesity is putting on its big boy pants. I've always thought of Cohesity as a startup, but clearly with its global reach and penetration into large enterprises, it's becoming a mainstream vendor. Gartner and Forrester named the company a Cool Vendor and Disruptive Vendor, respectively, in 2017. Now that the company is getting bigger, it needs to start doing big company things. The company recently hired several new executives to lead different parts of the business, including President and COO Rob Salmon, Global Sales Leader Mark Parrinello, Vice President of Engineering Vineet Abraham, Vice Presidient of WorldWide Channels Todd Palmer, and Vice President of EMEA Sales Klaus Seidl.&nbsp; The company also announced its first ever chief marketing officer, Lynn Lucas, who came from Veritas and was at Cisco before that. I've known Lucas for well over a decade, and Cohesity's landing a person with her background is a testament to not only where the company is today but to the potential that the overall market has.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Managing secondary storage is painful</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There may be no bigger pain the neck in all of IT than managing secondary storage. It's like living in a house for too many years where you keep storing more and more things in your basement but have no clue what it's for. A 2016 report from Veritas&nbsp;found that 85 percent of data stored is either dark, redundant, obsolete, or trivial, meaning IT departments are trying to manage data they will likely never use.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By leveraging HCI, Cohesity offers a scalable way to solve the secondary data sprawl problem before it cripples the business. The momentum that the company is seeing is a testament not just to their quality of product but to how big the problem has become for organizations.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mexico, 8 Jan (Notimex) .- In 2018, digital attacks will take a greater presence, so new technologies and trends in cybersecurity will be the focus of attention in the coming months, said Cylance. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a statement, the cybersecurity firm said that this year, more threat actors will adopt simple tools, designed to remove any indication of their attacks. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He pointed out that there will be more &quot;backdoors&quot; that will show fewer features and become more modular, creating smaller system footprints and making attribution more complicated in all areas. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The company said that successful attribution will become more challenging; the door will open for increasingly ambitious cyber attacks and to influence campaigns by states, nations and criminals. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He added that the time will come when security providers will be asked to explain why their products could not fulfill the promises of their marketing departments, which will have a serious impact on security solutions. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The companies currently publicly promote their preparation for the GDPR, but at the same time a certain level of uncertainty is expected about the capacity of each of the companies to comply with these strict guidelines, he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the same way, he explained that social networks were created as an entertaining method to communicate, but they began to follow different influencers and Facebook, Twitter and other platforms were used as means for the consumption of news and information. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Therefore, social networks were deeply linked to the way in which we experience and perceive our democracy, so security in these has become essential, he added. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the year privacy safeguards finally kick in for consumers after outraged lawmakers wasted no time passing legislation in the wake of the Equifax data breach, which exposed the personal information of more than 145 million Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm just kidding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After lots of huffing and puffing for the cameras, Republican lawmakers have blocked all legislation aimed at improving privacy protections or holding companies more accountable for the loss of people's info.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Contrast this with what's happening in Europe, where, all kidding aside, this year really will mark a major milestone as sweeping new privacy rules, known as General Data Protection Regulation, are implemented throughout the European Union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adding insult to injury, U.S. multinationals will spend big bucks complying with the new European rules and watching the backs of EU residents, while their attention to Americans' privacy will be largely unchanged, which is to say they'll make as little effort as legally possible keeping our data under wraps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Are Americans going to be left behind in terms of privacy? You bet,&quot; said Herb Lin, a senior research scholar at Stanford University's Center for International Security and Cooperation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We found out in September that hackers had penetrated Equifax's defenses and gained access to the names, Social Security numbers, birth dates and addresses of tens of millions of people, which the credit agency's then chief executive, Richard Smith, called &quot;a disappointing event for our company.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Equifax was disappointed, consumers were downright mortified, not least because the hacking apparently was discovered by the company in July and it took them more than a month to notify the public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During that month, several senior Equifax executives, including the chief financial officer, sold off nearly $2 million worth of stock. After the breach was revealed, the company's share price plunged more than 33%. Equifax insists the execs didn't know about the hacking when they cashed in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rep. Greg Walden, the Republican chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, promised at an October hearing to hold Equifax accountable for putting people's privacy in jeopardy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's like the guards at Ft. Knox forgot to lock the doors and failed to notice thieves emptying the vaults,&quot; he declared, adding that he expected the company to cooperate with &quot;particular legislation that arises out of this horrific breach.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As it turned out, it was Walden and other Republicans who chose not to cooperate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several bills were introduced by Democratic lawmakers requiring companies to quickly notify customers of a security breach and to provide effective protections, such as no-cost credit freezes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those bills went nowhere as Republicans concentrated instead on cutting taxes for Equifax and other corporations, and amid pushback from industry groups, which rejected the prospect of increased oversight and regulation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Equifaxes of the world are too powerful, and we have a business-friendly Republican Congress,&quot; Lin told me. &quot;They're loath to impose regulations that could impede commerce.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet a free market for people's information is little more than a shopping mall for hackers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There have been nearly 8,000 known data breaches since 2005 involving more than 10 billion records, according to San Diego's Privacy Rights Clearinghouse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's a high price to pay for unimpeded commerce.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now look at Europe and the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which takes effect in May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The basic idea behind the law is that life is different in the digital age and we need rules that reflect the changed circumstances and that can help the little guy stand up to corporate behemoths seeking to profit from people's data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The GDPR is a monumental step forward,&quot; said Bart Huffman, a partner in the Information Technology, Privacy and Data Security Group of the international law firm Reed Smith. He called this &quot;a watershed moment for privacy law.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the more noteworthy elements of the European rules:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Companies must obtain consent from customers before using or sharing their personal information, and this approval must be sought in clear, easily understood language. Companies must make it similarly easy for a customer to withdraw consent, if desired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Customers must be notified of any security breach within 72 hours if the privacy incursion is likely to &quot;result in a risk for the rights and freedoms of individuals,&quot; which is a sufficiently broad definition as to require notice in virtually all instances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Consumers have a right to know how their personal data is being used and to receive a free copy of any such information held by a business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* There is a right to be forgotten -- that is, an individual can require that a business erase his or her data and make no further use of it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps most important, the General Data Protection Regulation has teeth. A violation of the law can result in a fine of up to 20 million euros ($24 million) or 4% of the company's annual global revenue, whichever is greater.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As an example of what's at stake, Apple reported $229 billion in worldwide sales in the fiscal year that ended in September. Four percent of that total is about $9 billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kristen Eichensehr, an assistant professor at UCLA School of Law who specializes in cybersecurity issues, said the Europeans begin any privacy discussion with a presumption that individuals have a right to control their personal information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We don't have a similar right in this country,&quot; she observed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For that reason, Eichensehr said, &quot;it's hard to imagine much of what Europe is doing being implemented in the U.S.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Every expert I spoke with said the same. In the current political climate, there's virtually no chance of enacting privacy protections at the federal level. Instead, it will be up to states to pass whatever pro-consumer rules they can muster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's good news for Equifax.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You're pretty much on your own.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mexico, 2 Jan (Notimex).-'traditional' data and Artificial Intelligence-based, jobs jobs, new entrants to room together and human skills for a technology-driven world, are trends that will impact in 2018, said Hays.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the CEO of Hays, Alistair Cox, companies continue to search for developers of Artificial Intelligence, especially of those that this technology can be applied in a context of consumption.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement, the recruitment company said that candidates with an understanding of the business opportunities will have great demand, together with the developers that can improve an organization and streamline processes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Large amounts of digital information have grown, and the increase in the technology of Internet of things (IoT, its acronym in English) likely to speed it up. However, without the analysis data have no value, which explains why we see a sharp increase in Data Scientist, Data Analyst, Data Artists and Data Visualiser vacancies around the world&quot;, said Cox.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added that these professionals give meaning to the data of a company, help turn zeros and ones on ideas that lead to action, whether changes in the behavior of the client or new opportunities that have not been detected by human eyes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Data drive demand in a number of sector-specific, including jobs in areas such as Performance Marketers, Marketing Automation, Customer Analytics, and CRM Specialists, detailed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also, he said that more traditional functions related and not technology, will be important, &quot;software developers have great demand, organizations evolve their digital offer to meet the changing expectations of the consumer&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The preparation for various industries regulatory changes, as well as a continuous focus on the digital transformation, create large-scale projects that will increase the demand for professionals in project management and changes, in particular Manager jobs project and business analyst.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Executive said that there will be a greater demand for leaders who can ensure the security of the systems of a company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the regulation General protection of data (GDPR) which will be implemented in next may, the regulation provides a great demand for this kind of professionals, mentioned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added that also is expected that the demand for Automation Chief Officers (chaos), &quot;will increase the presence of chaos while the companies recognize the revolutionary potential of AI, but, for now, remain on alert before the unforeseen impact that could&quot; have your business model&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, employers will look for creativity, collaboration, human interpretation and communication skills in the candidates who stand out are those that are not only capable of providing solutions to the challenges, but also communicate how and why to implement them, he said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier tech transformation may appear simple compared to what's around the corner for helping corporate legal innovate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just 10 years ago, while working in e-discovery at an Am Law firm, my team spent multiple days and nights on a second request challenge. We worried about whether we would have enough CD copiers, labelers and time to burn and stamp our 75-disc production. Our solution? A makeshift assembly line, where one team member manned the burners, another ran quality control, a third labeled the discs, a fourth put the discs in cases, and a fifth organized the shipment boxes. We must have billed 300 collective hours for this single request. Yet that task would take maybe 10 minutes of billable time today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This memory is a reminder of how swiftly change comes to the legal technology world. Whether you're a law firm, a corporate legal department or an alternative service provider, the pace and complexity of change that technology brings continues to accelerate. Make 2018 the year to embrace disruption and position yourself ahead of the curve. For in-house legal teams, technology has already transformed the way lawyers mitigate risk, evaluate outside counsel, and monitor and assess spend. These changes may appear simple compared to what's around the corner for helping corporate legal innovate.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here are the five in-house counsel technology trends to seize as we move into 2018.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Data Security Solutions</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While not a new focus, data security is priority one for most. More than six in ten in-house counsel identify the growing threat to cyber&shy;security as the number one litigation risk exposure for their organizations. Information security audits are now a daily occurrence for legal service and technology providers. The once-&shy;perceived law firm exemption is now a distant memory, with firms being screened no differently than any other provider that stores corporate data. Last year also brought the largest remediated breach today with Equifax, involving data from up to 143 million consumers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As we move into 2018, information security is being viewed through a whole new lens as the European Union's looming General Data Protection Regulation leaves corporations around the world scrambling to raise their compliance bar. This entails balancing the need to be prepared to deal with individual inquiries regarding the size and scope of personal information retained with the challenge of complying with an individual's request that their personal information be expunged from a corporation's data sets altogether. Assessing the cost of GDPR compliance against potentially astronomical fines of up to 4 percent of global annual revenue has cemented data security as the trend that is not going away anytime soon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To help in-house counsel cope with the data security challenge of 2018, look for new technology offerings that will enhance mobile data management. Cloud providers also will offer better risk management strategies for moving data off corporate networks and into a secure cloud environment. Enhanced software platforms will focus on finding more efficient ways to improve corporate information governance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Matter Management Platforms</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like data security, matter management is not a new topic. Yet in-house counsel are welcoming this trend as the need for help remains evident. According to Altman Weil's 2017 Chief Legal Officer Survey, 79 percent of all corporate legal departments provide guidelines for matter staffing and matter management, but only 60 percent routinely enforce those guidelines. A surge in tech innovation, coupled with critical enterprise application integration, has transformed dormant matter management platforms into robust solutions that automate tasks like opening a new matter, providing a centralized repository for all matter data, and proactively managing costs by rightsizing workload and staffing needs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the new technology for matter management is driven by in-house corporate legal departments, but alternative service providers looking to help corporate legal teams have ramped up their focus to innovate in this space.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I recently caught up with the team at Elevate Services, a firm that is leading the charge in this area. Notes Pratik Patel, the company's VP, innovation and products: &quot;Matter management/e-billing currently serves as the central nervous system for most law departments, but often lacks necessary features and/or workflow to capture and manage work from start to finish. This causes an incomplete picture of what the true demand is on the legal department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Further, the limitation of these products creates a huge opportunity for complementary entrants into the market that are designed to help law departments complete their enterprise legal management strategy. On the front end, these may include Neota Logic's AI expert systems and workflow to help intake/triage legal work. In the middle, they may include Elevate's Cael Select or Cael Project to help select or project-manage legal work, and on the tail end, Cael Vision for roll-up analytics and dashboards.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With so many fresh approaches available through technology companies, legal services and law firms, 2018 will see a rise in corporate legal teams better managing their work and outside counsel through matter management solutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Artificial Intelligence Just as e-discovery changed the legal industry 20 years ago, artificial intelligence is disrupting how lawyers get work done today. At a panel at the 2017 Association of Corporate Counsel annual meeting, more than 80 percent of attendees said they were looking to deploy AI-&shy;powered solutions within their company or department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are two deep and abiding truths in the legal industry,&quot; writes Joe Patrice in &quot;Above the Law.&quot; &quot;No one knows what AI even means, and, yes, you need it.&quot; While the definition of AI remains in flux, there are a growing number of legal technologies focused on automating cognitive tasks typically thought to require human intelligence. From pattern recognition and prediction to complex decision making, AI performs these tasks in an industry requiring an &shy;understanding vast amounts of unstructured data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regardless of the technology type, AI boils down to rules. Simple, or not so simple, AI is rules applied to data to offer conclusions. When applied to legal, the conclusions may take the form of:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Identifying and categorizing patterns (Kira Systems, RAVN) Determining relevance, as in the case of legal research or document review (Ross Intelligence, Relativity, CS Disco, Everlaw) Scaling knowledge bases, highlighting risk, validating compliance or automating best practice recommendations, as in the case of expert systems (Neota Logic).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are several principles to keep in mind while working with AI. Think big but start small. Focus on solving simple problems that are creating pain across broad sets of stakeholders across your organization. Leveraging proof of concept is a great way to demonstrate early and fast wins to create the top-down organizational consensus required for successful deployment of an AI project. Remember that resources are required. Stakeholder expectations must be managed carefully to ensure participants understand this is as much about people and process as it is about the technology. Simply plugging the technology into a wall does not magically make it work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Machine learning, neural networks or natural language process projects can require significant data sets and investments around system training before the technology can yield an effective return on investment. Expert systems require codification of institutional subject matter expertise and knowledge engineering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That said, there are several proven use cases for these technologies that can have an immediate impact. In the realm of expert systems, legal teams are leveraging solutions like Neota Logic to automate expertise, internal/client workflows, legal process and the &shy;creation of documents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The design, build and use of expert systems by corporate legal teams will no doubt be on the rise this year, among efforts to provide more convenient service delivery and to decrease costs. In-house legal teams are also beginning to build their own on-demand apps to deploy legal and compliance guidance across the organization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2018, the ways that AI will be used to radically transform the legal industry will grow exponentially, as the traditional law firm model is increasingly &shy;pressured to find a better way to deliver legal services. Corporate legal teams are piloting the technology more every day with an eye toward quality improvement and efficiency gains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Document Automation The legal industry has been experimenting with document automation for 30 years. In 2018, watch for further innovation in the area of document lifecycle management technologies, due to an investment surge aimed at improving document automation outputs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recent technology advances like AI have also garnered a whole new set of solutions to automate document creation, routing and approval. Template software on the market today will continue to become more advanced, allowing for automatic updates to standard wording as law changes. And as document automation software becomes easier to use, there's less ramp-up time - users can license it today and use it tomorrow, as in Neota &shy;Logic's self-service document automation solution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Document automation - which is also viewed as a pragmatic starting place for applying AI to solve legal work challenges - will likely see an uptick in adoption by corporate teams in the next year. To get started with document automation, or to improve what you're doing today, identify your company's largest document-related pain point. Is it the creation, routing and approval of nondisclosure agreements? Or does your company have a large employee base requiring business associate agreements? Focus in on a specific deliverable and identify the challenges. Then explore the technology options available to solve it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Blockchain</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similar to AI last year, blockchain is positioned to join the fold as a top-of-mind technology. While the most publicized application of the technology has been in the world of cryptocurrency - and the incredible rise of Bitcoin and &shy;Ethereum in 2017 - the legal community has started to explore and embrace methods to leverage blockchain, with early adopters implementing solutions like smart contracts in their daily operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When we spoke recently about what's ahead for legal tech, Danny &shy;Thankachan, director, practice technology, at Blank Rome and a frequent speaker on blockchain for legal, told me that he sees blockchain disrupting the industry in two primary ways over the next few years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The first is in identity validation and protection,&quot; &shy;Thankachan said, &quot;where you will need nothing more than the ability to perform a write to the public ledger using a private key to authenticate a transaction. With this you could, for example, purchase a car without having to provide your name.&quot; Thankachan sees this public/private key application replacing, among other things, the archaic Social Security number system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The second area for disruption is in document security and control,&quot; he adds, &quot;being able to control exactly where a document exists for consumption while maintaining the ability to remove it or lock all versions down.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While these use cases and their associated legal implications continue to take shape, it will be both fascinating and soon critical to embrace the technology in order to stay ahead of the curve.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2018: The Year for Action</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Breakthrough technologies leveraging AI and expert systems are bringing significant efficiency gains and making all of this possible for legal teams. Despite the accelerated pace of change, the technological disruption occurring in legal is a process, not a switch. There's a growing opportunity for legal service providers to leverage tech-enabled solutions to drive efficiency, reduce risk and demonstrate immediate ROI.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In other words, explore your options, be proactive by identifying today's version of the 75-CD &shy;challenge, and look for the best solutions to align with those problems - and get building.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An annotated review of Information Governance Insights columns from 2017</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The scope of corporate counsel duties has changed rather rapidly and drastically in the past decade. As companies have quickly begun to digitalize nearly every aspect of their operations, digital information has become the lifeblood and primary asset of nearly all business, in every industry, in every sector. Whether a company makes or sells widgets, transports goods or people, facilitates markets or financial transactions, or provides services of any sort, in the past few years it has also become an information business. The volume of digital information flowing through companies has also grown exponentially in this same short period. Rapid digital transformation has brought to the forefront a whole host of novel legal issues that cannot be ignored. Information creates great value to the enterprise, and anything of value also presents risk. This shift has in turn pushed counsel into the role of information stewards, charged with ensuring that the mountains of data collected, created, stored and utilized across the enterprise are managed in a compliant and responsible manner and properly protected.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most litigators first become aware of these data mountains when struggling to respond to discovery requests. Electronic discovery has been a primary component of most legal department budgets for nearly a decade now, at least since it was first formally recognized by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Today it is a significant cost for nearly every legal matter. The scope of e-discovery has equally expanded. Early matters focused nearly exclusively on email communications and loose electronic office documents. Yet, as the proliferation of data across the corporate environment has expanded, e-discovery has begun to implicate a much larger breadth of systems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nowhere is this more evident than with the challenges of preserving, collecting and disclosing information from structured database systems, which I detailed in April 2017 (see &quot;Preserving and Collecting Structured Electronic Data Is Tricky&quot;). The identification and collection of information from these systems can be very complex. Unlike email systems, which tend to be static over time, most corporate database systems have grown organically over decades and have been pieced together through multiple rounds of mergers and acquisitions. They also tend to be transactional in nature and not designed to meet the needs of litigations, which are often aimed at re-creating history. Isolating potentially relevant information and extracting it into a reasonably usable format is a very complex task. These challenges are so great, in fact, that my firm has built a specialized practice group solely dedicated to extracting and analysing structured data for litigation purposes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No part of e-discovery is easy, and counsel should not have to go at it alone. Nor should they need to reinvent the wheel for each new matter. As part of fulfilling their role as corporate data steward, they need to team with trusted advisors who can share industry best practices and their experience toward solving these complex problems. In this quest, it may often be difficult to know where to draw the line when deciding what to attempt on your own and when to get help (see April's &quot;Bringing E-Discovery In-House&quot;). In the face of mounting budget constraints, it also can be tempting to try bring the whole spectrum of e-discovery services in-house. In November, I discussed some of these challenges and provided insight into how to measure the true value of e-discovery services when working with and assessing vendors (see &quot;Measuring the True Costs of E-Discovery&quot;).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">E-discovery isn't corporate counsel's only data challenge, however. Today's regulatory environments also require that counsel properly leverage corporate data assets to meet the company's compliance obligations. For example, anti-money laundering and anticorruption regulations around the globe now require the analysis of complex data sets in a proactive manner in order to avoid missing red flags and anomalous client behaviors. Companies must also be proactive in order to take advantage of penalty reduction programs that favor self-disclosure (see &quot;Spotting Corruption in the Wild&quot;). Unfortunately, with mountains of data to sift through, the only way compliance programs can root out potential misconduct is to custom-tailor analytical procedures so that they can locate the anomalous signals in all the daily noise. Enforcement agencies themselves, such as the Department of Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, have all instituted their own data analytics programs, which alone clearly evidences the need for corporate counsel to stay ahead of the curve and ascend the digital mountain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other challenges come in the form of data protection requirements. Hardly a day passes without a new data breach headline in the news, and hardly a month goes by without a new data protection regulation of some form or another being enacted. Foremost on most companies' radar today is the pending General Data Protection Regulation that takes effect this spring across the European Union. Since its extraterritorial reach extends to any company that has business activities in the EU or that directly market goods or services to individuals in the EU, even U.S. companies are scrambling to assess the regulation's level of applicability and to understand their obligations. The biggest obstacle thus far seems to be understanding exactly how far the many new obligations under the GDPR go, and how to operationalize them across the entire enterprise. Data is highly ubiquitous in large organizations, and it can be very difficult to ferret out all the places it is stored and all the ways it is being used. This is especially true when commingled with data from other sources that may be subject to an entirely different set of regulatory protections and obligations, such as the personal information of individuals from Asian or North or South American countries, each of which have their own data protection laws. Many of these systems are also quite old and have been cobbled together over many years. They simply were not designed to carve out all the various populations and apply different sets of controls to each for compliance purposes. This alone has led to significantly large burdens on companies that have larger fragmented data systems or systems that are highly siloed by business function.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To address these issues, the most important thing corporate counsel can do right now is data mapping. Counsel must spend the time to fully understand exactly what personal information they collect, manage and process, from whom, for what purposes, and where and how it is being used. If they are unable to do this, they cannot even begin to understand their compliance obligations and what they need to do to close any gaps in this regard. This exercise should also look at international data flows and seek to understand what the legal basis is for legitimizing the transfers. As discussed in &quot;Data Map Now to Ease GDPR Compliance,&quot; it should also map out all the third-party service providers that are processing data on the company's behalf and ensure that the proper contractual protections are in place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As if all of this was not complex enough for us mere attorneys, in come the clouds. Cloud storage has itself taken center stage for the majority of corporate IT departments as they struggle to reduce capital expenditures and move company data off to third-party service providers. However, with this shift in storage also comes a shift in roles and responsibilities and increased risks and liabilities. Data privacy regulations such as the GDPR and domestic data privacy and security laws are typically storage agnostic. Transferring data to a third party's cloud environment does not reduce corporate responsibility to protect the data. However, the many different models of cloud storage, which range from Software as a Service (SaaS) to Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and multiple iterations in between, can make it difficult to know which party is tasked with ensuring which controls and where the handoffs between them need to occur. (See &quot;Managing Cyber Risk in the Cloud.&quot;) It can also be difficult to ascertain which country's laws apply to data and systems hosted in a distributed cloud environment, which only further complicates things. (See &quot;Whose Laws Govern That Slippery Data? Storage in the cloud has complicated the question for companies and courts.&quot;) In order to address these issues, counsel must have a clear understanding of what information is flowing to cloud environments, where it is being stored, and where the responsibility for each and every security control lies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to these new data steward roles for corporate counsel, in-house legal departments must ensure they are adequately prepared when the inevitable data breach hits. Responding to data breaches can be a tricky business. If not managed correctly, corporate liability can easily be exponentially compounded. The key to successfully managing any complex crisis lies in the planning. It's important to develop a carefully thought-out process long before the fire alarms start ringing. For example, nearly all 50 states now have data breach notification requirements, some requiring notice as soon as 45 days after discovering an event. Since the average breach investigation can take months to determine what, if anything, was actually exposed, counsel will not be able to meet these tight deadlines without significant planning upfront. (See &quot;The Data Breach Response: Who Will You Tell?&quot;) Notification is also not the only hurdle. There is a whole plethora of liabilities to be addressed for both the company and its directors and officers, especially once the post-breach lawsuits pile on. (See &quot;Data Breaches Can Paint a Bullseye on Their Backs - Companies need to focus on mitigating liability for their directors and officers.&quot;) Unless counsel is up to speed on all these issues and has a response plan in place before trouble hits, they are likely to not survive the ordeal. Last year alone saw multiple general counsel stepping down in the wake of data breaches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But all is not lost. Counsel who assert their role as the steward of corporate data can ensure that their company's most important business assets remain secure and that its risks - legal and otherwise - are kept to a minimum. For insight on proactive steps to take to help you tackle that data mountain, see the article &quot;Four Things Lawyers Can Do to Improve Cyber-Risk Programs: You need to think of yourself as both a steward and a shepherd.&quot; Just don't forget to bring your climbing gear.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alexa tops Apple... Amazon's strategy for its Alexa digital assistant is sharply focused on commerce; if more people use Alexa instead of Siri or Google Assistant, more people can shop by voice command. Already riding high on Echo Dot sales - Amazon's small, budget-priced speaker was its top selling device during the 2017 holiday season - the e-commerce giant has also secured itself a comfy spot atop Apple's own App Store. The Alexa app is used to configure Alexa-enabled devices such as the Echo Dot, and for the first time ever the Alexa app has won the top spot on Apple's U.S. App Store on Christmas, a spot it held through Wednesday,TechCrunchreports. Last year, the Alexa app reached fourth place. The ranking is notable because it represents a fully new audience for Amazon's digital assistant; anyone who already owned an Alexa device likely had the app installed already, and would not have contributed to this year's ranking, the article notes.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">...but Apple tops everyone else: The smartphone race is, in part, also a mobile wallet race. People who buy iPhones will have access to Apple Pay; people with Samsung handsets could opt for Samsung Pay; and buyers of other Android devices may prefer Android Pay. So it's a pretty big deal for Apple Pay that Apple products were far and away the leader for device activations leading up to the holiday season, according to data fromFlurry. Forty-four percent of new phone and tablet activations were Apple products, according to Flurry. This nearly doubles the 26% of Samsung activations and dwarfs the third-place manufacturer, Huawei. Google's Pixel 2 flagship is conspicuously absent, which may be an issue of marketing or limited variety in the Pixel lineup; breaking down iPhone activations, Flurry tracks 10 different products ranging from the iPhone 6 to the new iPhone X.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Big spenders: The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau on Wednesday reported that outstanding consumer credit card debt last year had surpassed the peak set during the recession. Credit card debt hit $807 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016, according to the352-page reportreleased by the agency. Consumers held average credit card balances of more than $4,800 at the end of last year, the highest figure the CFPB found in its data, which runs through mid-2017. The report noted that large banks had a return on credit card assets last year that was three times the overall return on assets for commercial banks. The CFPB said the credit card market is largely stable with one key exception: rising interest rates on variable rate accounts. Though the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure (CARD) Act of 2009 generally prohibits credit card issuers from raising interest rates on existing balances, the law allows issuers to raise rates on many cards when an index rate increases. Many issuers have taken advantage of that loophole.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Europe's privacy law set to change how personal data is handled around the globeThe Hill | Wed Dec 27, 2017 - Historically, privacy concerns have been a lower priority than convenience and wealth. But over the years, people, organizations and governments have come to realize the negative impact a breach of private information can have consumers. As a result, we have seen an increasing number of privacy laws passed by governments across the globe over time. The European Union (EU) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is the latest privacy-based regulation, and its effective date is quickly approaching. Organizations worldwide must be ready to comply with many stringent requirements starting May 25, 2018. It will impact organizations across the globe that handle personal data for EU residents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">China moves to impose order on mobile payments boomFinancial Times | Thu Dec 28, 2017 - China's central bank has tightened rules on mobile payments made by scanning a barcode, imposing restrictions that could slow the explosive growth for Alibaba's financial services affiliate and that of its main rival, Tencent. The regulations set daily limits on the amount consumers can spend each day using barcode-based payments. They also forbid &quot;burning money&quot; via subsidies to merchants, which are designed to capture market share from competitors. China leads the world in mobile payments, most of which are executed by scanning a QR code. While some scans use a specialised point-of-sale (POS) terminal, others occur between mobile phones or when the consumer scans a decal posted near the checkout area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While bitcoin falls, one cryptocurrency jumps 20% after new link to some Japanese credit card companiesCNBC | Wed Dec 27, 2017 - The digital currency rose 20 percent to a record high of $1.43, making it the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization at $54 billion, behind bitcoin and ethereum, according to CoinMarketCap. The gains followed news that Tokyo-based financial services company SBI Holdings and its subsidiary SBI Ripple Asia - formed with Ripple in 2016 - announced the establishment of a &quot;consortium&quot; with some Japanese credit card companies to utilize blockchain technology, according to an online translation of a release. &quot;One of the things we all have to remember is the value of a token over the long term is really going to be driven by its utility,&quot; Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said on CNBC's &quot;Squawk Alley.&quot; &quot;There's no question there's a lot of hype in this system.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On May 25, 2018, the EU's new General Data Protection Rules take effect forcing companies worldwide to comply with a fundamental change to the way businesses manage and distribute data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new regulations are not a 'nice to take notice of' initiative; but rather a &quot;~must comply with' piece of legislation. The challenge is that because it is a significant shift in the way that data-centric businesses operate (and what business today doesn't rely on data for all it does?), the challenge to comply is formidable. As a result, many businesses appear stuck in 'analysis paralysis', incapable of implementing strategies to meet the GDPR challenge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How can you break through that paralysis? How can you get started on the path to compliance? In short, where do you start?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First, let's remind ourselves what is behind the GDPR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the most foundational level, it is about stopping the misuse of personal data by organizations who may be tempted to use that data to engage in intrusive, unwanted marketing activities. We have all suffered such targeting and know how annoying it is. So, one of the key tenets of GDPR will be that it requires organizations to prove that any data they store is necessary to the running of the business, rather than being used for marketing activities. Within every business, there are obviously many different and disparate data streams making it tough to create an easily auditable view of the data and, in turn, prove why it is essential to the running of the business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, let's imagine it is found that a retailer, at the point of purchase, is scanning the color of people's' eyes as they pay. The company will now have to explain why it is doing that. Perhaps, it is an optician that has a legitimate reason for capturing this data, as it helps provide better aftercare to customers. But even if the reasons are entirely honorable, a company still needs to be able to explain the data processes downstream from the till to ensure that, if checked, the process does indeed comply with GDPR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This example illustrates that, however data is collected, after May 25 of next year, it will have to be both identifiable and auditable as well as accessible upon request.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, the only way to effectively ensure this is the case, is to create a kind of map of all the data stored by a company, identify where a particular piece of data sits, tag it and, in order to satisfy &quot;~access upon request' requirements, it needs to either be stored somewhere with extract capabilities or the ability to build those extract capabilities quickly. In addition, the purpose of that data must be able to be explained. It must also be shown that running business requires that information and, most critically, that people have opted into releasing their data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And that, my friends, is a very time-consuming task.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moving forward, solutions will have to focus on the importance of ensuring that data is both identifiable and auditable and has two core products to help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On a proactive basis, data infrastructure automation software, can go off and discover data areas and tag areas of concern. It can be used to map out all data systems within the organizations, providing a really effective means of auditing and cataloguing data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On a reactive basis, if ever a company is asked to prove anything about a particular piece of data, or to pull multiple trails together quickly for an export request, data infrastructure automation software, will need to supply a full lineage of that data trail. With the ability to define an extract that pulls together all data related to a particular person from all areas across the business in less than 30 days, there is no need for the user to build these extractors in advance, and they can be reused the next time a request is made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When capabilities like these are combined, data infrastructure automation software can retrospectively go out and catalog all of a company's data, and easily enable complex data extraction. Complying with GDPR represents significant challenges to all businesses. But the first, and most important step is to quickly get to a point where you can both identify and audit your data. From here, the roadmap to GDPR compliance will suddenly look a lot clearer.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Custodian banks will have a new focus in 2018, as the raft of regulation that has preoccupied them for the past few years shifts down the agenda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sources said 2018 will be about digitization of custody and asset services, as the low-yield environment forces clients to look for more granular data, better flexibility in accessing data and more frequent reporting of this data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Custodians contacted by Pensions &amp; Investments are preparing a suite of enhancements to help institutions interpret real-time data.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Daron Pearce, CEO of global financial institutions at BNY Mellon Asset Servicing in London, said: &quot;The tsunami of regulation which we faced in recent years has peaked ... which means that we can now spend more time on developing new capabilities and new infrastructure to help our clients get better access to data.&quot; BNY Mellon has $30 trillion in assets under custody.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chris Rowland, global head of custody at J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co. in London, said: &quot;Clients already look at their custodians to aggregate information coming from multiple sources - scrub, structure and validate it. Increased digitization will boost the ability to streamline, enhance and enrich the flow of information, to generate deeper insight for clients.&quot; J.P. Morgan has $20.5 trillion in assets under custody.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To provide the enhanced data, custodial banks are making upgrades aimed at more powerful and faster trade execution capabilities, in addition to introducing tools that will help asset owners brace for reporting next year under a number of new rules, such as the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II, and certain other pieces of regulation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Penelope Biggs, head of strategy for corporate and institutional services at Northern Trust Corp. in London, said: &quot;Enhancing our data and digital architecture and the client experience will be our top priority.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She added: &quot;Our partnership with BEx LLC to deliver a foreign exchange algorithmic trading capability ... will help clients access enhanced liquidity and enables (Northern Trust) to drive more transparency in the foreign exchange market.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MiFID II, which has preoccupied much of financial firms' time in 2017, is also giving custodians the chance to compete when it comes to making life a little easier for their clients. The European directive requires sell-side firms to separate the cost of trade execution and research so buy-side firms can make explicit payments for research.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jeff Conway, CEO, Europe, Middle East and Africa at State Street Corp. in London, said his firm is providing tools that combine machine-learning and human intelligence, allowing institutions to access research in one place. State Street has $28 trillion under custody.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Center stage</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to new tools aimed at tackling traditional asset classes, the custody of digital assets emerged as a theme for global custodians and quickly took center stage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John van Verre, global head of custody at HSBC Securities Services in London, listed the development of digital applications like programming interfaces and the custody of digital assets among key priorities for HSBC, which has $6.3 trillion in assets under custody, in 2018.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We recently sponsored an investigation into the potential for using distributed ledger technology to enable proxy voting solutions for our custody business,&quot; Mr. van Verre said. &quot;These have the potential to deliver benefits such as secure simultaneous voting by all parties, visibility of votes in progress and of course an accelerated process with the elimination of massive amounts of paper.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Increasing digitization of the custody business will become a key differentiator for custodians when it comes to winning or losing business, said sources. That means custodians need to make significant investments in their infrastructure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Ms. Biggs, Northern Trust's planned investment into technology for 2016-2018 averages $2.5 billion for core architecture, infrastructure and capability development, but she said this figure does not include significant dollars invested annually in tech innovation, IT partnerships and strategic investments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some regulation remains</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While sources said access to vast stores of data through new technology will generate valuable insights to support investment decisions, a few pieces of regulation still will have to be faced by institutional investors in 2018, including the ramifications of variation margin requirements or money market fund reform.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And global custodians are gearing up to provide tools that will help asset owners cope in the new year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The EU money market reform coming into effect during 2018 prompted some custodians to offer technology that provides net asset value oversight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Conway said State Street's &quot;digitization initiative provides NAV oversight, benchmarks NAV to identify divergences; and generates NAVs in real-time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others focused on variation margin requirements. &quot;Going further into 2018, HSBC will deliver multiple products in areas including variation margin and collateral management services, configured data extracts, China Bond Connect (products) and research payment account solutions,&quot; Mr. Van Verre said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But preparation for the most significant piece of regulation this year, the Global Data Protection Regulation, which comes into force in May, remains uncertain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wendy Phillis, head of governance and regulatory solutions, Europe and APAC at RBC Investor &amp; Treasury Services in London, said: &quot;Clients subject to GDPR will need to have controls and processes in place around collection and maintenance of EU citizen personal data, including obtaining explicit consent to collect and use personal data.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Arguably one of the more challenging aspects of GDPR is the 'right to be forgotten' which gives the individual the right to demand that a firm delete all data related to that individual. Personal data will likely exist in many different systems so developing systems and processes to remove it may prove difficult. We've implemented a change program, with representation from key stakeholders across the business, to ensure the requirements of GDPR and the evolving privacy expectations of our clients are met.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vol. 1</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">No. 1</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Digital transformation was definitely the buzz phrase of 2017. And while many businesses like Airbnb, Amazon, Uber, and others have created game-changing industries leveraging data, the majority of businesses use less than one percent of their available data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has been a real catalyst for investing in data governance. However, organizations are recognizing that if they are to make the investment, it needs to impact both the top and bottom line.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With that said, here are five GDPR and data governance predictions for 2018:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GDPR will be the new Y2K.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Remember when we partied like it was 1999? CIOs around the world scrambled to ensure that their systems were Y2K-compliant for the stroke of midnight Jan 1, 2000. We feared that planes would fall from the sky, the financial system would halt, and all-around Armageddon would ensue, so we spent an estimated $300 billion (half of that in the United States).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On May 25, 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation will go into effect. To process personal customer data under GDPR, businesses will need to document their reasoning and show a legal basis as to why they require personal data. Penalties for failing to meet GDPR requirements could lead to fines of up to \xE2,\xAC20 million or 4 percent of the company's global annual turnover for the previous year, whichever is greater. This level of financial penalty could have a serious impact on a company's future, so you will see businesses scrambling to prepare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Data Governance 2.0 will take hold because Data Governance 1.0 was a failure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The age of data governance 1.0 was characterized by IT serving as data custodians, mainly cataloging data elements without a grasp of their meaning or relationships. Consequently, the costs of controlling data risk often became needlessly excessive and opportunities to drive business agility were missed. It was a total failure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2018, data governance 2.0 will shine as it moves out of IT's shadow to encompass the entire enterprise. CFOs, CMOs and all data stakeholders will be involved in data governance, not just traditional data stewards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Data governance will be vital to all aspects of data, including master data management, business intelligence, IoT and AI.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Social media, cars, TVs, refrigerators, thermostats, etc., - everything is connected and producing vast new quantities of data. Big data is only getting bigger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First, organizations will need to be able to process this data at high speed. Second, organizations will need a strategy to manage and integrate this never-ending data stream. Even small chunks of data will accumulate into large volumes if they arrive fast enough, which is why it's critical for organizations to invest in data architecture, management and governance. All of this new data is disparate, it's noisy, and in its raw form it's often useless.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So to unlock data's aforementioned potential, organizations must take the necessary steps to &quot;clean it up.&quot; And with all this data comes tremendous risk. To do this, organizations will need to have an effective strategy to discover, understand, govern and socialize their data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Increased focus on data governance will accelerate digital transformation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2017, digital transformation was all the buzz. However, with enterprises only tapping into less than one percent of their overall data, we've yet to see the full impact of the transformation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While organizations have historically viewed data governance as a compliance exercise, the fact is that data governance is the foundation for digital transformation. As organizations expand DG out of IT and into the business, and as organizations dedicate resources to prepare for GDPR, you'll see data being used in more meaningful and game-changing ways.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Data governance will change the way the business views and consumes data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Organizations will begin to treat their data assets in the same way they treat physical assets to reduce the regulatory and reputational risks to the organization, as well as see it as a valuable resource that helps employees excel in their day-to-day jobs.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Data security threats continue to grow in frequency and intensity, and nearly every organization has now been targeted or expects to be. So what can we expect in 2018 on the IT security front? Here are predictions for 10 top data security trends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Security blossoms in the boardroom</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sadly, security breaches will continue to be a regular occurrence in 2018 and organizations will struggle to deal with them. New security challenges will abound and these will grab attention in the boardroom. Senior management is increasingly focusing on security issues and recognizing them as a core business risk, rather than the responsibility of the IT department alone. The coming year will see further commitment from the boardroom to ensure that organizations are protected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Ransomware has not gone away</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Too much money is being made from ransomware for it to disappear - it won't.According to Cyber Security Ventures, global ransomware damage costs for 2017 will exceed US$ 5 billion, with the average amount paid in ransom among office workers around US$ 1400.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Companies can help prevent ransomware by tracking everything coming in and out of the network and running AV solutions with anti- ransomware protection. And, of course, you should do regular backups to a structured plan, based around your own business requirements - and make sure you test the plans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. IoT - a security time-bomb</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Internet of Things is a rapidly growing phenomenon which will accelerate in 2018, as both consumers and businesses opt for the convenience and benefits that IoT brings. However, manufacturers are not yet routinely building security into IoT devices and 2018 will see further problems generated through the use of insecure IoT.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IoT is a major threat and possibly the biggest threat to businesses in the coming years. Unfortunately, it is not easy, and in some cases impossible, to bolt on security as an afterthought with IoT, and many organizations will find it challenging to deal with the consequences of such breaches. As IoT cascades through organizations' infrastructures, it is likely to become the ultimate Trojan horse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. More from the Shadow Brokers</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Shadow Brokers, a hacker group which stole hacking tools from the American National Security Agency (NSA), created havoc in 2017 with the Wannacry ransomware episode. The group has already stated that it will soon release newer NSA hacking tools, with targets that might include vulnerabilities in Windows 10.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There will certainly be further episodes from them in 2018, so patch management, security and regular backups will be more crucial than ever. A major target of these hackers is the data that organizations hold, including PII (Personally Identifiable Information) and corporate data, so protecting the data &quot;~crown jewels' inside the network will become ever more crucial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. GDPR - have most businesses missed the point?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The arrival of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in May 2018 will, of course, be a big story. However, many organizations are missing the main point about GDPR. It is about identifying, protecting and managing PII - any information that could potentially identify a specific individual. This will become more important in 2018 and there will be considerable focus on identifying, securing and, where required, deleting PII held on networks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. GDPR blackmail - the new ransomware?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unfortunately, GDPR will give a great opportunity to criminals, hackers, disgruntled staff and anyone who might want to do an organisation harm. They simply have to ask you to identify what data you hold on them, ask for it to be erased, and ask for proof that it has been done. If you can't comply, they can threaten to go public - exposing you to the risk of huge fines - unless you pay them money. Watch out for that one!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. DDoS on the rise</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is now possible for anyone to &quot;~rent' a DDoS attack on the internet. For as little as US$ 5, you can actuallypay someoneto do the attack for you! This is just one of the reasons DDoS threats will continue to escalate in 2018, alongside the cost of dealing with them. The dangers of DDoS for smaller companies are that it will leave them unable to do business. For larger organisations, DDoS attacks can overwhelm systems. Remember that DDoS is significantly under-reported, as no-one wants to admit they have been under attack!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Cloud insecurity - it's up to you</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Problems with cloud insecurity will continue to grow in 2018 as users put more and more data on the cloud, without, in many cases, properly working out how to secure it. It is not the cloud providers' responsibility to secure the information - it is down to the user. With the introduction of GDPR in 2018, it will be even more important to ensure that PII stored in the cloud is properly protected. Failure to do so could bring serious financial consequences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. The insider threat</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Historically, insider threats have been underestimated, yet they were still a primary cause of security incidents in 2017. The causes may be malicious actions by staff or simply poor staff cyber-hygiene - i.e. staff not using the appropriate behavior required to ensure online &quot;health.&quot; In 2018, there will be growth in cyber education, coupled with more testing, measuring and monitoring of staff behavior. This increasingly involves training and automated testing, such as simulated phishing and social engineering attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. Time to ditch those simple passwords</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2018, simple passwords will be even more highlighted as an insecure &quot;~secure' method of access. Once a password is compromised, then all other sites with that same user password are also vulnerable. As staff often use the same passwords for business as they use personally, businesses are left vulnerable. While complex passwords do have a superficial attraction, there are many challenges around that approach and multi-factor authentication is a vastly superior method of access.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c6">GDPR and the human element of personal data protection</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trent Pettis</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vol. 1</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">No. 1</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">860  words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The General Data Protection Regulation is set to be a fact of life in less than six months, and arguably the biggest challenge facing enterprises across the globe is locating personal data sources and classifying them correctly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most businesses will have some degree of legacy data, whether paper or digital, and before taking any technical steps at all it is essential to ensure that this personal data locked in ERP and CRM systems is classified according to risk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the general thrust of GDPR has been widely debated in the media and among security industry peers, much of the coverage to date has focussed on the huge penalties for non-compliance, rather than looking at the opportunities of data discovery and process improvements for enterprises of all shapes and sizes.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed,a recent studyfound that 60% of EU organisations say they will face serious challenges in being GDPR-compliant, and in fact 40% of respondents report that their organisations do not view compliance with GDPR by the deadline as a priority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Geographical complications</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is all a matter of fact, rather than conjecture, but business responses to GDPR and its implications have varied considerably in my experience. Anecdotally, not many European and UK organisations have been giving the regulation enforcement date as a high priority as perhaps they could have done. Some will only be kicking off in December 2017, leaving them a mere six months to comply.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">US companies are generally speaking not particularly prepared, and the complexity of the legal landscape is going to make it difficult for those who have not thought ahead. For example, companies with significant operations such as head offices outside the EU face the issue of adequacy, so will potentially need to construct a lawful mechanism to transfer data. The model contract clause is one such mechanism, another is binding corporate rules, but this mechanism does require prior planning, and approval from theICO.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Geography and legalities aside, the most important element of a robust GDPR strategy is to evaluate people and processes first - technology is a facilitator to the processes that need to be put in place. This initiative is not a tickbox compliance approach, and there is no plugin or tool that will simply make it all go away. On the positive side, there is plenty of opportunity to take this watershed moment in personal data management and look at harmonising company data policies, which have often grown up over time with significant overlap.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Data discovery</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finding the precise location of data defined as &quot;~personal' under GDPR from amongst the thousands of tables and columns (or fields) in complex and customised packaged systems, represents a significant challenge. Traditional tools and methods, such as searching for documentation, using templates and reference models or employing external consultants, do not address the challenge in an effective and timely fashion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Safyroffers an interesting approach - it interfaces with all the most popular ERP and CRM solutions in order to speed up that discovery process. Speed and accuracy here are vital for several reasons - obviously &quot;~bad' data discovery initially means that risk assessments will be skewed, and even worse it may cause a loss of focus, so that less critical issues are fixed first, rather than the real high risk issues. These issues are the major benefit of using a discovery tool, rather than attempting hand cranked scripted procedures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Data protection impact assessment</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unstructured data will be a major challenge for many organisations because of the nebulous nature of it and obtaining full information about it. For example, Salesforce, which historically slurps up huge amounts of information that might not be essential for everyday business, but will be highly relevant in a GDPR context.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The result is hidden risk, where in the event of a data breach business could be exposed to far greater penalties than they think if information is not correctly categorised. All new systems or updates to data systems should have a completedata protection impact assessment(DPIA) - as mandated under article 35 - that assess the risk profile, as well as facilitating the scoping of a new system. A DPIA is an excellent programme management technique, and should from now be a matter of course - if it was not before!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Information asset register</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another vital element of preparation for and compliance with GDPR is the setting up of an Information Asset register, which is specifically detailed under article 30. The aim is to inventory all the systems, electronic and paper based, that hold personal information. Data glossaries and/or data dictionaries support this register, and there are plenty of tools that can help with this, including many content management systems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Overall, the imminent arrival of GDPR should be seen as a fantastic opportunity to get in-house policies, systems and technologies into shape, as well as demonstrating compliance in time for the deadline. While many enterprises are only just beginning to get started, those with the longest runup will be those with the fewest unforeseen problems come mid-2018.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The European Union's new data privacy protections are spurring draconian efforts by companies to insure compliance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Known as the General Data Protection Regulation or GDPR for short, the new rules take effect this May and could lead to devastating fines for organizations that fail to comply. So, companies are responding by passing the buck to their employees through various penalties, contracts and disciplinary procedures.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Astudyconducted byVeritas Technologiesfinds that nearly nine out 10 companies with 1,000 employees or more plan to drive changes in employee behavior, as it relates to the GDPR, through a combination of training, rewards, penalties and contracts. And almost half (47 percent) intend to add mandatory GDPR policy adherence into their employment agreements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Failure to adhere to these agreements could have dire consequences for employees. Four out of 10 of the global survey respondents plan to implement various disciplinary procedures if GDPR policies are violated. One out of four of the businesses polled are considering withholding benefits-including bonuses-from employees found to be non-compliant. But, at the same time, just over a third (34 percent) say they will reward employees for adhering to the new GDPR policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inadequate data governanceMost of the survey's 900 respondents (91 percent) concede that their organization's current data governance is inadequate. And a sizable majority (63 percent) believe that employees should receive mandatory training on GDPR policies. Most respondents indicated that this was especially important for members of the IT and legal departments, business strategists, salespeople and employees who work in finance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Data is one of the most critical assets within an organization, yet many businesses are struggling to implement good data hygiene practices-and that often starts with employees,&quot; says Mike Palmer, executive vice president and chief product officer for Veritas, which develops cloud-based infrastructure optimization software. &quot;However, our research shows that businesses are getting serious about driving cultural change within their organizations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While avoiding severe regulatory penalties and fines is clearly the main motivation for the companies seeking to improve their data governance practices, per the survey, the vast majority (95 percent) see additional business benefits to achieving GDPR compliance.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The term IoT can be confusing, and depending on who you talk to they might choose to focus on one element like connectivity or another. At Forrester we believe IoT extends beyond devices and connectivity.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a technical level, IoT encompasses those two elements as well analytics, sophisticated management and monitoring, and of course pervasive security to protect sensitive data and assets. But it's the business impact of IoT that truly defines what it is: the insights that you can derive with analytics and the business outcomes you can achieve.These business outcomes fall into 3 big bucketswith several use cases in each:</SPAN></P>

Capturing the promise of any of these scenarios requires organizations to collaborate in new ways.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similarly, IoT touches many analysts across Forrester, and we work together to dive deeper into how an organization can harness the potential made possible by IoT. I have the distinct pleasure of working with a group of Forrester analysts that spans our research organization and collectively works together to provide a connect body of research to help individuals across roles in organizations on their journey.</SPAN></P>

Today, buyers looking for a platform to suit their specific IoT scenario face a broad landscape of platforms that include AWS IoT, General Electric (GE) Predix, and Microsoft Azure IoT Suite, only some of which can help them.

A greater percentage of US-based companies are commercializing data as compared to European organizations. Recognizing this lag, the European Commission will issue guidelines to encourage the use of advanced technology and spark the data economy. Although the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has given companies pause, a 2018 European data economy directive will promote the exchange of data and insights.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

Security vulnerabilities are a significant worry for firms deploying IoT solutions - in fact, it's the top concern of organizations looking at deploying IoT solutions. However, most firms don't consistently mitigate IoT-specific security threats and business pressures overwhelm technology security concerns. In 2018, we'll see more IoT-related attacks like the Mirai botnet that caused havoc - except they'll grow bigger in scale and impact.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">by Chris Nolter</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">603 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As if&nbsp;cyber crime didn't give corporate boards enough to worry about,&nbsp;new regulations&nbsp;in the&nbsp;European Union kick in next year that carry stiff penalties if companies do not protect consumer data. New York passed laws governing financial companies and California and other venues are working on data&nbsp;rules.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cybersecurity has clearly graduated from an IT job to a board level concern.&nbsp;&quot;Clearly the board is responsible,&quot; said&nbsp;Hypatia Capital Managing Partner Patricia Lizarraga in a cyber security panel at The Deal Economy conference in New York. While boards are not responsible for monitoring security on the micro level, they have to monitor and support policies that govern security throughout a company.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Duties could fall to a board's audit or&nbsp;risk committee,&nbsp;Judith Germano, senior fellow at New York University's Center for Cybersecurity, said. &quot;It depends on the board, the composition of the board and the specific members,&quot; she said. The board needs quarterly updates, she said, and senior management needs to know when to bring a security issue to the board's attention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Verizon Communications Inc.'s (VZ) $4.48 billion purchase of Yahoo! Inc.'s operating business illustrates the complications that can arise during an acquisition. Verizon shaved $350 million off the price tag after the Internet group announced a pair of devastating security breaches.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The deal also reflects the involvement of overseas governments in corporate dealmaking. In March, the&nbsp;Department of Justice identified two Russian security officials of taking part in the 2014 hacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ProofPoint Inc. (PFPT) CEO Gary Steele said Thursday that the threat of activity from Russia and other nations has increased. &quot;They are super active right now. &nbsp;I don't think that goes away either,&quot; Steele said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gant Redmon, program director for Cyber Security and Privacy at IBM Inc.'s (IBM) Resilient, suggested that buyers should have a list of questions ready for targets. Do they have a chief investment security officer, or CISO? Do they know where their&nbsp;data is stored and who has access to it, among other details?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Security has to extend throughout the company, Redmon noted, but establishing accountability can help move things along.&nbsp;&quot;Who is going to get fired?&quot; he&nbsp;asked.&nbsp;&quot;That really focuses people.&quot;&nbsp;The average lifespan of a CISO is 18 months, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The responsibility is not limited to the tech suite, however. Germano observed&nbsp;that Target Corp. (TGT) CEO Gregg Steinhafel resigned in 2014 following the massive security breach. &quot;Target was a sea change,&quot; she said. In addition to high-level firings, she added, boards have been sued. &quot;Everyone is on the chopping block,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chopping block is about to get a bit more severe in May when the European Union's&nbsp;&nbsp;General Data Protection Regulation hits next year. The GDPR will fine companies that do not adequately protect data&nbsp;&amp;#8364;20 million or 4% of their global annual turnover--whichever is greater.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They will be looking for a big company to make an example of,&quot;&nbsp;Germano said.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York State enacted rules this summer increasing the data-protection requirements on banks, insurance companies and other financial services firms. California is also working on data protection rules.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The regulations present a &quot;a legal maze&quot; of &quot;obligations in lots of different jurisdictions,&quot; Proofpoint's Steele said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Companies that have not prepared for GPDR's launch and the other new restrictions may find themselves in a bind, IBM's Redmon said. They can't count on the availability of advisers to help them.&nbsp;&quot;I know consulting firms that are booked through 2018,&quot; he said.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">DEAL SIZE</SPAN><BR></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) was adopted in 2016 to strengthen data protection procedures and practices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All companies established or operating in the EU must comply, causing companies to evaluate their data security standards to meet compliance by the May 25, 2018 deadline.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cyber insurers are also anticipating a shift in both coverage demand and long-term incident reporting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">New regs</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As EU and U.S. companies reevaluate their data security posture to prepare for the new regulations, and assess the hefty fines attached to GDPR laws, having a cyber insurance policy has become more attractive, says BitSight Technology's Vice President Jake Olcott.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Related: Cyber risk management a top priority as companies prepare for GDPR, study says</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a conversation with PropertyCasualty360.com, Olcott offered insight into the long-term impacts of GDPR on cyber insurers and underwriters, both in the EU and here in the U.S.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Olcott says the reason why GDPR is such a big deal is because of the fines. It will be much more expensive than existing regulations, as the maximum fine for not complying with the GDPR is #x20AC;20,000,000 (roughly $23.7 million US) or 4 percent of a company's worldwide revenue (not profit), whichever is greater.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The concern is cyber insurance policies as they are written today won't cover GDPR fines. Olcott says for carriers and brokers, the question is, &quot;What does this new regulation mean?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Coverage for fines?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It means there are a lot more companies that will be focused on cyber insurance and buying cyber insurance policies, which is great. But there is a concern that policies the way they are written today may not allow insurance companies to cover GDPR fines.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Olcott recently penned a blog post on how and why U.S. businesses should prepare for the GDPR, and in a separate write-up, provided an 8-part checklist of tasks to prepare for compliance to the pending regulation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BitSight Technology is a security ratings company that offers data analytics and security software, helping companies manage third party risk, underwrite cyber insurance policies, benchmark security performance &amp; assess aggregate risk. BitSight offers guidance on GDPR compliance with their report &quot;A Risk Manager's Guide to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Olcott says certain industry sectors are more prepared for the GDPR than others. In this Risk Manager's Guide, BitSight lists 6 ways companies can prepare for the GDPR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Related: 3 best practices for a layered cybersecurity program</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Create an in-depth plan for third-party risk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Modulate your GDPR program.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After a year marked by cyber-attacks on a large scale, 2018 will be promising for computer criminals, who will develop even more destructive tools, it said in a report released McAfee security company Wednesday. &gt; &gt; Bad Rabbit, NoptPetya, Wannacry... These three ransomware, or malicious programs, have crippled hundreds of thousands of computers around the world and filled the pockets of hackers. &gt; Wannacry, which attacked in may British health services, plants of the French Renault car manufacturer, the German railways and the Spanish Government, would have generated 140 million dollars in revenue to the extortionists. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sixty-nine percent of consumers feel businesses don't take customer data security very seriously and 70% of them said they would stop doing business with a company following a data breach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amsterdam-based digital-security firm Gemalto also revealed in report &quot;&quot;Data Breaches and Customer Loyalty 2017,&quot; customers expect businesses to protect personal data. The study based its findings on a survey of more than 10,000 consumers worldwide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Surveyed consumers in 2017 are more likely (37%) to believe that they could be a victim of a breach at any time, compared to those surveyed in 2016 (35%) and 2015 (27%). In addition, 58% believe the threat to their personal information increases during a high profile commercial events like Black Friday, Amazon Prime Day or Cyber Monday, which experience a staggering $6.59 billion in estimated sales, the largest ever online sum for a U.S. shopping day.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The majority of consumers (62%) believe businesses holding their data are mostly responsible for its security. Consequently, businesses must take additional steps to protect consumers and enforce robust security measures, as well as educate customers on the benefits of adopting these measures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When it comes to the businesses that consumers trust least, over half (58%) believe that social media sites are one of the biggest threats to their data, with one in five fearful of travel sites. On the other hand, a third of respondents trust financial institutions the most with their personal data, despite being frequent targets and victims of data breaches, with industry certified bodies (12%), device manufacturers (11%) and the government (10%) next on the list.</SPAN></P>

<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consumer respondents believe that the majority (67.79%) of responsibility falls onto companies for protecting and securing customer data, on average. Only 27% of respondents believe companies take this very seriously.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The vast majority (93%) of respondents would consider taking legal action if they were the victims of a breach.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite customer concerns, the Gemalto study found consumers are failing to adequately secure themselves, with over half (56%) still using the same password for multiple online accounts. Even when businesses offer robust security solutions, such as two-factor authentication, 41% of consumers admit to not using the technology to secure social media accounts, leaving them vulnerable to data breaches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Consumers are evidently happy to relinquish the responsibility of protecting their data to a business, but are expecting it to be kept secure without any effort on their part,&quot; Jason Hart, CTO, Identity and Data Protection at Gemalto, said. &quot;In the face of upcoming data regulations such as GDPR, it's now up to businesses to ensure they are forcing security protocols on their customers to keep data secure. It's no longer enough to offer these solutions as an option. These protocols must be mandatory from the start - otherwise businesses will face not only financial consequences, but also potentially legal action from consumers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hart continued, &quot;It's astonishing that consumers are now putting their own data at risk, by failing to use these measures, despite growing concerns around their security.&quot; He added, the result is an alarming amount of breaches, 80%, caused by weak or previously stolen credentials. Something has to change soon on both the business and consumer sides or this is only going to get worse.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a significant finding, the study said, considering that one third of organizations can't distinguish between &quot;good&quot; bots and &quot;bad&quot; ones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report, based on a global survey of more than 600 security executives from the retail, healthcare, and financial services sectors, found that nearly half (45 percent) of respondents had experienced a data breach in the last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than two thirds (68 percent) are not confident they can keep corporate information safe. In addition, companies often leave sensitive data under-protected. More than half (52 percent) do not inspect the traffic they transfer to-and-from APIs, and 56 percent do not have the ability to track data once it leaves the company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Any organization that collects information on European citizens will soon be required to meet the strict data privacy laws imposed by General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR), which take effect in May 2018.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Almost 100,000 websites, including 482 of the 50,000 most trafficked, use session replay scripts, many without clear disclosures, providing insight into user behavior but also exposing vital data to external servers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You may know that most websites have third-party analytics scripts that record which pages you visit and the searches you make,&quot; Steven Englehardt, Gunes Acar, and Arvind Narayanan, explained in the first of Princeton's &quot;No Boundaries&quot; series. &quot;But lately, more and more sites use 'session replay' scripts. These scripts record your keystrokes, mouse movements, and scrolling behavior, along with the entire contents of the pages you visit, and send them to third-party servers.&quot; The researchers suggested unlike typical analytics services that deliver aggregate statistics, these scripts provide recording and playback of individual browsing sessions, as if someone is looking over the consumer's shoulder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The study cast doubt about maintaining the anonymity of the collected data &quot;In fact, some companies allow publishers to explicitly link recordings to a user's real identity.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Princeton research pointed out collection of page content by third-party replay scripts may cause sensitive information such as medical conditions, credit card details and other personal information displayed on a page to leak to the third-party as part of the recording. &quot;This may expose users to identity theft, online scams, and other unwanted behavior. The same is true for the collection of user inputs during checkout and registration processes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The replay services offer a combination of manual and automatic redaction tools that allow publishers to exclude sensitive information from recordings. However, to avoid leaks, publishers must diligently check and scrub all pages, which display or accept user information. For dynamically generated sites, this process involves inspecting the underlying web application's server-side code. Further, this process needs repeating every time an update or a change to the site or web application takes place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">San Francisco-based digital threat management firm RiskIQ just released a follow-up blog, exploring how these scripts also put companies at risk of violating EU's General Data Protection Regulation, taking effect on May 25, 2018, and revealing its own research. Querying its data, RiskIQ uncovered that the domains of 38 of the top 50 U.S. online retailers contain session replay scripts, especially relevant as consumers take to the web for holiday shopping.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;While great for marketing purposes, using these scripts can be a big problem,&quot; Mike Browning, a manager at RiskIQ, said. On May 25, 2018, the EU's General Data Protection Regulation goes into effect, which applies to any organization that collects, stores, and uses personal information about an EU citizen. &quot;As part of the regulation's fairness and transparency guidelines, organizations must clearly state at the point of capture how they'll be using an individual's data. Permission to use their data must be explicit and demonstrated through an action such as ticking a box, a significant departure to the 'opt out' process most organizations have in place today. Evidence of violations and negligence serves as cause for significant fines.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thousands of American companies, including  credit unions, that do business with European customers need to reckon with GDPR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To support GDPR specifications, organizations need a comprehensive understanding of their digital footprint-all of the various internet-exposed assets that belong to them. They must be able to discover which external assets collect personally identifiable information, including a user's name, phone number, address, social media presence, photos, lifestyle preferences, location data, and even their IP address.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For multinational companies with expansive web infrastructure, merely compiling and assessing site details is often fraught with gaps and inaccuracies,&quot; Browning said. When looking at 25 of the 50 largest financial institutions in the U.S. (2017), the RiskIQ Threat Research team discovered that 68% had significant security gaps in PII collection.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Uber paid hackers a $100,000 ransom to destroy the data at the time of the breach, and did not tell regulators or users. Uber said it received assurances of the data's destruction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dara Khosrowshahi, the new Uber CEO, said two hackers stole company data in late 2016 including personal information such as phone numbers, email addresses, and names, of 57 million Uber users.

The decision to cover up a data breach comes from the top, and requires the buy-in of other execs, who have now paid the price. The outgoing security officer, out of a misguided sense of loyalty, must have corrupted his ethical beliefs to facilitate the poor choices made in dealing with this,&quot; Andy Norton, Redwood City, Calif.-based Lastline's Director of Threat Intelligence, held.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hopefully it will act as a warning for other companies who get extortion demands from hackers not to pay the ransom, and not cover up the breach of personally identifiable data on customers and employees,&quot; Norton advised. &quot;It appears the new CEO at Uber has proactively decided to disclose the 2016 breach, probably for the purposes of building a foundation on which to establish a solid reputation for strong governance and balanced risk management.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Norton added the disclosure arrives before the deadline of GDPR, of which this would be a poster child example. The EU's General Data Protection Regulation, slated for a May 25, 2018 rollout, changes the handling of personal and corporate data particularly in terms of PII. Norton suggested based on 2016 revenues, Uber would be looking at a 65 million dollar fine, 4% of revenue, if European customer data was in the breached database.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Morey Haber, vice president of technology at Phoenix-based BeyondTrust, stated &quot;As a security professional, I am baffled by these events and not sure how to even prioritize the things they did wrong. &quot;very business should consider these as lessons learned and not make the same mistakes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Haber listed some other concerns:</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><UL CLASS="c9"><LI CLASS="c10"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"><NOBR>&bull;</NOBR></SPAN></P>
<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The breach occurred due to a failure to secure credentials on a Github site used by engineers. Then leveraging stolen privileges hackers gained access to Amazon AWS instances that support Uber and compromised an archive file containing the data.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
</LI><LI CLASS="c10"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"><NOBR>&bull;</NOBR></SPAN></P>
<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Uber maintained no stolen information showed up in any other attacks or incidents (for now).&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
</LI><LI CLASS="c10"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"><NOBR>&bull;</NOBR></SPAN></P>
<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Uber agreed to an FTC settlement three months ago over privacy concerns, without admitting wrongdoing, and before telling the agency about the breach - thus completely misleading the government!&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Clearly, their new executive team gets it, but the former CEO and legal officers were clueless. This is just another case of privileges being used in a targeted attack, hackers demanding ransom for stolen information, and companies not being morally responsible for the stolen user data,&quot; Haber added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Forty-eight states have security breach notification laws, including California, Uber's home state. State Attorneys General from New York and Massachusetts opened investigations into the data breach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;American consumers deserve better from the companies they've entrusted with their financial information,&quot; NAFCU President and CEO Dan Berger has said about these types of breaches. &quot;Our country should already have a national data security standard in place for retailers and merchants, but we don't and it's extremely frustrating. How many more data breaches do consumers need to suffer before these companies are held accountable?&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many fintech and payment companies are not subjected to the regulatory standards applied to banks, insurance and investment management companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But May 25, 2018, the fintech industry will see the implementation of fundamentally a new global law that leaves little to no room for discretion or flexibility in implementation: the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though the new regulation is designed to protect personal data of European Union (EU) members, it also has implications for companies in other countries-especially in today's global industry. All U.S. businesses who process personal data from customers in the EU will be affected. On a national scale, consistency across the EU will reduce risks and costs for U.S. businesses; however, if regulations are not met, companies could be fined up to four percent of their annual worldwide turnover.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today's organizations need to prepare for enforced disclosure requirements, the addition of Data Protection Officers and transformed design standards. In implementing these, companies must be prepared to answer consumer's right to explanation-ranging from why a customer's data is used, to their right to have their data erased. Essentially, companies will either need to hire, or in essence become, privacy experts, in order to meet adjusted customer demand and continue global business transactions that are in compliance with regulatory standards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With data breaches making headlines, public attention has turned to disclosure regulations. To date, there is no national consistency regarding how companies are required to disclose data breaches. In the U.S., these laws vary between states, both in time given for a company to report a breach, and in how much information a company must report. 48 states currently require disclosure, to some degree, but only eight states specify timing-which varies from 15-90 days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Contrarily, the new GDPR will require companies to disclose breaches no later than 72 hours after they become aware of the situation. U.S. companies with an extended customer base in the EU will need to ensure they are consistently monitoring their data to maintain regulatory standards. This will change the dynamic for U.S. companies, but it remains to be seen is if this will spur national consistency in disclosure regulation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While many companies already have a Compliance Officer in place, the GDPR requires a Data Protection Officer (DPO). The DPO must have the same knowledge as the Compliance Officer, supplemented with the knowledge required to monitor for practices in guidelines with regulatory standards. Typically, the Compliance Officer maintains a position within a company, serving as a representative. The GDPR allows the role to be served by an employee of third-party service provider, but additionally suggests the DPO be independent of the organization to serve as an unbiased party to maintain compliance. Companies should be prepared to appoint this position and should begin accounting for the resources and training required to do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GDPR introduces the requirements of Privacy by Design and Privacy by Default, thereby altering the standards for data processing. No longer will safety measures be viewed as a supporting feature with varying degrees of protection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rather, the GDPR requires that protection be designed into the development of business processes. As high security standards become a conventional norm, it is key for companies to know that processes must be designed in a way that only handles personal data on an as needed basis. This will result in some companies undergoing a complete transformation. New processes must be able to track activity, prove consent of the customer and also process data beyond an algorithmic basis, as the GDPR allows customers to inquire and counter any practices that generate decisions from automated processing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Businesses will not only have to make shifts for customer consent, but customers' and clients' expectations. The GDPR will result in increased demand for end clients to automate and control the use of their personally identifiable information (PII) with counterparties or vendors for future marketing purposes. This would impact and could potentially limit the vendors' ability to market to those end clients who have taken charge of their PII. This would have a significant impact on digital marketing as we know it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GDPR will result in increased demand for both personal data and data protection expertise. As the GDPR is implemented within the EU, the U.S. companies that not only prepare for compliance, but also successfully offer services that help other companies prepare for the regulation, can pioneer global business in its transformation stage.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">John C. Eustice</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vol. 1</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">No. 1</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1051  words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On April 14, 2016, the European Parliament adopted the General Data Protection Regulation, and GDPR will go into full effect in approximately six months. According to numerous recent studies, a majority of firms are not ready to meet compliance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The stated goal of the GDPR is to harmonize data privacy and security laws across Europe, protect and empower the privacy of all EU citizens, and ensure that organizations across the EU approach data privacy and security in the same manner. The GDPR applies to and imposes compliance obligations upon all companies that control or process the personal data of EU citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Data controller&quot; is defined broadly, including any individual or entity that gathers personal data for processing. The definition of &quot;data processor&quot; is similarly broad, encompassing any individual or body that processes personal data on behalf of the controller. It is important to note that the GDPR applies to data controllers and processors outside the EU that offer goods or services or even monitor EU citizens.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All companies that operate in the EU are likely to process at least some personal data as data controllers, if only as it relates to their employees. Certainly, organizations that gather consumer data should be focusing on compliance, while all companies should, at the least, review their data processing activities, identify all activities for which they are a data controller, implement policies and technical safeguards in accordance with GDPR guidelines, audit their current third-party data storage contracts, and set up a practical incident response plan in the event of a data breach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Data processors, including cloud service providers and other information technology vendors that process personal data, also must review their legal obligations under the GDPR, as they have independent compliance responsibility for the first time. These obligations include maintaining written documentation of processing activities carried out on behalf of a data controller, designating a data protection officer, and notifying the data controller upon discovering a data breach without undue delay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So how are companies digesting the GDPR and reviewing their internal data policies? According to a survey of 200 European-based companies by cloud security provider Alert Logic published last month, while 77 percent of the surveyed companies are familiar with the GDPR, only 5 percent believe they are compliant with all applicable requirements. Moreover, only 27 percent reported that they were confident they will be ready when the GDPR becomes enforceable in May 2018.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lack of confidence likely stems from the sheer scope of the GDPR. With 99 articles and 173 recitals, it is a massive document that, despite its goal of reducing administrative burdens for companies dealing with multiple data protection authorities within the EU, places high accountability burdens and new, regulations on data controllers and processors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many companies do not even know where to start, but companies should focus on identifying the key areas of change between the GDPR and the aged 1995 EU Data Protection Directive that it replaces. These include:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Expanded Jurisdiction and Scope</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GDPR applies to companies without a legal establishment in an EU member state provided that they control of process the personal data of EU citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stricter Requirements for Consent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GDPR makes it more difficult for companies to obtain valid consent from data subjects, stating that consent must be freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous, either by a statement or by a clear affirmative action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More Practical and User-Friendly Privacy Policies</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Article 11 of the GDPR demands &quot;transparent and easily accessible policies&quot; and communications in \xE2 oeclear and plain language&quot; adapted to the data subjects. If a controller uses automated means of gathering data, it must allow data subjects to submit choices, requests, and complaints electronically.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Restrictions on Direct Marketing and Profiling</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GDPR requires data subjects to be given the option of opting out of direct marketing, and it further requires that this opt-out be clearly distinguishable from other information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Removal of Notification Requirement, Imposition of Documentation and Accountability</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GDPR removes any requirement for a data controller to notify a data protection authority of its processing activities and replaces it with a policy of accountability, documentation, and fines for failing to meet its obligations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Principle of &quot;Privacy by Design&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GDPR includes a new principle that data controllers should design and implement processes to protect personal data, retain it only for specific (disclosed) purposes, keep it only as long as necessary, and restrict access to it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Increased Data Security</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Article 30 of the GDPR imposes technical security requirements that include the obligation to conduct risk evaluations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appointment of a Data Protection Officer</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">if the core activities of the controller and processor require regular and systematic monitoring of data subjects on a large scale or consist of processing special, sensitive categories of data, then the GDPR requires the appointment of an internal or external Data Protection Officer with sufficient expert knowledge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Keep in mind that the GDPR has significant teeth. Its tiered approach to fines empower EU member state Data Protection Authorities to impose fines of up to the higher of 4 percent of a company's annual worldwide turnover or 20 million Euros (for breaches of basic principles such as consent, breach notification, etc.), with lesser violations resulting in the imposition of fines up to the higher of 2% of annual worldwide turnover or 10 million Euros.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Overall, while the GDPR is not a drastic overhaul of data protection regulations in the European Union, it is an expansion of prior efforts to protect the data privacy rights of EU citizens that is designed to gain the attention of high-level executives and spur change at companies lagging behind in this area. While one cannot predict the speed with which member state Data Protection Authorities will levy fines for entities not in immediate compliance, demonstrating good faith efforts toward compliance is the wisest course of action for every organization doing business in the EU.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most businesses are not ready to comply with the EU's new data privacy requirements, risking prohibitive fines if they fail to meet the May deadline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Known as the General Data Protection Regulation orGDPR, the EU describes the new requirements as &quot;the most important change in data privacy regulation in 20 years.&quot; Intended to replace the current European Data Protection Directive and standardize the laws governing data privacy across the EU's member countries, it is meant to reshape the way organizations across the region deal with data privacy.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A recent survey of 132 compliance officers finds, however, that only a handful of companies are prepared to meet the new regulation's requirements. Conducted by the Compliance, Governance and Oversight Council (CGOC), a group of more than 3,600 legal and information management professionals, the global study reveals that most organizations have doubts about their data disposal practices and ability to demonstrate compliance with GDPR rules. This held true across the board, regardless of region, industry or size of the organization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Per the survey's chief findings:</SPAN></P>

<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only 6% of respondents feel their organizations are compliant with GDPR requirements, and most are concerned about their organization's poor data disposal practices and inability to demonstrate compliance.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">50% identified internal staff and practices as their organization's biggest security threat, as opposed to the 38% who view external threats as the primary danger. Poorly classified content ranked third among the respondents' security concerns.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
</LI><LI CLASS="c10"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"><NOBR>&bull;</NOBR></SPAN></P>
<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">85% agree that fine-tuning a data disposal program would improve their data protection safeguards, but 40% say their companies have yet to begin such an effort.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GDPR readiness compels companies to know the type, value and location of the information that they store and to delete, change or provide information as required by the regulations. Regular and automatic disposal of information that no longer has legal, regulatory or business value can significantly reduce the burden on information asset managers and help them remain GDPR-compliant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A comprehensive and unified governance program is one of the main pillars of GDPR readiness, because it ensures the involvement of all information stakeholders, provides a single, centralized view of all information across the enterprise and automates critical processes, such as defensible disposal,&quot; says Heidi Maher, CGOC's Executive Director.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GDPR goes into effect on May 25, 2018. Businesses found in breach of the new requirements can be fined up to 4% of their annual revenue or 20 million euros (approximately $23 million), whichever is the greater.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The General Data Protection Regulation from the European Union has been a long time coming, having passed confirmation by EU parliament in April 2016 for a start date in spring of next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roughly two years may seem like a long enough time for businesses to ramp up their data protection policies and avoid the hefty fines for non-compliance - up to 4 percent of a company's annual revenue or 20 million euro, depending on which is the higher. Yet a lot of companies are still either unprepared for the fast approaching deadline, or completely unaware that they run the risk of facing fees at all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most common misunderstanding about the regulation is that it doesn't just apply to businesses based in the European Union, or even just branch offices based on the continent. Any company that collects information on individuals living within one of the EU member states - from small e-commerce operations selling niche products to major service providers like Amazon and Google - is liable.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the GDPR itself is wide-ranging compared to the legislation it replaces, companies that have stayed up-to-date with the latest data collection best practices over the past two decades should have a good foundation in place to ramp up their policies ahead of the May 25, 2018 deadline. But there are a few significant points of consideration that companies need to waste no time in addressing as that deadline fast approaches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some companies will need to beef up staff</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the GDPR itself is a pretty cumbersome document, containing 91 articles across 11 chapters, there are a few sections in particular that will have the biggest immediate impact that businesses need to zero in on. For instance, Articles 35, 36 and 37 make it mandatory for companies collecting especially detailed personally identifiable information (PII) about EU constituents - details like genetic or biological data, health records, racial or ethnic origin and even religious preference - to appoint a data protection officer that is tasked specifically with ensuring the business complies with all GDPR mandates, and reports directly to EU authorities when breaches occur.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The legislation also dictates time frames for protection and reporting that regulators will be keeping a close eye one, especially in the wake ofrecent high-profile data breacheswhere customers weren't informed about the incidents until months or years later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Article 31, for instance, holds controllers to a 72-hour deadline to alert customers who were subject to a personal data breach. The legislation takes this a step further in Article 32, forcing controllers to notify customers immediately when breaches pose a risk of compromising a victim's rights or freedoms, or else the controller and the company could face severe litigation from EU lawmakers as well as the compromised individuals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More control is in the hands of the customers</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the GDPR is primarily intended to protect customer data, it's also going to be a great consumer tool for making sure individuals have greater choice in the companies and services they trust their data with.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Articles 17 and 18, for instance, give language to the &quot;right to portability&quot; and the &quot;right to erasure,&quot; respectively, which essentially untether specific PII from contracts that in the past have allowed businesses to stockpile data on their customers. This way, consumers can share PII with new service providers with a lower risk of violating old contractual obligations regarding data ownership, or force a business to scrub that customer's PII from their database when extenuating circumstances call for it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A regular point of reference for all members of an organization should be Article 79, which outlines what exactly qualifies as a violation of the GDPR and the associated penalties. Since few small businesses can stomach a hit of $20 million - let alone 4 percent of their annual revenue - when balancing the additional legal and logistical costs of remedying a major data breach, having in mind what to watch out for in terms of violation is critical.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are a lot of other nuances associated with the GDPR that are outlined throughout the remaining articles and chapters of the book, but businesses need to look beyond just compliance if they are going to secure their networks against data breaches that could put security teams out of a job. The threat landscape for cybersecurity is constantly evolving, and considering it took the EU almost 20 years to update their previous data protection policy, it's up to businesses to stay on top of the latest threats as they come to the fore.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Personalization works.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From ad creative tailored to a user's location, to customized product recommendations based on browsing history, today's time-scarce convenience-hungry consumers demand relevant online experiences.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four fifthsof consumers want services tailored to their interests and - as a result - effective personalization techniques can drive athreefoldincrease in consumer engagement, drastically boosting ROI.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The challenge of personalization is that it requires data, high quality data, and plenty of it. Spotify's Adam Bly recently revealed the platform's highly successful content recommendation engine is fueled by more than 100 billion user-generated data events each day. While Spotify employs the highest levels of data privacy - as emphasized by Bly - many businesses are wary of using data for personalization due to privacy fears.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a time when data privacy is a major concern - 2016 witnessed arecordnumber of data breaches - the risks of using consumer data to tailor user experiences may seem too great for the reward. And with ongoing shifts in the global privacy environment, online businesses are feeling increasingly vulnerable and confused. Many find themselves asking whether they need to pull back on personalizing the customer experience to comply with changing data protection regulations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the traditional belief that customer experience and data responsibility are mutually exclusive no longer holds true. By adopting the right approach, data can be used to deliver highly personalized and relevant messaging without intruding on user privacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An example of imminent change in the global data privacy landscape is the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which applies to any business collecting or processing data relating to EU citizens, no matter where they are located. Due to come into force in May 2018, the regulation aims to give individuals more control over their personal information. With so many US-based businesses operating across borders, compliance with the GDPR is vital. The EU-US Privacy Shield Framework - approved last year - provides a mechanism for complying with data protection requirements on both sides when data is transferred across the Atlantic from the EU.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Businesses must also be aware of state level privacy laws and how much they vary between regions. California is arguably leading the way in this area; it was thefirst stateto enact a security breach notification law. State level laws and amendments continue to change, and businesses must keep abreast of the latest developments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While these changing regulations may first appear daunting, they are not to be feared and instead should be viewed as an opportunity to build consumer trust and loyalty. By placing data protection as a top priority, fully complying with the new regulations, and communicating data practices clearly and transparently, digital businesses can demonstrate how seriously they take customer privacy rights and as a result, enhance the overall user experience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Entering into an open dialogue about the types of data collected, the purpose of data processing, and the benefits consumers receive as a result can only strengthen relationships, and businesses can use this opportunity to reassure consumers their data is protected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an increasingly crowded marketplace, personalized experiences are essential to cut through the noise and engage consumers, so online businesses must not sacrifice this competitive advantage to comply with data privacy laws. By seeing new data regulations as an opportunity to strengthen customer relationships, and ensuring all data runs through a central hub, digital businesses can embrace personalization with confidence it will enhance - rather than damage - the customer experience.</SPAN></P>

</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Companies that store data in the cloud will experience stronger restrictions relating to how they access and use information under the new regulation. EU residents, on the other hand, will gain several rights concerning personal data. Outlined below are six GDPR changes:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Personal Data Definition is Stricter</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Personal data is a broad term that covers various types of information. For instance, a firm would be holding personal facts by monitoring and storing the IP address of an individual. After the introduction of General Data Protection Regulation, companies must define the type of personal details they gather and store.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Data Minimization Principles</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GDPR requires international firms to collect data of all sizes and store it for the shortest time possible in their systems. Once the personal statistics have served its purpose, the company should delete or remove it as quickly as they can to free the space. These provisions are specifically relevant to promotional units that typically collect and store large volumes of client data to support the targeting and outreach efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Enhanced Individuals' Rights</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the regulation, persons will enjoy more privileges regarding their data, including:</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><UL CLASS="c9"><LI CLASS="c10"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"><NOBR>&bull;</NOBR></SPAN></P>

<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The civil rights to &quot;~data portability'- Gives you the mandate to download any stored personal details in a readable format from any machine. You can request sharing of your personal information with other organizations.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You can even ask for correction of wrong data.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Data Breach Notification</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">General Data Protection Regulation requires worldwide firms to report data breach issues to the appropriate authorities within three days of the incident. The company should analyze the information promptly and monitor it closely when reporting to the relevant unit. Authorities need the details to help affected departments mitigate the risks linked to the breaching of the personal statistic. Attacks on individual information are common, even to the global organizations. It is therefore critical for the entity to develop an official plan to assist in addressing the condition. Cyber- attacks are a threat to company information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Increased Accountability</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GDPR contains various governance rules. The regulation highlights the terms an organization should follow when appointing a Data Protection Officer (DPO). The DPO conducts routine privacy assessments for their company to determine the effect of the new application. They also alert the relevant officials and any victim experiencing data breaching.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Stricter Consent Procedures</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new rule demands global organizations to obtain informed and explicit consent from persons before they store or process their information. Additionally, they should not assume consent. If one fails to respond to certain questions, the action cannot be termed as consent. All questions from a company to an individual asking them to grant the organization permission to collect, process, and store personal details ought to be presented clearly. (https://iapp.org/news/a/top-10-operational-impacts-of-the-gdpr-part-1-data-security-and-breach-notification/#). Furthermore, once acquired, consent must be stored within the entity for future reference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">General Data Protection Regulation aims at safeguarding personal information. The legal framework will start operating from 25 May 2018. Global firms have limited time to acquire appropriate technological measures. Failure to meet the compliance needs, the organization will incur the non-compliance cost. The new regulation applies to every entity that monitors or processes personal information of EU citizens across the universe.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This should serve as an industrywide wake-up call, for the impacts of data breaches cannot be underestimated.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The average consolidated cost of a breach is $4 million, and this will undoubtedly increase for European retailers when GDPR comes into force, where fines can total up to \xE2,\xAC20 million or 4% of total annual turnover, according toSecurityIntelligence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The long-term reputational impact must also be considered. Consumers rank data breaches as one of the most damaging factors to a brand, on the same level with environmental disasters, according toDark Reading. Consequently, 19% of consumers avoid retailers that have been hit by a major breach, according toInnovative Retail Technologies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The good news is that retailers are being proactive and looking to take control of their payments activity. Of the 80% of retailers entering payments, 40% cited security considerations as the main driver, reportsOvum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As retailers look to bring payments in-house, there are various approaches to consider. Deploying a digital wallet, however, may not be an immediately apparent option.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is perhaps because the value of mobile wallets may be seen in the ability to provide a seamless andenhanced buying experience to consumers. But digital retail wallets are also a highly-effective means of improving payments security and mitigating risk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tokenization technology is a key component to a truly secure digital retail wallet.Payment tokenizationreplaces a customer's primary account number (PAN) with a unique payment token that is restricted in its usage, for example, to a specific device, merchant, transaction type or channel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This means tokenization can help tosecure in-store transactions made via mobile walletsacross differing payment technologies, such as NFC, QR Codes or BLE. It also reduces the risk and impact of card-on-file fraud using stored credentials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For many retailers, however, the distinction between in-store and e-commerce and m-commerce has become blurred. For example, a consumer may choose to shop in store, but checkout through an in-app payment within their mobile wallet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response to changing consumer behaviors and trends, EMVCo has releasedversion two of its tokenization specificationto address emerging use-cases and ensure a secure remote payments environment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is undoubtedly good news for retailers, as it will further enhance mobile wallet security by bringing the fraud prevention capabilities of dynamic tokens to increasingly popular checkout options, such as in-app and online payments, and recurring one-click-ordering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to tokenization, various other technologies and protocols can be incorporated into digital retail wallets to provide additional security protections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biometric authentication, for example, provides an extra, visible layer of security and can be deployed in parallel with other authentication protocols such as passcodes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For hardware-grade security,secure elementsand trusted execution environments isolate data and applications from the operating system. And on an application level, code obfuscation andwhite box cryptographic techniqueshide or obscure sensitive code, data and algorithms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is clear that digital wallets that leverage tokenization are an effective means of ensuring secure retail payments, enabling retailers to adopt a modular, layered approach that is tailored to their own requirements and, importantly, strikes the right balance between security and convenience.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) formally takes effect in May 2018. The move from the current Data Protection Directive to the GDPR brings with it a whole series of new requirements forcing prudent companies to conduct assessments to identify compliance gaps. Among the key components are the requirements to implement data protection policies, conduct data protection impact assessments and appoint data protection officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When viewed along with all of the other changes, it is clear that the GDPR creates a fundamental shift away from simple protection and transparency toward a need to actively manage and control data. This increased accountability for data practices means that most companies will need to make a number of operational changes to meet the new requirements.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, businesses will need to significantly enhance their record-keeping activities. Under the current directive, companies who control personally identifiable information are often required to notify their local regulators of their data collection and processing activities. However, each EU member state currently has different notification requirements, which makes compliance particularly difficult for multinational companies or for those that hold data from citizens of multiple member states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under GDPR, it will no longer be necessary to submit data processing or transfer notifications or registrations to each relevant regulator, nor will it be a requirement to obtain approval for certain transfers. Instead, there is now an internal record-keeping requirement for all data collection, processing and transfers. The data protection authorities have also reserved their right to audit these activities and the corresponding records. The failure to document has strict penalties for noncompliance. To avoid running afoul, companies will have to start tracking and documenting all of their data gathering and processing activities, both new and existing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GDPR's mandatory breach notification requirements are another significant area of change. Data controllers must provide notice within 72 hours of having become aware of any breach that is likely to &quot;result in a risk for the rights and freedoms of individuals.&quot; Data processors will also be required to notify controllers &quot;without undue delay&quot; after first becoming aware of a data breach. Given that it can often take weeks or even months to determine exactly what data was accessed in a data breach, these timelines are quite short. Unless companies fully understand their data holdings before a breach incident occurs, they are not likely to meet them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To address both changes, the most important thing companies can do right now is data mapping. They must spend the time to fully understand exactly what personal information they collect, manage and process, from whom, for what purposes, and where and how it is being used and shared. If they are unable to do this, they cannot even begin to understand their level of compliance and what they need to do to close any gaps. This exercise should also look at international data flows and seek to understand what the legal basis is for legitimizing the transfers. It should also map out all of the service providers who are processing data on the company's behalf and ensure that the proper contractual protections are in place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Companies need to get moving, however, and not wait until it is too late. Changes to internal business processes and workflows take time to design and implement. If you are not already working on them, you may not meet the looming deadline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thankfully, there are a number of technology solutions that can help expedite the process. For example, there are several tools that can crawl across repositories of unstructured data looking for personally identifiable information and other controlled data in order to build data maps and remediation plans. They typically deploy a combination of pattern matching and conceptual search algorithms to home in on the many various types of protected information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Automated contract review tools can also be a considerable help. They deploy artificial intelligence and machine learning to automate the review of variations in customer and vendor contract clauses, such as confidentiality, data protection obligations, intended uses, legitimate bases for transfer or processing and subcontractor obligations. When combined with traditional data-mapping techniques, these technologies can significantly reduce the time needed for companies to fully understand and document their data flows to meet their compliance obligations. It does not have to be a manual process, and you don't have to do it alone.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In May 2018, the European Union will implement the new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and companies are making major policy changes to prepare for its installment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In what Marsh calls &quot;the most significant overhaul of privacy law in a generation,&quot; the GDPR will bring enormous changes to Europe's data protection and privacy rules. The regulation establishes global requirements about how organizations that do business in the European Union must manage and protect personal data, while strengthening the privacy rights of residents throughout the EU.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In anticipation of the new regulation, Marsh has released the results and analysis of a recent survey in a  new report, titled &quot;GDPR Preparedness: An Indicator of Cyber Risk Management.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Correlation between GDPR and cyber risk</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new study says the upcoming implementation of the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has elevated cyber risk to the top of the corporate agenda for organizations doing business in Europe. From the results of the survey, the report concludes that cyber risk management is both a cause and consequence of GDPR compliance, as the rules encourage businesses to adopt more rigid data protection practices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The international survey polled over 1,300 senior executives whose organizations offer products or services in the EU; 65% of respondents said they now consider cyber a top risk. That number has roughly doubled in the last year, as only 32% of respondents rated cyber as a top five risk in a similar Marsh survey conducted in 2016.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some are acting in response to the growing threat, as 23% of GDPR-impacted organizations say they were subject to a successful cyber attack in the past year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The imminent implementation of the GDPR is spurring firms to take a fresh look at their cyber risk, not just their privacy protocols,&quot; said John Drzik, president of Global Risk &amp; Digital at Marsh. &quot;This survey indicates that the most prepared firms are using GDPR as a catalyst to enhance their cyber risk management, including a more economic evaluation of their risks and an increased focus on building resilience in the face of an inevitable cyber incident.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Gearing Up</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The positive effects of the GDPR are already making themselves evident. The &quot;GDPR Preparedness&quot; report says organizations' preparation alone is creating a strong focus on expanding data protection and privacy issues, prompting related investments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of the organizations with plans for GDPR implementation, 78% plan to increase spending on cyber risk management over the next 12 months, including spending on cyber insurance. Among companies without a plan for GDPR, 52% also say they plan to increase spending on cyber risk management.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marsh surveyors asked respondents about the different cyber risk security measures their organizations have invested in or adopted in the last 12 to 24 months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among organizations compliant or developing a GDPR plan, here are the most popular cyber risk management measures adopted in the last 12 to 24 months:</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From this question, Marsh data researchers concluded that the cyber risk management activities with the highest levels of participation were cyber security measures focused on defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, this question (along with others) highlighted how a large portion of companies are not yet prepared for the GDPR to be enacted in May, or currently have no plans to comply to the new regulations. This analysis posed further questions about the effects and challenges this may create for those companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Given the effort needed to comply, organizations that have yet to make plans are likely to face challenges to meet all the requirements when GDPR takes effect in May 2018,&quot; says Thomas Reagan, Marsh's U.S. Cyber Practice leader. &quot;Focusing leadership attention on complying with GDPR is critical. Increased management attention on this issue can also be leveraged to strengthen a firm's overall cyber risk management, broadening a regulatory compliance effort into a source of cybersecurity resilience.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an increasingly breach-shy, but connected world, 90% of consumers lack confidence in Internet of Things security; and some two-thirds of consumers and almost 80% of organizations support government-set IoT guidelines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amsterdam-based digital-security firm Gemalto revealed in a report, &quot;The State of IoT Security&quot; that both consumers and businesses have serious concerns around IoT security and little confidence that IoT service providers and device manufacturers can protect IoT devices and more importantly the integrity of the data created, stored and transmitted by these devices.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;With legislation like GDPR showing that governments are beginning to recognize the threats and long-lasting damage cyberattacks can have on everyday lives, they now need to step up when it comes to IoT security. Until there is confidence in IoT amongst businesses and consumers, it won't see mainstream adoption,&quot; Jason Hart, CTO, Data Protection at Gemalto said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Key Findings:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&middot; Most organizations (96%) and consumers (90%) believe there is a need for IoT security regulations, and want government involvement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&middot; A hacker controlling IoT devices is the most common concern for consumers (65%), while six in ten (60%) worry about theft of their data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&middot; More than two-thirds (67%) of businesses encrypt all data captured or stored via IoT devices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consumers' main fear (cited by two thirds of respondents) is hackers taking control of their device. this was more concerning than leaked data (60%) and hackers accessing their personal information (54%). Despite 54% of consumers owning an IoT device (on average two), just 14% believe that they are extremely knowledgeable when it comes to the security of these devices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In terms of the level of investment in security, the survey found that IoT device manufacturers and service providers spend just 11% of their IoT budget on securing their IoT devices. The study found that these companies do recognize the importance of protecting devices and the data they generate or transfer with 50% of companies adopting a security by design approach. Two-thirds of organizations report encryption as their main method of securing IoT assets with 62% encrypting the data as soon as it reaches their IoT device, while 59% as it leaves the device. Ninety two percent of companies also see an increase in sales or product usage after implementing IoT security measures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the survey, businesses favor regulations to make it clear who is responsible for securing IoT devices and data at each stage of its journey (61%) and the implications of non-compliance (55%). Almost every organization (96%) and consumer (90%) is looking for government-enforced IoT security regulation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Businesses are realizing they need support in understanding IoT technology and are turning to partners to help, with cloud service providers (52%) and IoT service providers (50%) the favored options. When asked why, the top reason was a lack of expertise and skills (47%), followed by help in facilitating and speeding up their IoT deployment (46%).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While these partnerships may benefit businesses in adopting IoT, organizations admitted they don't have complete control over the data that IoT products or services collect as it moves from partner to partner, potentially leaving it unprotected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The lack of knowledge among both the business and consumer worlds is quite worrying and it's leading to gaps in the IoT ecosystem that hackers will exploit,&quot; Hart continued. &quot;Within this ecosystem, there are four groups involved - consumers, manufacturers, cloud service providers and third parties - all of which have a responsibility to protect the data. 'Security by design' is the most effective approach to mitigate against a breach. Furthermore, IoT devices are a portal to the wider network and failing to protect them is like leaving your door wide open for hackers to walk in. Until both sides increase their knowledge of how to protect themselves and adopt industry standard approaches, IoT will continue to be a treasure trove of opportunity for hackers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In other news Gemalto and hardware wallet provider Ledger are pooling their efforts to create a new secure storage solution for financial institutions working with cryptocurrency. The new partnership will apply Ledger's hardware wallet operating system, BOLOS, with Gemalto's cryptographic key storage system to create a device geared towards the management of crypto-assets.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the General Data Protection Regulation becoming effective May 25, 2018, organizations (or rather, organisations) seem to be stressing a bit. Most we speak with are asking, &quot;where do we even start?&quot; or &quot;what is included as personal data under the GDPR?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is safe to say that these are exactly the questions organizations should be asking, but to know where to start, organizations first need to understand how the GDPR applies to their organization within this new definition for personal data. Without first understanding what to look for, an organization cannot begin to perform data discovery and data mapping exercises, review data management practices and prepare the organization for compliance with the GDPR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Personal data redefined&quot;sort of.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To start - is personal data redefined by the GDPR? Yes. Is it more encompassing of a definition? Yes. Does it provide a good amount of guidance on interpretation of said definition? In some areas, but not in others.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Articles of the GDPR open with a list of definitions in Article 4 that provide some guidance on how to digest the remainder of the regulation-the recitals also contain some nuggets of wisdom if you have time to review. Personal data is the very first definition listed under Article 4, hinting that it is most likely pertinent to a comprehensive understanding of the regulation. Article 4(1) states:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;~Personal data' means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (&quot;~data subject'); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In breaking down this definition, there are a few key phrases to focus on. Any information is the big one, as it confirms that personal data, under this regulation, is not limited to a particular group or type of data. Relating to specifies that personal data can encompass any group or type of data, as long as the data is tied to or related to something else. What is that something else? A natural person. A natural person is just that-an actual human being to whom the data applies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You may have noticed I skipped the &quot;~an identified or identifiable' portion of the definition-identified or identifiable means that the natural person has either already been identified, or can readily be identified utilizing other available information. Article 4(1) adds further clarity here, stating that an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fact that name, identification number, location data and online identifier are specifically referenced at the beginning of this definition is important, as those pieces of data serve to directly identify an individual. If that specific data is held by the organization, all related data is in scope.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, if those unique identifiers are not held, your organization should reference the list of other data that could otherwise identify the natural person and bring everything into scope. For example, you may not have John Smith's name in your database, but you may have salary, company name, and city that that point directly to John Smith when linked together.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to the new definition of personal data, the GDPR also adds some more specificity around what it deems &quot;special categories&quot; of personal data. Article 9 1. states: processing of personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade-union membership, and the processing of genetic data, biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or data concerning a natural person's sex life or sexual orientation shall be prohibited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This definition is important, as this states that certain personal data falls into a subcategory that has stricter processing requirements. Although the requirement above states that processing of special categories of personal data is prohibited, it is important to note that there are exceptions to this rule. Organizations should reference Article 9 if they believe special categories of data to be in scope.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So how does this definition differ from previous definitions of personal data?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even though the GDPR &quot;redefines&quot; personal data, is it really all that different from existing definitions? As a baseline, let's refer to two of the more commonly used definitions for personal data taken from the GDPR's predecessor-the Data Protection Directive-and NIST 800-122.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Data Protection Directive defines personal data in Article 2 (a), which states &quot;~personal data &quot;~ shall mean any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (&quot;~data subject'); an identifiable person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identification number or to one or more factors specific to his physical, physiological, mental, economic, cultural or social identity. This definition is almost identical to that of the GDPR. The main difference is that the GDPR added additional data that can identify an individual, such as name, location data and online identifier. By adding these into the mix, the GDPR is clarifying where individuals are presumed to be identified, helping organizations understand that the data associated with those identifiers is in scope and covered under the regulation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Special categories of personal data is also defined under the Data Protection Directive. Article 8 1. states Member States shall prohibit the processing of personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade-union membership, and the processing of data concerning health or sex life. The GDPR expanded on this definition as well, now including genetic and biometric data, as well as sexual orientation data to be included in special categories. Essentially, the GDPR has taken the definitions for both personal data and special categories from the Data Protection Directive and provided more clarity, while making them more inclusive at the same time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most people probably expect the Data Protection Directive and GDPR to have similar definitions, as they are essentially version 1 and 2 of modern day EU data privacy legislation, respectively. However, when compared to the definition of personal data contained in U.S.-based guidance, we start to see some key differences. As the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is widely accepted, let's look at their definition of personal data found in their Guide to Protecting the Confidentiality of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) from 2010. NIST 800-122, Section 2.1 states PII is - any information about an individual maintained by an agency, including (1) any information that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual&quot;~s identity, such as name, social security number, date and place of birth, mother&quot;~s maiden name, or biometric records; and (2) any other information that is linked or linkable to an individual, such as medical, educational, financial, and employment information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In breaking down this NIST definition, we see some similarities, in that the NIST definition starts off just as broadly with the phrasing &quot;any information.&quot; In the same vein, the wording &quot;about an individual&quot; speaks to the clarification provided in the GDPR definition as well. That being said, the definition then goes on to add more specifics regarding information that can identify or be linked to an individual, which is where we start to notice some differences. The identifying pieces of information listed in the NIST definition includes name, social security number, date and place of birth, mother's maiden name or biometric records. The GDPR is a bit more inclusive in its definition, including name, identification number, location data, and online identifier, which covers most of the items from the NIST definition but also adds the online portion as well. While the GDPR doesn't include the biometric data in the main definition, it does cover physical and genetic information in the other related information listing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These differences don't stop there. The NIST definition does go on to provide guidance on other information that could be linked to the individual, but instead of listing out specific data, the definition focuses rather on sectoral categories of data that seem to be derived from the sectoral privacy laws in the United States. The GDPR definition does not follow this pattern, and instead focuses on the different data that can be linked to an individual from a more generic standpoint, listing out the pieces of information that could be tied to an individual in most industries. Also, while the GDPR definition states that one or more of those other data elements can also identify the individual, the NIST definition really brings that other information into scope by saying it can be personal data as long as the individual is identified-though it does not state that the information can also be used to identify an otherwise unidentified individual.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Final Thoughts</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the GDPR's becoming effective next year, it's clear that this new definition of personal data expands on the preexisting EU definition of personal data contained in the Data Protection Directive. Additionally, it adds more specificity to the data that can be used to identify an individual in comparison with leading US personal data definitions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why is this so important and relevant to organizations? This new definition of personal data is the most comprehensive definition to date, bringing into scope more information to be considered than any previous definitions in industry regulations or standards. Now, organizations will need to take another look at their previous determination of personal data and reevaluate their data management practices to ensure that the information they hold has been labeled and handled correctly. In fact, information deemed not applicable to past privacy regulations and standards may now become relevant when taking the new definition of personal data into consideration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Look no further than IP addresses. Most companies wouldn't normally lump in IP addresses with personal data, but the now-effective GDPR specifically calls out online identifiers in the definition of personal data. The Court of Justice for the European Union (CJEU) issued its judgement indicating as such in Case C-582/14: Patrick Breyer v Bundesrepublik Deutschland, setting precedent that even dynamic IP addresses can be considered personal data in certain situations. Given this new standard, it will be important for organizations to incorporate judgements from recent cases and guidance from the Article 29 Working Party (being replaced by the European Data Protection Board in May of 2018) when determining how the GDPR impacts to their organization and how best to comply.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New procedures and criteria can be confusing, but hopefully the information above has provided some clarity around this new definition of personal data that the GDPR will introduce next year. Basic knowledge of these definitions can be a starting point for determining how the GDPR applies to your organization, and if approached from a comprehensive data and risk management standpoint, this information can help better prepare your organization for compliance with the GDPR and other future privacy regulations and frameworks.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before you know it May 25, 2018 will be here and theGeneral Data Protection Regulation, the European Union's new omnibus data privacy and information security law, will be in full effect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No one wants to be on the hook for the steep penalties that await organizations found in violation of GDPR's mandates. Therefore, companies have been spending millions of dollars and thousands of hours preparing for nearly two years since GDPR was announced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course the big question is: have those resources been allocated wisely? Will the investments in GDPR compliance prove to be well spent when May 25 arrives? If arecent survey by tech firm Veritasis any indication, the answer may be a resounding, &quot;No!&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the Veritas report, only 31 percent of companies surveyed believe they are GDPR compliant. That percentage is concerning enough, but even worse, the number may actually be closer to 2 percent. How could there be such a readiness gap? What about all that preparation? Was it squandered? Probably not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A primary challenge with any major regulation is that, no matter how meticulous its writers intended to be, there will always be ambiguity. Some of that ambiguity is intentional and some simply unavoidable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GDPR was necessitated because the old regulation dictating the security and management of data, 1995's Data Protection Directive, was obsolete. Twenty years of technological evolution and innovation-the best and the worst-resulted in a major shift in how data is created, moved, stored and protected. The Data Protection Directive could not keep up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A lot of very talented lawyers, advocates and technologists spent a long time writing the document designed to address and balance the needs of people and businesses. However, not every possible situation can be accounted for in a single regulation, nor can the future be accurately predicted. Some vagueness is inevitable-and necessary. Whether by design or oversight, many conditions and definitions contained in GDPR will be subject to legal challenges and that process will set the precedents needed to clarify the regulations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another factor in the uncertainty over readiness comes from the steady stream of news about major data security failures. Even the most confident CISO can't help but read about all the data breaches, ransomware campaigns and other cybercrime. Events such asEquifax,Avast/CCleaner,WannaCry,NotPetyaandDynprovoke concerns about vulnerabilities that might not have been accounted for. In the first half of 2017 alone, nearly2 billion records were exposedthanks to hackers. What if any events like these happened after GDPR is in effect? If a breach affects EU citizen data there's a good chance the European Commission will act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even a number of legal experts and respected privacy and security professionals deeply involved in GDPR compliance efforts can't guarantee that any organization victimized by ransomware would NOT be found in violation of the upcoming regulation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You see, the conditions surrounding a ransomware infection might not expose private data in the traditional sense. Then again, the European Commission might decide to prosecute under GDPR if they felt security systems and processes were exposed as being insufficient.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some experts have even said that, following the WannaCry and NotPetya campaigns, there has been a sharp increase in calls from clients and other organizations concerned about that very question. In these cases, some cite a well-established U.S. data breach regulation,California's data breach law, SB 1386, to illustrate the challenge of predicting how GDPR might come into play.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under SB 1386, noncompliance is defined as &quot;unauthorized acquisition of computerized data that compromises the security, confidentiality, or integrity of personal information maintained by the person or business.&quot; While a NotPetya infection didn't seem to meet that standard, there's no way to really say. And a specific company may be bound not only by the regulation, but also by their own contractual obligations to the customer. In other words, until May 25, 2018, organizations can only deal with hypotheticals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is worth noting that the definition of a data breach under GDPR is much broader than in the U.S. In Europe, data is considered breached if &quot;accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to, personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed&quot; occurs. That sets a far lower threshold than in the U.S. and so an event like a ransomware infection may put an organization at risk of action by the Commission even if U.S. law is not violated. That means that until next year, even the most rigorous compliance efforts must accept a certain amount of uncertainty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Depending on available resources and willingness to accept a certain amount of risk, some aspects of implementing a compliance program may have to wait until after precedent has been set and clarity is further established.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's not a reassuring thought, but there is some comfort in knowing that the Commission has signaled that only egregious cases of negligence leading to a data breach are likely to be prosecuted aggressively. They recognize that no level of security can provide absolute protection. At least early in the process, honest mistakes are unlikely to be punished to the full extent of the law. Of course, that will be cold comfort for the organization with the ignominious distinction of being the first violator to be prosecuted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given the questions and uncertainties that are swirling around GDPR compliance today, I wonder if Veritas's figure of a 2 percent rate of compliance isn't overly optimistic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Data security compliance is-and always will be-a moving target, and that is never as true as in the period before a regulation goes into effect. That is no excuse for complacency; it simply means that responsible organizations should do what they can in advance of GDPR to prepare-and remain vigilant after May 25, 2018 to ensure the security and integrity of the data that has been entrusted to them remains intact.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The European Union has long considered that a person owns all non-public data about him or her. Each individual then explicitly grants and revokes rights to process (for example: collect, analyze, aggregate and store) his or her personal data to everyone interested.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With some data, it is easy. One signs a contract, and later on, perhaps cancels the contract, along with permissions to process the data. But the question is not only about granting or revocation of rights to process, but also about getting to know which data is stored, how it was processed, with whom it was shared, and having the possibility to remove that data from systems (i.e., to be forgotten).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Data in the physical world leave some traces, and even more in the digital world. Each of our digital activities touches many systems: computers, servers, information systems, transmission systems, security systems, usage analysis systems, and so on. Moreover, not all of these traces are under contractual relationships due to complexity of interaction between systems, as well as due to usability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Information systems and the Internet were designed mostly respecting another model - that the owner of the system owns the data as well, unless it is specifically provisioned otherwise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) threatens everyone globally that processes data of clients and EU residents with big fines if the EU approach of data owning is not respected. ISACA recently issued a new publicationGDPR Data Protection Impact Assessments - What Does It Mean to Me, providing guidance to practitioners and their organizations for how to deal with these considerations.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Glancing over my email inbox the last month or so, one thing is clear: A lot of tech companies are updating their terms of service and/or their privacy policy and letting us, the users, know about it.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's not just social media companies such as Facebook and Twitter, which have been tweaking their terms of late, but ones such as Roku, Fitbit and e-commerce firms - pretty much any tech company that collects data on you for whatever reason.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reason for so many updates and notifications lately is most likely connected to European data-protection rules set to go into effect May 25. The General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, is meant to require companies to be more transparent about their data policies and to give customers more control over that and ways to opt out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are some doubts, however, as to whether this will actually clamp down on privacy problems, or simply give an advantage to our largest tech firms by making it less likely people will allow less well-known companies the same kind of access to their private information than they already allow the Googles and Facebooks of the world.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Artificial intelligence is becoming a competitive advantage that will force institutions to incorporate it, according to participants at the BankAI conference this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People will have to adopt artificial intelligence,&quot; said Brian Pearce, senior vice president of artificial intelligence at Wells Fargo. &quot;It will have to become part of everyone's set of tools.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He isn't the only consumer banking executive who sees AI as a major factor in future survival.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have to keep up and we have to stay ahead,&quot; said Diane Morais, president of consumer and commercial banking products at Ally Bank.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But if one other thing was also clear at the conference, it was this: The road ahead is not going to be easy. Following is a guide to what banks are doing now and how it may evolve:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What banks are doing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wells Fargo is piloting several chatbot technologies, though it has yet to suggest a launch date for any of them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Pearce propounded an interesting use case for chatbots that hasn't been discussed before: bereavement assistance bots for bankers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Imagine someone close to you has passed away, maybe it's a parent or sibling, and you've been named the executor of their estate,&quot; Pearce said. &quot;You're sad, you're grieving, and you now have this messy financial situation to go through. And you're going to call us and you want to talk about handling the deceased person's estate. This is a terrible, terrible use case for a chatbot. You need a human here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bank has a team dedicated to bereavement - they take these phone calls and help executors manage the estates of the newly deceased.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You have a very emotional customer on the phone, and a very complicated set of laws and procedures,&quot; Pearce said. &quot;Unfortunately, the better the customer was, the more complicated it is. With 82 lines of business, you might have a lot of relationships with us - credit card, checking account, mortgage account, savings account, personal loan, car loan and so on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bank's new chatbot will let the customer service representative, who is on the phone being empathetic, ask questions of a knowledge-filled chatbot, like, &quot;In the state of California, what's the procedure for transferring a checking account to an estate?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wells is also working on a virtual assistant that will provide financial advice and recommendations to customers. And it plans to use AI to streamline operations, through the use of bots that &quot;do the boring stuff for us,&quot; Pearce said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bank of America</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michelle Moore, head of digital banking at Bank of America, shared an update on the virtual assistant it announced a year ago, erica. It's now in use by 300 employees. Sixty percent of the time, employees choose to interact with erica by voice, though they could also use chat, Moore said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Naming a chatbot is not as easy as it seems, she said - erica was one of the last names the bank considered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We were trying to think of one-syllable and two-syllable names, how to make it fast and easy,&quot; she said. &quot;We knew we wanted it to tie to our heritage so we were thinking of the name of the founder of Bank of America.&quot; Variations on that name were trademarked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bank's agency put erica, a play on the bank's name, to music and gave it a personality, and Moore's team was sold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It turns out that erica is a girl, after all. The bank has been insisting for the past year that erica was not female. But Moore said, &quot;It's kind of hard not to refer to her as a her versus an it because there is some personality to it. As you saw, when I said thank you, she said, 'my pleasure.' I prefer to refer to her as her.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It seems that erica is being created to be a professional - she's pleasant, polite and has a profanity filter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;erica won't be perfect - neither were Siri or Google Home at first - but she will be pretty darned good,&quot; Moore said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bank of America is using AI in many other areas, too, Moore shared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It will strengthen decisions around underwriting, fraud analytics and risk analytics,&quot; she said. &quot;Everything we use data for to make decisions - how do we automate that and turn it into a better experience for customers?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ally Bank</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ally Bank was one of the first to launch an AI-based virtual assistant two years ago: Ally Assist, which is based on technology from Personetics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ally Assist already provides a contextualized user experience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Consumers have the ability to speak or text questions, then based on how they interact with Ally Assist, the content is customized when they come back next time,&quot; Morais said. &quot;So if you're always checking your balances, always asking to see what your last five debit card transactions were, that content will be served up for you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most people who commonly interact with Ally Assist are heavier transaction customers, Morais said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're checking on their money a lot, they want to know where they stand, they want to be in control,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ally has also been testing an Alexa Skill for use with Amazon's Echo devices for a few weeks. It developed a special feature for Alexa called CurrenSee that tells the user how long they'd have to work to afford something they want to buy, like a smartphone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bank is also using AI in the back office. For instance, the bank used robotic process automation to streamline an exception process that had required back-office staff to navigate multiple screens and type hundreds of keystrokes. It now takes three clicks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The exception process team manager literally cried,&quot; Morais said. &quot;The team was so much happier doing things to actually help customers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To help confront identity theft, the bank partnered with UK company Featurespace, which provides AI-based behavioral analytics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The startup and the bank created what they call a deposit risk engine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've been able to ingest millions of data records, including transactional information, from our data lake, and put on top of that the tools and self-learning models,&quot; Morais said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fraud detection rates have gone up and security alerts have dropped, she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BBVA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Robert Sears, executive vice president and global head of product for new digital businesses at BBVA, said the bank is applying AI in credit decisions and focusing on explainability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You can't introduce models you can't explain,&quot; he said. &quot;Under the U.S. regulators and European regulations like GDPR, you have to explain how a model makes decisions. So as we build out the model, we're building out the tools for interpretability.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bank also plans to use AI to prevent fraud in account opening and to improve user experience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How banks see the future</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By late summer of next year, the help button in Bank of America's mobile app, as well as its interactive voice response system, will be replaced by erica.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the future, Moore sees erica working with Alexa, Siri and Google.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At Ally Bank, integration with digital speakers beyond Amazon Echo is in the plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We started with Alexa, and we believe in test, learn, apply,&quot; Morais said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pearce sees AI transforming mobile banking interfaces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That chat interface lets you really rethink navigation and rethink the user experience,&quot; he said. &quot;So now, instead of relying on cascading menus or buttons, you could just have a box that says, what do you want to do today? And use machine learning to predict what the customer wants to do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For instance, if the customer is in a moving vehicle, just had an overdraft fee hit her account and is logging in to mobile banking, &quot;We can predict what you're going to do - you're coming to check your accounts. So let's use all the data, all the power of prediction we have to simplify the user experience.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Julian Martin</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vol. 1</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">No. 1</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">620  words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Email is the primary form of business communication - and with the rise in ransomware, phishing and other cyberattacks, email archiving has never been more critical. An email archive can, at times, be the single most important repository of corporate memory and if implemented effectively, can be the key to accessing the insight and knowledge contained within enormous volumes of enterprise email. As well as remaining the go-to location for compliance and variety regulatory frameworks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Traditional archiving - and the mindset around it - is flawed. In fact, according to new research from Mimecast and Vanson Bourne, 88 percent of organizations say they have experienced problems with their existing archiving practices. Nearly 60 percent cite administrative complexity as a top challenge, while 48 percent experience a lack of scalability. And another 56 percent are plagued by slow search performance.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you're still thinking about your archive in the traditional sense (that dusty on-prem catch-all), or if you're not thinking at all about your archive, you're likely making these costly, complicated - and completely avoidable - mistakes:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Ignoring upgrades. Haven't upgraded your archiving solution lately? You're not alone. On average, most organizations last updated their email archive two years ago. And only 38 percent have upgraded it in the last year. Ignoring updates means missing out on critical patches and bug fixes, which can constrain performance and reduce efficiency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Settling for &quot;Good Enough&quot; search. When you perform a search, you likely expect fast results - and you probably expect to find what you're looking for in one attempt. Unfortunately, the magic number when it comes to archive search is &quot;five&quot;: on average, users have to run five searches per query, and only five percent actually find what they need. It gets worse. 50 percent say these search queries take longer than five minutes each, with 20 percent reporting search completion times up to ten minutes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Underestimating the importance of e-discovery. Inefficient search is more than just frustrating. It can impact your ability to quickly respond to legal inquiries, and prevent you from meeting regulatory compliance obligations and external requests, like Subject Access Requests (SARs) and Right To Be Forgotten (RTFB) requests under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) - which is a concern for 84 percent of organizations. Perhaps because of the legal, regulatory and financial consequences, 44 percent of organizations are not totally confident in their current e-discovery capabilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Not planning for downtime. Uninterrupted access to email and archives during server downtime is a win-win for everyone: lines of communication stay open, productivity remains high, and disruption after a cyberattack remains low. That is why 91 percent of organizations say that in the event of system downtime or failure, they would want uninterrupted access to their email. Unfortunately, one-third say this isn't currently possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Storing your data in one place. Incidents like technical failure, human error and cyberattacks happen - and without sufficient backup and recovery in place, they can destroy your data. One corrupt email, one mistaken &quot;delete,&quot; or one phishing attack is all it takes to wipe out your entire corporate memory. Yet only 50 percent of organizations can recover all their data after one of these incidents occur, and a further 47 percent say they can recover only some of their data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The benefits of email archiving in the cloud are real. These include faster search speed, data recovery, long-term data preservation, fixed cost, and reduced IT administrative burden - to name just a handful.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Artificial intelligence is becoming a competitive advantage that will force institutions to incorporate it, according to participants at the BankAI conference this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People will have to adopt artificial intelligence,&quot; said Brian Pearce, senior vice president of artificial intelligence at Wells Fargo. &quot;It will have to become part of everyone's set of tools.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He isn't the only consumer banking executive who sees AI as a major factor in future survival.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have to keep up and we have to stay ahead,&quot; said Diane Morais, president of consumer and commercial banking products at Ally Bank.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But if one other thing was also clear at the conference, it was this: The road ahead is not going to be easy. Following is a guide to what banks are doing now and how it may evolve:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What banks are doing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wells Fargo is piloting several chatbot technologies, though it has yet to suggest a launch date for any of them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Pearce propounded an interesting use case for chatbots that hasn't been discussed before: bereavement assistance bots for bankers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Imagine someone close to you has passed away, maybe it's a parent or sibling, and you've been named the executor of their estate,&quot; Pearce said. &quot;You're sad, you're grieving, and you now have this messy financial situation to go through. And you're going to call us and you want to talk about handling the deceased person's estate. This is a terrible, terrible use case for a chatbot. You need a human here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bank has a team dedicated to bereavement - they take these phone calls and help executors manage the estates of the newly deceased.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You have a very emotional customer on the phone, and a very complicated set of laws and procedures,&quot; Pearce said. &quot;Unfortunately, the better the customer was, the more complicated it is. With 82 lines of business, you might have a lot of relationships with us - credit card, checking account, mortgage account, savings account, personal loan, car loan and so on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bank's new chatbot will let the customer service representative, who is on the phone being empathetic, ask questions of a knowledge-filled chatbot, like, &quot;In the state of California, what's the procedure for transferring a checking account to an estate?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wells is also working on a virtual assistant that will provide financial advice and recommendations to customers. And it plans to use AI to streamline operations, through the use of bots that &quot;do the boring stuff for us,&quot; Pearce said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bank of America</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michelle Moore, head of digital banking at Bank of America, shared an update on the virtual assistant it announced a year ago, erica. It's now in use by 300 employees. Sixty percent of the time, employees choose to interact with erica by voice, though they could also use chat, Moore said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Naming a chatbot is not as easy as it seems, she said - erica was one of the last names the bank considered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We were trying to think of one-syllable and two-syllable names, how to make it fast and easy,&quot; she said. &quot;We knew we wanted it to tie to our heritage so we were thinking of the name of the founder of Bank of America.&quot; Variations on that name were trademarked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bank's agency put erica, a play on the bank's name, to music and gave it a personality, and Moore's team was sold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It turns out that erica is a girl, after all. The bank has been insisting for the past year that erica was not female. But Moore said, &quot;It's kind of hard not to refer to her as a her versus an it because there is some personality to it. As you saw, when I said thank you, she said, 'my pleasure.' I prefer to refer to her as her.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It seems that erica is being created to be a professional - she's pleasant, polite and has a profanity filter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;erica won't be perfect - neither were Siri or Google Home at first - but she will be pretty darned good,&quot; Moore said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bank of America is using AI in many other areas, too, Moore shared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It will strengthen decisions around underwriting, fraud analytics and risk analytics,&quot; she said. &quot;Everything we use data for to make decisions - how do we automate that and turn it into a better experience for customers?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ally Bank</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ally Bank was one of the first to launch an AI-based virtual assistant two years ago: Ally Assist, which is based on technology from Personetics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ally Assist already provides a contextualized user experience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Consumers have the ability to speak or text questions, then based on how they interact with Ally Assist, the content is customized when they come back next time,&quot; Morais said. &quot;So if you're always checking your balances, always asking to see what your last five debit card transactions were, that content will be served up for you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most people who commonly interact with Ally Assist are heavier transaction customers, Morais said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're checking on their money a lot, they want to know where they stand, they want to be in control,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ally has also been testing an Alexa Skill for use with Amazon's Echo devices for a few weeks. It developed a special feature for Alexa called CurrenSee that tells the user how long they'd have to work to afford something they want to buy, like a smartphone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bank is also using AI in the back office. For instance, the bank used robotic process automation to streamline an exception process that had required back-office staff to navigate multiple screens and type hundreds of keystrokes. It now takes three clicks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The exception process team manager literally cried,&quot; Morais said. &quot;The team was so much happier doing things to actually help customers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To help confront identity theft, the bank partnered with UK company Featurespace, which provides AI-based behavioral analytics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The startup and the bank created what they call a deposit risk engine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've been able to ingest millions of data records, including transactional information, from our data lake, and put on top of that the tools and self-learning models,&quot; Morais said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fraud detection rates have gone up and security alerts have dropped, she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BBVA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Robert Sears, executive vice president and global head of product for new digital businesses at BBVA, said the bank is applying AI in credit decisions and focusing on explainability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You can't introduce models you can't explain,&quot; he said. &quot;Under the U.S. regulators and European regulations like GDPR, you have to explain how a model makes decisions. So as we build out the model, we're building out the tools for interpretability.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bank also plans to use AI to prevent fraud in account opening and to improve user experience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How banks see the future</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By late summer of next year, the help button in Bank of America's mobile app, as well as its interactive voice response system, will be replaced by erica.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the future, Moore sees erica working with Alexa, Siri and Google.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At Ally Bank, integration with digital speakers beyond Amazon Echo is in the plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We started with Alexa, and we believe in test, learn, apply,&quot; Morais said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pearce sees AI transforming mobile banking interfaces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That chat interface lets you really rethink navigation and rethink the user experience,&quot; he said. &quot;So now, instead of relying on cascading menus or buttons, you could just have a box that says, what do you want to do today?

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vol. 1</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">No. 1</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) introduces the new role of Data Protection Officer (DPO). While many organizations have had the title of such a role under the existing EU Directive, member states had different interpretations of what this meant. GDPR takes the responsibilities of the DPO to another level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To be able to effectively discharge the duties of the DPO, as outlined in Articles 38 and 39 of GDPR, the DPO needs to have a high authority in their organization, have a wide range of experience and be multiskilled, both technically and socially.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The requirement to appoint a DPO will mainly fall upon large corporations, government bodies, organizations in the health and social care sectors, financial institutions, and mostly organizations that are based in the EU.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) may also need a DPO role, as they could be a key component in a large corporate or government organization's supply chain. These cases probably will not be a dedicated role, and could even be brought in as a managed service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also for the first time, an organization acting as an information processor under an outsourced, managed service, such as a cloud service provider arrangement, may need to consider the role of DPO.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This all means there is going to be a large requirement to recruit DPOs. There are many job adverts out there requiring X number of years of GDPR experience, but these people simply do not exist. Yes, there are many data privacy professionals out there, but the requirements of the GDPR go beyond this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, what makes a good DPO?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The DPO needs a mix of skills and experience extending from data privacy into information risk management, relationship management, persuasive/negotiating skills, and the ability to operate at the highest levels within an organization. DPOs will need to be able to effectively communicate across the whole of the organization with the ability to articulate potential risk, in business terms. The DPO needs to understand the risk to information and how to appropriately and adequately protect this information related to its level of risk, through people, processes and technology; related governance processes; and management controls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The DPO's initial primary focus will be to get his or her organization ready to be GDPR-compliant by the May 2018 deadline, when GDPR becomes enforceable. This will require engagement with all areas of the organization to obtain a good understanding of the information, gathered, processed, stored and shared, with particular attention on Personal Identifiable Information (PII).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, once the DPO has the organization GDPR-ready, the DPO can add real business value by taking a wider view into information governance. With this in mind, larger organizations should seriously consider developing the DPO role in to the role of the Chief Data Officer (CDO).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of the skills and standing within an organization required belong to that of a Chief Data Officer (CDO). While the role of the CDO is wider than that of the DPO, there are many similarities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To sum up, there is massive requirement to recruit DPOs with GDPR experience. AsGDPR is only in its implementation phase, these people do not exist in the numbers required. Therefore, organizations need to take a more pragmatic view. Look at existing data protection professionals; can they be developed into the role of the DPO with training and coaching? Look at information risk and information governance professionals; can they be trained in data privacy? For the large corporates, look at the role of Chief Data Officer, and for SMEs, look at buying a managed service.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In May 2018, the European Union will implement the new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and companies are making major policy changes in preparation for its installment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In what Marsh calls &quot;the most significant overhaul of privacy law in a generation,&quot; the GDPR will bring enormous changes to Europe's data protection and privacy rules. The regulation establishes global requirements about how organizations that do business in the EU must manage and protect personal data, while strengthening the privacy rights of residents throughout the EU.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In anticipation of the new regulation, Marsh has released the results and analysis of a recent survey in a new report, titled &quot;GDPR Preparedness: An Indicator of Cyber Risk Management.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Related: Emerging cyber risks</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Emerging correlation between GDPR and cyber risk</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new study says the upcoming implementation of the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has elevated cyber risk to the top of the corporate agenda for organizations doing business in Europe. From the results of the survey, the report concludes that cyber risk management is both a cause and consequence of GDPR compliance, as the rules encourage businesses to adopt more rigid data protection practices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The international survey polled over 1,300 senior executives whose organizations offer products or services in the EU. 65% of respondents said they now consider cyber a top risk. This number has roughly doubled in the last year, as only 32% of respondents rated cyber as a top five risk in a similar Marsh survey conducted in 2016.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Related: Insurance-linked securities and cyber risk</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some are acting in response to the growing threat, as 23% of GDPR-impacted organizations say they were subject to a successful cyber-attack in the past year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The imminent implementation of the GDPR is spurring firms to take a fresh look at their cyber risk, not just their privacy protocols,&quot; said John Drzik, President of Global Risk &amp; Digital at Marsh. &quot;This survey indicates that the most prepared firms are using GDPR as a catalyst to enhance their cyber risk management, including a more economic evaluation of their risks and an increased focus on building resilience in the face of an inevitable cyber incident.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Preparing for the GDPR</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of the organizations subject to GDPR, two-thirds are preparing for or are compliant with the new rules taking effect this upcoming spring. As illustrated in the graphic to the right, 57% are in the process of developing a plan for compliance, and 8% say they are already fully compliant of the new impending rules.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The positive effects of the GDPR are already making themselves evident. The &quot;GDPR Preparedness&quot; report says organizations' preparation alone is creating a strong focus on expanding data protection and privacy issues, prompting related investments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The majority of respondents said they intend to spend more on cyber risk management. Of the organizations with plans for GDPR implementation, 78% plan to increase spending on cyber risk management over the next 12 months, including spending on cyber insurance. Among companies without a plan for GDPR, 52% also say they plan to increase spending on cyber risk management.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Related: Lloyd's: 92% of European businesses suffered a cyber breach in past 5 years</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Cyber risk management measures</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marsh surveyors asked respondents about the different cyber risk security measures their organizations have invested in or adopted in the last 12 to 24 months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among organizations compliant or developing a GDPR plan, here are the most popular cyber risk management measures adopted in the last 12 to 24 months:</SPAN></P>

</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From this question, Marsh data researchers concluded that the cyber risk management activities with the highest levels of participation were cybersecurity measures focused on defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, this question (along with others) highlighted how a large portion of companies are not yet prepared for the GDPR to be enacted in May, or currently have no plans to comply with the new regulations. This analysis posed further questions about the effects and challenges this may create for those companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thomas Reagan, Marsh's US Cyber Practice Leader, says, &quot;Given the effort needed to comply, organizations that have yet to make plans are likely to face challenges to meet all the requirements when GDPR takes effect in May 2018. Focusing leadership attention on complying with GDPR is critical. Increased management attention on this issue can also be leveraged to strengthen a firm's overall cyber risk management, broadening a regulatory compliance effort into a source of cybersecurity resilience.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oracle is not the first company that comes to mind when you think of enterprise security, but the company announced at its recent OpenWorld conference new products with artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning capabilities to quickly identify security threats.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company introduced two new sets of integrated suites called Oracle Identity Security Operations Center (SOC) and Oracle Management Cloud. It claims they will help enterprises forecast, reduce, detect and resolve cybersecurity threats in minutes rather than days and assist remediation of application and infrastructure performance issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It makes sense for Oracle to jump into this field even if it is full of established players like Symantec, Sophos, Tripwire and far more. Since Oracle's databases are often a target of hacker attacks, who better to secure an Oracle database than Oracle?&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the heart of the system is AI and machine learning using security and operational telemetry to identify problems when they happen instead of finding out about them months later, as so often happens. It can then provide automated remediation to not only security breaches, but also performance outages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oracle Management Cloud suite</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new Oracle Management Cloud suite combines Oracle Management Cloud, Oracle Application Performance Monitoring Service, and Oracle Infrastructure Monitoring Cloud Service. Combined, these services allow for real-time, proactive monitoring and outage prevention, whether it's deployed on premises or in the cloud. Oracle says the monitor can drill down to a line of SQL code if need be for error checking.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new Oracle Management Cloud suite includes the Standard Edition services, as well as Oracle IT Analytics Cloud Service and the new Oracle Orchestration Cloud Service. With the two new services, customers can choose to automate the entire problem of automatic identification and resolution using machine learning without any human intervention required.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Oracle Management Cloud has an analytics engine that is constantly updated with real-world data, providing it with evolving analytics. So, the engine constantly learns from the experiences of other customers. It can handle both &quot;massive raw data ingest,&quot; as well as &quot;context-based enrichment,&quot; and provide the steps for automated remediation. This makes the Management Cloud totally machine learning-driven and ideal for securing and managing complex enterprise networks.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oracle has also expanded its Oracle Log Analytics Cloud Service to monitor and analyze security and operational logs from a wide variety of both on-premises and cloud technologies, providing unified monitoring.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, the company said the new Oracle Configuration and Compliance Cloud Service is also now available. This service is designed to ensure continuous compliance with government regulatory requirements, including the rather onerous new EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) due to go into effect next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a remarkable turnaround for one of the kings of on-premises software. Oracle has pivoted to the cloud even faster than Microsoft, and it didn't take a change in leadership to do it. Along with Microsoft and Adobe, Oracle is one of the real success stories in cloud reinventions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Getting lawyers to embrace new technology in lieu of prodigious paper pillars can be a challenging effort. It would seem Axiom is up to the task.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The provider of technology-enabled legal and contracting solutions hired Doug Hebenthal as its chief technology officer. He is based in Seattle and charged with overseeing the creation of what the firm calls an &quot;industry-pioneering research and development center.&quot; It is expected to open early next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hebenthal is used to bringing about change. He most recently served as chief network engineering officer at analytics and software provider Change Healthcare. Before his work driving cloud adoption there, he was director of engineering for Amazon.com Inc.'s ecommerce payments platform. Hebenthal also spent more than 20 years at Microsoft Corp., where he worked on the early stages of development of networking and the internet. He then went on to serve as a founding member of the team that developed the Xbox gaming system. Now he will work on expanding Axiom's technology vision, artificial intelligence capabilities and contract automation tools, and will also focus on building new technology-driven legal solutions as customer needs arise.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the corporate side, a Thomson Reuters report today, &quot;http://legalsolutions.thomsonreuters.com/law-products/ns/news-views/corporate-counsel/legal-department-2025/artificial-intelligence/ai-report|Ready or Not: Artificial Intelligence and Corporate Legal Departments,&quot; measured the perceptions of more than 200 in-house attorneys. &quot;There is this lingering fear among some of our survey participants that AI will possibly replace lawyers,&quot; said Mark Haddad, head of the corporate segment for Thomson Reuters. He opined, &quot;But technological advances in the legal industry have always focused on evolving the business and practice of law and improving how legal professionals work and process information. While tasks may be managed by a new technology, the work that lawyers perform - the work that only a lawyer can do - will not be outsourced to machines. And new timesaving or data-crunching technologies will act as facilitators to corporate in-house professionals to better serve their business.&quot; The report notes that more than half (56%) of in-house attorneys either perceive that AI technology is not used or are not yet familiar with the use of AI technology in their legal department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beyond the efficiency of AI, and given the higher frequency of hacking incidents both large and small in many industries, Movers reached out to Axiom about its cyber defense. The incoming CTO said &quot;One of the most critical issues facing business today is securing customers' information from cyber attacks and theft. This is no different for Axiom and the legal industry as we deal with some of our customers' most critical data.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We will also be adding new talent to our security team to make sure we are continually reviewing and raising the bar on our security posture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vice president of technology James Taylor details:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cybersecurity can't be achieved with a one-size-fits-all solution. Across our Contracts Platform lines of business, this means complying with the particular security protocols dictated by new regulation (e.g. GDPR, UMR) and building a process that protects the [critical nature] of our clients' data across both cloud-based and physical server locations (in our M&amp;A business).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taylor continued, &quot;Our three centers of excellence are fully ISO compliant. He continued, &quot;We also apply this rigorous view of security to the partners we choose. Axiom partners must have the same level of security certifications in order to do business with us (i.e. Salesforce, Kira Systems, kCura).&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guggenheim Securities, the investment banking and capital markets division of Guggenheim Partners, will bring in John Jedlicka as a senior managing director in the financial institutions group. He will start in the New York office in November and advise diversified financial services companies. Jedlicka will come in from Bank of America Merrill Lynch, where he was a managing director and co-head of banks and specialty finance. He was also a managing director at Credit Suisse Group from November 2008 and Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., where he worked in New York and Los Angeles from 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Separately, Guggenheim Securities hired Gary Rygh as a senior managing director in the firm's power, energy and renewables investment banking group in New York. He joins from Barclays, where he was a managing director in the global power and utilities group. Previously, Rygh was a senior vice president at Lehman Brothers in the global power group and worked at Morgan Stanley as an executive director in the power and utilities group. He started his career at Barr Devlin Associates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also in New York, Guggenheim hired Stephen Finkel, Ethan Sawyer and Ori Winitzer as senior managing directors to advise companies across the media and entertainment sectors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finkel was a managing director at Rothschild Inc., where he spent 10 years advising global media and sports companies. He was previously a director on Credit Suisse's media and telecom investment banking team and a corporate attorney at Davis Polk &amp; Wardell LLP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sawyer was a managing director in Morgan Stanley's media and communications group and head of global entertainment investment banking. He also previously worked as a consultant at Mercer Management Consulting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Winitzer joins from LionTree where he was among the firm's earliest employees and built its product focused on emerging companies. Before that, Winitzer was a member of Rothschild's media and technology investment banking team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barclays plc banker Reid Marsh, who since January has been co-head of Asia Pacific with Jaideep Khanna (now sole head), was named head of banking for Europe, the Middle East and Asia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marsh arrived in 2010 from Citigroup Inc. in London as chairman of the industrials group. He was Citi's co-head of global industrials and previously worked at Salomon Smith Barney and Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cantor Fitzgerald &amp; Co. hired Jon Yalmokas as global head of prime brokerage, based in New York. Yalmokas was head of Americas prime brokerage at Bank of America Merrill Lynch since 2011, and previously served as head of financing sales, capital introduction and consulting at UBS Investment Bank.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Directors and executives want to believe their companies are adequately protected against cyber threats. ISACA'srecent survey of leadership teamsreinforces the notion that most corporate leadership teams recognize cyber risk is a material threat to their businesses. As the research points out, 55 percent of respondents agree that their organization's leadership team or board is doing everything it can to safeguard the organization's digital assets. But, does this perception represent reality?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a recent study conducted earlier this year byNYSE Governance Services and Diligent, 381 directors of public companies were surveyed regarding their secure communication practices and their level of awareness of how those practices might impact the company's level of cyber risk. The results were sobering - and indicate a disconnect between what directors and executives believe about cyber security and the cyber risk created by their own communication practices.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To illustrate this point, consider that 92 percent of respondents use personal email accounts - including unsecured systems like Yahoo! Mail, Gmail, and AOL - at least occasionally to conduct board business. While 74 percent reported using secure board communication software to receive and transmit sensitive documents, 54% regularly download these documents onto personal devices or drives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even when companies use secure board communication software, only 8 percent ask the IT, IS or data security team to sanction directors' communication methods. Worse still, 62 percent indicated their company doesn't require directors to participate in any cyber security training, and in ISACA's new research, only 15% of respondents expect their organizations will fund an increase in cyber security training for board members in the next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why does this matter? The job of a director requires access to extremely sensitive company data. Yet, directors don't often receive direct oversight from the IT or data security team. Hackers have clearly figured this out. Consider this report onChina's APT 10 hacking group, which specifically targets corporate directors as an easy entry point to high-value information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even someone as sophisticated as former Secretary of State Colin Powell, a director of Salesforce,was successfully hackedwhen a slide deck for an upcoming Salesforce board meeting was stolen from a personal email account. The data from the slide deck was leaked to the Wall Street Journal in advance of the board meeting, negatively impacting both Salesforce's business strategy and its share price.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, a number of new regulations are cracking down on corporate negligence on cyber security and data privacy, and are holding directors and executives responsible for breaches. In March 2017, new regulations took effect with theNew York State Department of Financial Servicesthat require board members (or senior officers) to personally certify that the company has adequate cyber security programs in place, and that those programs are regularly tested and reviewed. While this regulation is at the state level, it applies to any financial services firm - and any vendors serving those firms - that conducts business in New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another case in point is the EU's newGeneral Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)- set to take full effect in May 2018. This new regulation includes fines as high as 4 percent of annual worldwide turnover in the event of a major breach, as well as potential jail time for the directors or executives who are responsible. GDPR doesn't just apply to EU companies; rather, any company that stores, processes, or accesses the data of EU citizens is liable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both of these regulations reinforce the idea that directors and top executives hold the ultimate responsibility for overseeing cyber security and risk management for their organizations. Not only must they be aware of the cyber security programs and risk profile of their companies, they must also set the right tone for the rest of the company's employees - demonstrating by their adherence to secure communication policies and practices that cyber security is important enough to warrant the regular time and attention of the company's leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This all begs the question &quot; why are corporate leaders so bullish on their level of cyber security? Perhaps one culprit is the approach we generally take to raising cyber security issues in our boardrooms. Most board discussions on cyber risk include a &quot;briefing&quot; by the CSO/IT security team on what the company is doing to secure customer data and internal systems. Rarely do these briefings include a review of director communication methods, raising directors' awareness of their own cyber risk, and training on how to handle sensitive data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's time for us to help directors understand their real level of cyber risk and provide them with the secure tools, training and support to keep their communication - and our companies' data - safe. An easy first step is to provide this article to your directors and add some time on the next board meeting agenda to discuss it. Get directors' concerns out in the open. Only by candidly reviewing what's happening now - and what should be happening - can any change be implemented.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While investors might have come to the realization they need to start asking cybersecurity-related questions of their portfolio companies, getting started can be a bit more testing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some money management firms, however, are already working on it.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As investors we need to better understand from companies the materiality of the exposure to cyberrisk to their business and the quality of their risk mitigation&quot; or business resilience, said My-Linh Ngo, senior ESG analyst at BlueBay Asset Management in London. &quot;We have started to raise questions in this area with companies in higher risk sectors we meet,&quot; such as retail and financial sectors, &quot;and intend to continue to do so going forward.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Legal &amp; General Investment Management has been engaging on the topic since 2011, said David Patt, senior analyst, corporate governance and public policy in London. &quot;Investors need to discuss these issues at the highest level with board directors to raise awareness and get the board involved. It is a key operational and financial risk, not something just left for the IT department to deal with. This issue will only intensify in the future, so investors need to start the conversation with companies today to better understand their exposure.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hermes Investment Management thinks of cybersecurity as both a governance and social issue, and the potential &quot;value destruction&quot; of a company is a big worry, said Louise Dudley, London-based portfolio manager on the global equities team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In looking at a company, Hermes executives want to know what has been done to prepare for any cyberrisk, what evidence companies have in terms of the validity of their cyber solutions and what their plans are going forward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And what is the worst case: what does that look like for you?&quot; added Ms. Dudley.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When it comes to the responses managers are getting, Robeco's Michiel Plakman, portfolio manager, Robeco global equity and Dani&euml;lle Essink-Zuiderwijk, senior social engagement specialist of Robeco's active ownership team said it depends on the company. &quot;For most companies that are not in the (technology, media and telecommunications) or financial services (sectors,) data security is still an after-thought,&quot; they said in a joint statement. &quot;However, with the move to digital, this will become more important, and as shown by GDPR, every company will need a detailed cybersecurity and data privacy strategy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As part of a collaborative engagement to help improve investor understanding of the project, the Principles for Responsible Investment has put together a list of key questions to help equip investors in conversation with companies on the topic. These questions include:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Does the company publicly commit to be in compliance with all relevant laws, including cyber and data protection laws?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Does the company provide training on information and/or cybersecurity requirements to all employees?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Are there any controversies related to cyberattacks? How does the company respond to the cyberattacks and what is the broader stakeholder feedback on cyberattacks at the company?</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Insurance-linked securities (ILS) are a way to access additional financial protection outside the traditional insurance and reinsurance providers, typically through capital markets. ILS are most commonly associated with catastrophe bonds providing reinsurance cover in the event of significant natural catastrophes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cyber risk is one of the most discussed new areas of risk for the insurance industry to address. As a relatively new exposure, the development of cyber insurance solutions presents a range of challenges, including specific challenges for those seeking to offer ILS solutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Related: The future of work in insurance</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Catastrophe risks and ILS</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ILS have made considerable progress within the catastrophe reinsurance market, in part because there is a degree of consensus on the way in which the risks can be modelled. This level of consensus has arisen as data relating to past catastrophes has been analysed and knowledge shared across the market. Therefore, investors in ILS can have some comfort in the pricing of ILS and the assessment of potential risks and returns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the chance of a natural catastrophe is uncertain, it is possible to analyse the available data on past claims and events to develop an informed estimate of that likelihood. The risk of an earthquake or flood is likely to be highly correlated with past experience for a specific geographic area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nature of losses is also likely to be consistent, with property damage a prime issue. The risk of such losses will be closely linked to known perils such as floods or windstorms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course factors such as global warming, or the decision to build on flood-prone areas can influence potential outcomes. However, such issues are regularly discussed and broadly understood, and investors appear to have become comfortable with backing ILS structures based on existing models.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Challenges for cyber risk</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In contrast, cyber risk poses a number of challenges in developing an agreed approach to assessing the risk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Firstly, cyber risk is not a clearly defined term. It is, in fact, a term covering a number of related risks including:</SPAN></P>

<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Restoration.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This list is not exhaustive, and different insurers may cover different mixtures of risks, requiring a variety of concurrent modelling approaches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Secondly, the trigger for cyber claims is very different. The existence of a natural catastrophe is likely to gather much publicity so the existence and scope of the event is public knowledge. Cyber risks are often related to malicious or criminal intent to steal data. Such events may become public but it is widely believed that many organisations prefer not to go public (and make others aware of their vulnerability) when confronting cyber incidents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The risk of an incident is part of an ongoing struggle between those seeking access to systems with criminal intent and the effectiveness of systems and staff to manage these risks. Such claims can become more frequent if new means of hacking become available or less frequent if system protections are readily updated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Related: What's your data breach response plan?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thirdly, insurers need to assess to what extent companies and individuals should be protected if they have neglected basic precautions such as (regularly updated) anti-virus software. Underwriters currently seek such information on particular policies but it is difficult to develop an ILS product which responds at an aggregate level to risks which may be strongly dependent on the actions and cultures of different organisations. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Will the ILS industry rise to the challenge?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As noted above there are significant challenges in developing standard products suitable for an ILS approach. However, much effort is likely to go into trying to develop solutions including ILS because the potential market is very large. Virtually all organisations have some exposure to cyber risk and the costs of claims could be extensive. If most organisations can be convinced that appropriate insurance cover should be part of the process for managing this risk, the potential premium could be significant.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Education, education, education</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A key initial task will be to educate the various parties involved in ILS structures of the nature of cyber risk and the potential benefits of offering a product.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The potentially large premiums remain likely to compel interest. One estimate of the market was that pure cyber risk premiums amounted to $2.5 billion in 2016 (an increase of 35% on the prior year). Some elements of cyber risk are also likely to be covered in other policy classes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevertheless, key market participants may be less than enthusiastic to share details of their experience which they may view as commercially sensitive. The absence of publicly available data and the non-standard nature of cyber insurance products mean the growth of an ILS market will remain challenging.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Related: 5 trends and factors that continue to impact cybersecurity in 2017</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Public claims may drive change</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While details of some claims remain confidential there are other data breaches that inevitably become well known due to their scale. As such incidents are published the appetite for insurance to cover the risk may increase.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If large claims emerge then insurers will need to seek reinsurance support. This is likely to drive exchanges of information as reinsurers try to assess their potential exposures. It is at this stage that opportunities for ILS structures may be more likely to emerge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even if risks remain to some extent non-standard, it may be possible to analyse risks by exposure to particular hardware or software. The status of third party providers may also have an impact, as their own security and risk management practices may have downstream implications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Informally or formally underwriters may start to agree on key issues that will contribute to the assessment of risk to specific organisations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Related: Rethinking a digital approach to insurance</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Legislation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new EU legislation on data protection (GDPR) is already having a profound impact on organisations as they seek to ensure compliance. This will drive an awareness of the risks inherent in holding personal data and consideration of means to manage those risks, including insurance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The level of risks will also increase as the costs in potential fines and compensation have to be factored into business decisions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Outlook</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At this stage it remains challenging to develop ILS solutions as the cyber risk market remains relatively new. Underwriters are likely to have differing views on the potential for claims and there are no widely agreed ways to quantify the risks involved. Furthermore, the nature of cyber risk remains diverse and will need more rigorous definition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, I am optimistic that these issues can be addressed over time. The ILS industry has shown its willingness to innovate outside natural catastrophe risk, including insuring large lottery pay-outs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As with natural catastrophes, the costs involved in major data breaches can be high and legislation means that the risks are increasing. Therefore, insurers and reinsurers will need access to capital to back these risks. I would anticipate that solutions will gradually emerge and that ILS will play a role in supporting these solutions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The General Data Protection Regulation doesn't come into effect until May 2018 but it is already having a profound impact on many organizations that process the personal data of EU citizens, as well as those citizens directly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Organizations should have started their compliance initiative by now and many that have are finding it to be a huge logistical task. Challenges involve internal awareness and training, reviewing policies and procedures, defining and changing data flows and system/data auditing. Each one of these compliance tasks is pitted against the backdrop of the huge increase in enterprise data and could involve the assessment of massive multi-jurisdictional databases or documents that run into the hundreds of millions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the area that I work in, I'm seeing organizations respond by conducting information and security audits as a starting-point for remedial action. Such remedial action might involve data silo consolidations, changing from optimistic to pessimistic security models, new information classifications and retention policies, data-clean-up (&quot;minimization&quot;) and new security measures, especially for sensitive data types as defined in Article 9.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GDPR also introduces the obligation that organizations adopt privacy by design and default (Article 25). As a result, I've seen organizations want permanent management of personal information in data repositories (volumes, growth, age, redundancy, permissions) as well as monitoring of suspicious user behaviors or data breaches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The scale of these tasks is large, especially around personal data in huge repositories and unstructured documents. Data crawling tools and analytics can help. Organizations are adopting solutions that crawl and index multiple data sources. Using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) helps make dark data discoverable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once in the appropriate form, data mining techniques such as Named Entity Recognition (NER), Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine-Learning classification can help find personal data within the relevant context - the aim is to find someone's health data instead of just a reference to a health term. Then, solutions can help to allocate the clean-up tasks to the right people and purge any redundant data or secure any sensitive data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the security side, some solutions can utilize machine learning to determine &quot;normal vs. abnormal&quot; user behavior and help to flag potential data breaches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the other side of the processor/owner relationship is the Citizen, and they are being made aware of their enhanced rights through the press and awareness campaigns by EU governments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some will undoubtedly be thinking about how they might exercise these rights, such as Data Subject Access Requests (DSARs) and the right to be forgotten. So, organizations should be fully prepared for responding to DSARs within 30 days across potentially tens of thousands of documents and emails and they can't charge the person making the request.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I've regularly heard of DSARs costing organizations &pound;5000-&pound;50,000 each because it requires a small team to trawl through a huge amount of data - and often with a fine-tooth comb. This is because personal information is very broadly defined and is mixed with sensitive business information or personal information of third parties within the same document. Also, there are legal exemptions to disclosure, such as litigation or legal privilege.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Organizations should devote lots of effort to defining the workflow process for each DSAR. Have an itinerary of systems to search or adopt enterprise search solutions which could search across all of them and utilize the same data mining techniques mentioned earlier. Ensure that dark data is searchable and have the right tools for expediting review, including a playbook for personal data identification and the right tools for redaction. Also, the data must be transferred to the requester in a secure way so organizations are looking at secure online portals as email would not be appropriate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unfortunately, there isn't a one-size-fits-all GDPR solution for organizations since each are different in how they interact with personal data. But start with defining your data flows and think about the risks. Once you've identified a remedial action, think about how technology could assist in the process.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What happens when a cookie of a Brit in London lands in the server of a community bank in the U.S. if, on an off-chance, the Brit browses the bank's website?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's unclear, experts say, but U.S. banks - especially small and midsize banks - need to go find out because the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) could affect them, unlike the EU privacy regulations before it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The countdown is ticking on GDPR'swebsite. The law, approved by the European Parliament in April 2016, will take effect in late May 2018. It will apply to &quot;all companies processing and holding the personal data of data subjects residing in the European Union, regardless of the company's location,&quot; the website said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Basically any institution around the world that has an EU citizen, a European subject, is subject to the law,&quot; said Steve Ehrlich, lead analyst for emerging technologies at Spitzberg Partners LLC, a corporate advisory firm. &quot;An EU subject doesn't have to be a customer or employee.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The law can apply even if the company does not have a European business arm, said Pam Dingle, principal technical architect at Ping Identity, a firm that helps companies manage their personnel's identification needs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of GDPR's provisions will require banks to behave differently than under existing U.S. regulations. One example is that banks need to report data breaches to authorities within 72 hours of their discovery. &quot;That's not a lot of time,&quot; Dingle said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Large banks are already familiar with the law, said Andy Roth, partner at the law firm Cooley LLP, who focuses on legal issues surrounding new technology. But smaller banks &quot;are just recognizing that they have a potential exposure&quot; and &quot;are now starting to understand what they need to do to get in compliance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GDPR also requires companies to provide clients with full access to data about themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A European data subject can make requests on what data the bank has on it, and can make changes and request deletion of the data,&quot; said Roth, who is a former chief privacy officer at American Express. &quot;These require business practices that banks don't have in the U.S.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Companies with multiple legacy systems will face one of the toughest challenges, Dingle said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The first problem you will have when you deal with GDPR is that you have to somehow be able to reconcile how the data flows between all these different databases, even though they were made in different times, they may have different formats and the data might be called something different,&quot; she said. &quot;That's why a lot of these beautiful ideas of GDPR are very difficult in reality for people to execute on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Employees' attitudes toward personally identifiable information need to change, too, Dingle said. Simple things such as exporting company data to a spreadsheet so one can work at home can put customer data at risk, she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When found in violation of GDPR, a firm can be fined 2% or 4% of revenue. &quot;There's real enforcement risk,&quot; Roth said. That said, Roth and Ehrlich agreed that fines are higher for the worst offenders, while first-time violators face less risk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unlike some U.S. regulations, GDPR is not a law that banks can just say they substantially comply with, Ehrlich said, because compliance for GDPR needs to be demonstrated through documentation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roth agreed, saying that GDPR drives companies to develop documentation ahead of time - &quot;not waiting for something to happen and then investigate it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While larger banks are on the way to compliance, many community banks are assessing whether the law will apply to them, and what needs to be done, Roth said. Both Ehrlich and Roth said whether a small bank falls under GDPR is a case-by-case issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some matters, such as the browser-cookie question, are open to interpretation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ehrlich said most banks &quot;would be subject to GDPR because the definition of privacy is changing&quot; and cookies can be within its purview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Roth said that &quot;merely having a website that allows a few users to come from Europe, I'm not sure that it triggers the requirement.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Community banks lack in-house experts who understand what GDPR means for them, said Ehrlich.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guidance from the regulators on compliance will be anticipated, said a community banker who spoke on condition of anonymity. His bank has been assessing where it falls short of GDPR standards, and reaching out to federal regulators, vendors and consultants to gauge the potential impact of the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GDPR can be a challenge for community banks, but it could also be an opportunity, Ehrlich and Roth said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Larger banks have evolved to focus on data, and they understand how important data and the proprietary advantages in data are, especially in the digital world,&quot; Roth said. Community banks have been less focused on data, he said. &quot;It is one of the thingssmaller banks need to do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AHarvard Business Reviewarticle in 2016 said that banks have achieved higher sales and growth from extensive analysis of their customers' data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clients are willing to trade their information if they can get equitable return, and they feel they have control over their data, Ehrlich said. &quot;For banks, it can be anything from a higher interest rate, or loyalty program, or prepaid gift card.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Privacy concerns will rise with the advent of the internet of things, since smart devices will be able to collect large amount of personal information, Ehrlich said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the internet of things becomes predominant, &quot;people are going to be very interested in what data is being collected about them and for what purposes,&quot; Ehrlich said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Banks &quot;should focus on operational risk management and information governance because these are unifying across the schemes,&quot; Roth said. &quot;That's the best thing they can do for themselves in the future.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What happens when a cookie of a Brit in London lands in the server of a community bank in the U.S. if, on an off-chance, the Brit browses the bank's website?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's unclear, experts say, but U.S. banks - especially small and midsize banks - need to go find out because the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) could affect them, unlike the EU privacy regulations before it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The countdown is ticking on GDPR'swebsite. The law, approved by the European Parliament in April 2016, will take effect in late May 2018. It will apply to &quot;all companies processing and holding the personal data of data subjects residing in the European Union, regardless of the company's location,&quot; the website said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Basically any institution around the world that has an EU citizen, a European subject, is subject to the law,&quot; said Steve Ehrlich, lead analyst for emerging technologies at Spitzberg Partners LLC, a corporate advisory firm. &quot;An EU subject doesn't have to be a customer or employee.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The law can apply even if the company does not have a European business arm, said Pam Dingle, principal technical architect at Ping Identity, a firm that helps companies manage their personnel's identification needs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of GDPR's provisions will require banks to behave differently than under existing U.S. regulations. One example is that banks need to report data breaches to authorities within 24 hours of their discovery. &quot;That's not a lot of time,&quot; Dingle said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Large banks are already familiar with the law, said Andy Roth, partner at the law firm Cooley LLP, who focuses on legal issues surrounding new technology. But smaller banks &quot;are just recognizing that they have a potential exposure&quot; and &quot;are now starting to understand what they need to do to get in compliance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GDPR also requires companies to provide clients with full access to data about themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A European data subject can make requests on what data the bank has on it, and can make changes and request deletion of the data,&quot; said Roth, who is a former chief privacy officer at American Express. &quot;These require business practices that banks don't have in the U.S.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Companies with multiple legacy systems will face one of the toughest challenges, Dingle said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The first problem you will have when you deal with GDPR is that you have to somehow be able to reconcile how the data flows between all these different databases, even though they were made in different times, they may have different formats and the data might be called something different,&quot; she said. &quot;That's why a lot of these beautiful ideas of GDPR are very difficult in reality for people to execute on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Employees' attitudes towards personally identifiable information need to change, too, Dingle said. Simple things such as exporting company data to a spreadsheet so one can work at home can put customer data at risk, she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When found in violation of GDPR, a firm can be fined 2% or 4% of revenue. &quot;There's real enforcement risk,&quot; Roth said. That said, both Roth and Ehrlich agreed that fines are higher for the worst offenders, while first-time violators face less risk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unlike some U.S. regulations, GDPR is not a law that banks can just say they substantially comply with, Ehrlich said, because compliance for GDPR needs to be demonstrated through documentation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roth agreed, saying that GDPR drives companies to develop documentation ahead of time - &quot;not waiting for something to happen and then investigate it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While larger banks are on the way to compliance, many community banks are assessing whether the law will apply to them, and what needs to be done, Roth said. Both Ehrlich and Roth said whether a small bank falls under GDPR is a case-by-case issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some matters, such as the browser-cookie question, are open to interpretation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ehrlich said most banks &quot;would be subject to GDPR because the definition of privacy is changing&quot; and cookies can be within its purview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Roth said that &quot;merely having a website that allows a few users to come from Europe, I'm not sure that it triggers the requirement.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Community banks lack in-house experts who understand what GDPR means for them, said Ehrlich.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guidance from the regulators on compliance will be anticipated, said a community banker who spoke on condition of anonymity. His bank has been assessing where it falls short of GDPR standards, and reaching out to federal regulators, vendors and consultants to gauge the potential impact of the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whereas GDPR can be a challenge for community banks, it could also be an opportunity, Ehrlich and Roth said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Larger banks have evolved to focus on data, and they understand how important data and the proprietary advantages in data are, especially in the digital world,&quot; Roth said. Community banks have been less focused on data, he said. &quot;It is one of the thingssmaller banks need to do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AHarvard Business Reviewarticle in 2016 said that banks have achieved higher sales and growth from extensive analysis of their customers' data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clients are willing to trade their information if they can get equitable return, and they feel they have control over their data, Ehrlich said. &quot;For banks, it can be anything from a higher interest rate, or loyalty program, or prepaid gift card.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Privacy concerns will rise with the advent of the internet of things, since smart devices will be able to collect large amount of personal information, Ehrlich said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">USAArecently joinedCapital One, American Express and some other financial institutions to offer virtual assistant service on Alexa, Amazon's artificial-intelligence-powered voice interactive device.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the internet of things become predominant, &quot;people are going to be very interested in what data is being collected about them and for what purposes,&quot; Ehrlich said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While not all banks may be affected by GDPR, privacy practices in the EU and the U.S. do overlap, Roth said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Banks should focus on operational risk management and information governance because these are unifying across the schemes,&quot; Roth said. &quot;That's the best thing they can do for themselves in the future.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vol. 1</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">No. 1</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There has been a lot written over the past year or so about the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) - what is required, and what needs to be accomplished sooner rather than later in order to meet the May 25, 2018 compliance date. And with 99 articles, with hundreds of requirements within them, covered within the GDPR, there are certainly many topics that must be addressed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While seven to eight months may seem like a long time to address them all, it is important for those responsible for GDPR compliance activities to realize that some of those activities will necessarily take many weeks of planning and preparation, and then most likely many additional weeks of actual implementation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One case in point is performing a GDPR compliant data protection impact assessment (DPIA). I've heard and read a variety of statements made about DPIAs over the past several months, and I want to correct and clarify a few of the ones that I've heard that have been especially of concern.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><UL CLASS="c9"><LI CLASS="c10"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"><NOBR>&bull;</NOBR></SPAN></P>
<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've already done a privacy impact assessment (PIA), so I've got the GDPR DPIA requirement already taken care of!&quot; Wait; not so fast. While I view a DPIA as a specific type of PIA (this is debated by various fans and foes of both the DPIA and PIAs, but in my experience doing more than 100 PIAs and more than a dozen DPIAs, I believe that, with the outliers that can be effectively addressed, a DPIA fits well within the larger PIA domain), a DPIA does have important and significant differences to a traditional PIA. So, don't think that just since you've done a PIA at some point within the past year or two that you've met all the GDPR requirements for a DPIA.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
</LI><LI CLASS="c10"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"><NOBR>&bull;</NOBR></SPAN></P>
<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our lawyers told us it was a legal activity, and that IT, privacy and information security folks don't need to bother with worrying about doing a DPIA.&quot; While you need to do a DPIA to meet GDPR legal requirements, the answers that you will need to provide will typically not be known to the legal department, so it will need to include involvement from key stakeholders in IT, information security and privacy. And if you're waiting for the legal department to contact you to ask you simple yes and no questions, keep in mind that many of the answers you will need to provide for an accurate and acceptable DPIA will not be yes or no. To determine as accurate of risk level calculations as possible, you must provide more detailed descriptions for where you are at with accomplishing activities.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
</LI><LI CLASS="c10"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"><NOBR>&bull;</NOBR></SPAN></P>
<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I got a free 10-question GDPR readiness checklist from the Internet, so I'll use that for my DPIA.&quot; That is a dangerous, and incorrect, belief. A checklist is not an assessment. I am a fan of using checklists to keep track of progress with projects to make sure that I have addressed specific topics fully, to answer truly yes/no types of dichotomy questions, or to cross off the items I wanted to get at the grocery store after I put each in my cart. An assessment is not an either/or dichotomy. An assessment includes doing various types and levels of analysis, and arriving to an assessment that could be any number of answers, representing a multitude of risk levels. GDPR checklists that boil down the high-level activities you need to do can be helpful; a checklist, though, will not accomplish the necessary GDPR required DPIA.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A significant purpose for requiring organizations to conduct DPIAs is to identify and reduce the data protection risks within projects, networks and systems, reduce the likelihood of privacy harms to data subjects, and to determine the levels to which all of the applicable 99 GDPR articles have been implemented by the organization. Traditional PIAs have not fully addressed consideration of harms to data subjects (but that is important for all to address whether or not it is for DPIA), and certainly traditional PIAs did not look at the specific DPIA requirements that are unique from traditional PIA topics covered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the specific point of performing a DPIA, I recommend that organizations use a framework that not only addresses and meets the GDPR requirements, but can also meet other requirements for performing other types of privacy impact assessments. I've created a PIA framework, based upon the ISACA Privacy Principles, which consolidates similar privacy principle requirements and topics into the 14 ISACA Privacy Principles, and maps all the DPIA requirements within them, in addition to those DPIA questions also mapping to other standards, frameworks and regulatory data protection requirements.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In May 2018, the General Data Privacy Regulation will take effect, significantly altering the way organizations handle and store data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At 200 pages and 99 articles, the comprehensive regulation is primarily intended to strengthen security and privacy protections around individual data, which it enforces by subjecting organizations to stricter requirements, adding new requirements - such as breach notification - and increasing fines on organizations that fail to comply.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GDPR applies to all organizations that control or process data within the EU as well as those that control or process data related to EU residents. This means that, while GDPR is rooted in the EU, organizations in the U.S. that handle data from EU residents are very much impacted as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among other things, organizations will be required to maintain a data breach detection plan, regularly evaluate the effectiveness of security practices, and document evidence of compliance. However, GDPR doesn't provide specific technical direction, meaning that organizations will be independently responsible for establishing and maintaining the best practices needed to uphold outlined data security requirements. With this in mind, below are nine steps to prepare for the security requirements within GDPR.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Step 1: Implement a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tool with log management capabilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Article 30 of GDPR states that every controller must track and record all processing activities under its responsibility. To do this, organizations typically leverage a SIEM tool, which centralizes logs from applications, systems and networks, allowing companies to monitor all user and system activity and to identify any suspicious or malicious behavior.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Users can create a view of what has occurred to investigate suspicious behavior, including analyzing what kind of attack method was utilized and looking at related events, source IP addresses, destination IP addresses and other details. Organizations with data stored in the cloud should ensure that their SIEM tool can record activity not only on-premises but also across the public and private cloud infrastructure, as personal data held there also falls within the scope of GDPR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Step 2: Create an inventory of all critical assets that store or process sensitive data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because GDPR covers all IT systems, networks and devices, organizations must maintain an ongoing inventory of where personal data is stored across the entire infrastructure. This seems simple on the surface, but can be a difficult task, especially in public cloud environments and in cases where employees are using BYOD or non-IT-sanctioned assets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's worth noting that organizations with employees that process or store data on unapproved devices are still liable and subject to regulatory fines in the event of an attack, so it's critical that all components of an organization's IT system are identified and monitored. There are a variety of asset discovery tools available to help organizations continually keep track of where sensitive data is held.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Step 3: Undertake vulnerability scanning to identify weaknesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New vulnerabilities arise almost daily, whether they're in software, system configuration, business logic or processes. Therefore, organizations must stay on top of these with regular vulnerability scanning. It's also important to determine the threat level of each vulnerability by considering factors such as:</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Does the affected system fall within the scope of GDPR?&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

</LI><LI CLASS="c10"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"><NOBR>&bull;</NOBR></SPAN></P>
<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How critical is the threat? (i.e. how many personal records could be exposed?)&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is the vulnerability being exploited by attackers in the wild, and if so, how?&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here too, it is equally important to monitor cloud environments in addition to on-premises environments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Step 4: Conduct risk assessments and apply threat models relevant to the business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Organizations must identify and evaluate all of their security risks, not just vulnerabilities. Article 35 of GDPR mandates data protection impact assessments (DPIAs), and Article 32 requires companies to &quot;implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk.&quot; This mandate is intentionally broad so that organizations can leverage whichever information security framework provides the best understanding of the risks facing their systems. NIST and ISO / IEC 27001 are a few common and effective options.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Step 5: Regularly test your systems to gain assurance that security controls are working as designed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Article 32 addresses the security of personal data processing by demanding thatorganizations create a procedure to regularly analyze the effectiveness of their security controls. This is by no means an easy feat (and becomes increasingly difficult as organizations grow and expand their technology stacks). However, three possible strategies to validate the effectiveness of security controls include:</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Using manual assurance (e.g., audits, assurance reviews, penetration testing and red-team activities).&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
</LI><LI CLASS="c10"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"><NOBR>&bull;</NOBR></SPAN></P>
<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consolidating and integrating security products (so that fewer point products need to be managed and reported on).&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's important to note that ensuring that systems are secured as intended is not a one-time effort; rather, it must be an ongoing, repeatable process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Step 6: Put threat detection controls in place to ensure reliable and timely notification when a breach has occurred.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GDPR requires that organizations report a breach to the appropriate regulatory body within 72 hours of becoming aware of it. For high-risk incidents, impacted data subjects must be notified without undue delay (Article 31). In order to be able to discover, adequately understand and respond to breaches so quickly, organizations must have threat detection controls in place to trigger immediate alerts around incidents. Users can then develop an understanding of the threat by collecting and correlating events, and referencing reliable threat intelligence, and then responding promptly as needed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Step 7: Monitor network and user behavior to identify and investigate security incidents in a timely manner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is imperative that organizations maintain an understanding not only of external threats but also of potential internal threats. Internal threats often stem from unauthorized data access. To determine whether internal incidents are threats or not, it's important to consider the context in which corporate data is accessed. For example, an abundance of Skype traffic in the sales team's network is probably a normal part of operations, but a burst in Skype traffic in the database server that houses a customer list is likely an indicator of a security issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Monitoring user behavioral patterns also helps determine whether an anomalous incident should be considered a threat. An example of a tool that does this is NetFlow, which provides high-level trends related to what protocols are used, identifies which hosts use the protocol, and calculates the associated bandwidth usage. When used in conjunction with a SIEM, users can orchestrate alerts to be sent whenever NetFlow goes above or below certain thresholds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Step 8: Have a documented and practiced incident response plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To meet GDPR's 72-hour breach notification rule, organizations need threat detection controls and processes in place to alert them to incidents, but they also need a data breach response plan that allows them to quickly and accurately determine the scope of impact. The first steps of the response plan should focus on investigating all related events to establish a timeline and determine the source of the attack and the steps needed to contain the incident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a good idea to prioritize - and document - all response and remediation tactics, as organizations will be required to inform regulators of all steps taken.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Step 9: Have a communication plan in place to notify relevant parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, upon completion of these steps, organizations should evaluate whether personal data was breached to determine if reporting is required under GDPR. If so, the notification that organizations are required to send to the regulatory body within 72 hours must include all of the following:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Simplifying GDPR</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Preparing for GDPR can seem like a daunting task, but organizations that follow the above steps and are equipped with the right security tools and strategies can rise to the challenge and strengthen their security - particularly their threat detection and response abilities - significantly along the way.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What happens when a cookie of a Brit in London lands in the server of a community bank in the U.S. if, on an off-chance, the Brit browses the bank's website?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's unclear, experts say, but U.S. banks - especially small and midsize banks - need to go find out because the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) could affect them, unlike the EU privacy regulations before it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The countdown is ticking on GDPR'swebsite. The law, approved by the European Parliament in April 2016, will take effect in late May 2018. It will apply to &quot;all companies processing and holding the personal data of data subjects residing in the European Union, regardless of the company's location,&quot; the website said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Basically any institution around the world that has an EU citizen, a European subject, is subject to the law,&quot; said Steve Ehrlich, lead analyst for emerging technologies at Spitzberg Partners LLC, a corporate advisory firm. &quot;An EU subject doesn't have to be a customer or employee.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The law can apply even if the company does not have a European business arm, said Pam Dingle, principal technical architect at Ping Identity, a firm that helps companies manage their personnel's identification needs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of GDPR's provisions will require banks to behave differently than under existing U.S. regulations. One example is that banks need to report data breaches to authorities within 72 hours of their discovery. &quot;That's not a lot of time,&quot; Dingle said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Large banks are already familiar with the law, said Andy Roth, partner at the law firm Cooley LLP, who focuses on legal issues surrounding new technology. But smaller banks &quot;are just recognizing that they have a potential exposure&quot; and &quot;are now starting to understand what they need to do to get in compliance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GDPR also requires companies to provide clients with full access to data about themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A European data subject can make requests on what data the bank has on it, and can make changes and request deletion of the data,&quot; said Roth, who is a former chief privacy officer at American Express. &quot;These require business practices that banks don't have in the U.S.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Companies with multiple legacy systems will face one of the toughest challenges, Dingle said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The first problem you will have when you deal with GDPR is that you have to somehow be able to reconcile how the data flows between all these different databases, even though they were made in different times, they may have different formats and the data might be called something different,&quot; she said. &quot;That's why a lot of these beautiful ideas of GDPR are very difficult in reality for people to execute on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Employees' attitudes toward personally identifiable information need to change, too, Dingle said. Simple things such as exporting company data to a spreadsheet so one can work at home can put customer data at risk, she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When found in violation of GDPR, a firm can be fined 2% or 4% of revenue. &quot;There's real enforcement risk,&quot; Roth said. That said, Roth and Ehrlich agreed that fines are higher for the worst offenders, while first-time violators face less risk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unlike some U.S. regulations, GDPR is not a law that banks can just say they substantially comply with, Ehrlich said, because compliance for GDPR needs to be demonstrated through documentation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roth agreed, saying that GDPR drives companies to develop documentation ahead of time - &quot;not waiting for something to happen and then investigate it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While larger banks are on the way to compliance, many community banks are assessing whether the law will apply to them, and what needs to be done, Roth said. Both Ehrlich and Roth said whether a small bank falls under GDPR is a case-by-case issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some matters, such as the browser-cookie question, are open to interpretation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ehrlich said most banks &quot;would be subject to GDPR because the definition of privacy is changing&quot; and cookies can be within its purview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Roth said that &quot;merely having a website that allows a few users to come from Europe, I'm not sure that it triggers the requirement.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Community banks lack in-house experts who understand what GDPR means for them, said Ehrlich.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guidance from the regulators on compliance will be anticipated, said a community banker who spoke on condition of anonymity. His bank has been assessing where it falls short of GDPR standards, and reaching out to federal regulators, vendors and consultants to gauge the potential impact of the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GDPR can be a challenge for community banks, but it could also be an opportunity, Ehrlich and Roth said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Larger banks have evolved to focus on data, and they understand how important data and the proprietary advantages in data are, especially in the digital world,&quot; Roth said. Community banks have been less focused on data, he said. &quot;It is one of the thingssmaller banks need to do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AHarvard Business Reviewarticle in 2016 said that banks have achieved higher sales and growth from extensive analysis of their customers' data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clients are willing to trade their information if they can get equitable return, and they feel they have control over their data, Ehrlich said. &quot;For banks, it can be anything from a higher interest rate, or loyalty program, or prepaid gift card.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Privacy concerns will rise with the advent of the internet of things, since smart devices will be able to collect large amount of personal information, Ehrlich said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">USAArecently joinedCapital One, American Express and some other financial institutions to offer virtual assistant service on Alexa, Amazon's artificial-intelligence-powered voice interactive device.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the internet of things becomes predominant, &quot;people are going to be very interested in what data is being collected about them and for what purposes,&quot; Ehrlich said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While not all banks may be affected by GDPR, privacy practices in the EU and the U.S. do overlap, Roth said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Banks &quot;should focus on operational risk management and information governance because these are unifying across the schemes,&quot; Roth said. &quot;That's the best thing they can do for themselves in the future.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Equifax's recent breach may be just a drop in the data-breach bucket by the end of 2017, according to new research out this week from digital security company Gemalto.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Amsterdam-based company reported that 918 data breaches compromised 1.9 billion data records worldwide during the first six months of this year - a rate that works out to more than 10 million records a day and 122 records every second. Overall, the number of records exposed rose 164% in the first half of the year, it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the most part, malicious outsiders were to blame for the breaches, but the data also suggested that malicious insiders are a growing threat: The number of records they compromised ballooned over 4,000% in the first half of the year to 20 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The alarming rise in data breaches isn't happening everywhere, however. Europe only had 49 data breaches in the first six months of the year and actually experienced a 35% drop from the previous six months, Gemalto reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Traditionally, North America has always had the largest number of publicly disclosed breaches and associated record numbers, although this is poised to change in 2018 when global data privacy regulations like the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and Australia's Privacy Amendment (Notifiable Data Breaches) Act are enforced,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Equifax breach, arguably one of the most controversial in recent years, seems to have reignited a push among credit union industry leaders here in the United States for tougher regulations on companies that possess personal data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among them is New York Credit Union Association president/CEO William J. Mellin, who said in a scathing public statement Tuesday that the breach highlights the need for tougher state-level cybersecurity standards if Congress does not create federal data-protection standards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Equifax data breach and their bungled response yet again underscore the need for a robust cybersecurity framework at the federal level. The bottom line is, what we're doing now from a cybersecurity standpoint is just not working,&quot; he stated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Far too often we are seeing the same reaction from organizations that have failed to adequately protect consumers' data: a press release that's light on details released long after the breach was discovered; a year of free credit monitoring; and an apology and a commitment to do better. That's no longer enough,&quot; Mellin added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mellin called for uniform standards for managing confidential information and better recourse for credit unions that bear the recovery costs of data breaches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Every business and entity that collects or stores this type of information should be subject to the same strict standards. And if Congress cannot act unilaterally to solve the gaping holes in our nation's cyber-infrastructure, then the state of New York should,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gemalto's research comes on the heels of similar findings released in July by Richmond, Virginia-based cyberanalytics firm Risk Based Security. It found that the total number of records compromised in the first half of 2017 due to data breaches is already higher than all of 2016.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The General Data Protection Regulation is now EU law and will come into effect on May 25, 2018, bringing with it a host of challenges for organizations throughout the world. While the law is termed &quot;general,&quot; it might more accurately be called &quot;global.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No matter where a company is headquartered, if it holds data on EU citizens, non-compliance could result in steep fines. With due diligence, thesefines, which can add up to over $20 Million or 4 percent of a company's annual global turnover, can be avoided. However, the challenges are multifaceted and include the need for compliance both internally as well as working with service providers that are also adhering to the provisions of GDPR.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vetting the ability of service providers to comply with GDPR before engaging them is a great way to get a jump start on ensuring a company's entire compendium of data is up to scratch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Getting your own house in order isn't enough</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GDPR replaces the pre-social media Data Protection Directive, and seeks to enshrine into law EU citizens' right to control how personal data is stored, processed, and shared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the most discussed provisions of GDPR is Article 17 - Right to Erasure - commonly referred to as the &quot;right to be forgotten.&quot; Under this requirement, individuals have the right to have personal data erased and to prevent processing in specific circumstances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For individual companies, the need to work with a cloud service provider that has standards in place to handle these erasure requests is essential for ensuring their own compliance. Working with a cloud provider that makes submitting erasure requests easy allows companies to avoid bottlenecks in responding to requests that are out of their control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An even more important consideration is the potential risks emerging from a company's use of cloud-based tools. For example, a company using a cloud-based collaboration tool might inadvertently put user data in an unsecured position. Without measures in place to address GDPR requirements, something as simple as a sensitive cloud-hosted document viewed on an employee's smartphone could be problematic under the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Collaboration tools are just a sliver of the cloud services that companies need to consider. Today, rather than storing business-critical data like customer transactions on-premises, many companies store data on more flexible cloud platforms like Amazon Web Services (AWS). Data analytics is increasingly moving to the cloud as well, with compute as well as storage functions on platforms not directly under a company's control. All are potentially subject to GDPR regulations (and fines for non-compliance).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In many cases, even careful, compliant, and secure companies can find their users' data somewhat haphazardly strewn across the internet on cloud platforms, which is a situation that EU regulators clearly have both a shrinking tolerance for, and the regulatory muscle to combat across oceans and borders. With the prevalence of cloud-based tools in business today and the massive, wide-ranging data footprint that comes with them, companies must thoroughly vet their cloud service providers' own compliance standards to be sure they're also staying compliant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How to vet your cloud service providers</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Below are key indicators your cloud services are ready for GDPR:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Nitty gritty details are a good sign. The best way to be sure your cloud service providers are taking GDPR seriously and not putting your business at risk is to only work with providers that make the details of their readiness explicit from the beginning. GDPR outlines these details in Article 25 (&quot;Privacy by Design and Default&quot;), which can help to determine if these services are built from the ground up to meet the rigorous personal data privacy guidelines of the GDPR. For example, cloud services should be able to address the access, rectification, and erasure rights of users.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. EU Citizen Data should be easily identifiable. Cloud providers that are compliant with GDPR will be able to show that they have the ability to segregate access or isolate EU citizen data so that only authorized and GDPR trained staff have access to that data. Ideally, cloud providers deliver the flexibility to store EU citizen data in datacenters physically located in the EU, or have partnerships with firms that provide that capability</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Search Performance and retrieval performance is critical. Cloud providers must be able to respond quickly to EU citizen inquiries who believe that their personal information may have been used inappropriately (Article 15 - &quot;Right of Access&quot;). Meeting this requirement is time sensitive, and providers must have the functional capabilities to quickly search and retrieve information - regardless of how much data they have stored.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aswe sawat ILTACON17, GDPR provides an opportunity for firms and services providers to demonstrate that they take data privacy seriously. With the amount of data that lives in the cloud today, a good service provider can help take some serious compliance pressure off your own shoulders; equally, a bad one could be an expensive nightmare.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the attention that the pending General Data Protection Regulation is getting, a significant number of organizations are still ill-prepared for GDPR and are unsure if they meet the criteria for compliance.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is the finding of a new survey of more than 1,600 organizations conducted by independent market research firm Vanson Bourne, which found widespread confusion about GDPR compliance criteria and an overall lack of preparation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The results show that a staggering 37 percent of respondents simply don't know whether their organization needs to comply with GDPR, while 28 percent believe they don't need to comply at all,&quot; the study revealed. Respondents in the UK appear better informed than their American counterparts, with 25 percent of &quot;~don't knows' and just 13 percent under the impression that they do not need to comply.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the GDPR criteria, any company that stores or processes personal information about EU citizens must demonstrate compliance. Of the respondents who don't believe the law applies to their organization, one in seven collect personal data from EU citizens, while 28 percent of respondents unsure about compliance also said that they collect this type of information, the study noted. The results suggest that many organizations are misinterpreting which types of data constitute a mandate for compliance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Once enforcement for this new legislation begins, companies all over the world will feel its impact. Unfortunately, the data shows that an alarming number of organizations are still unaware or mistaken about the need for GDPR compliance, leaving them three steps behind at this stage,&quot; said Corey Nachreiner, chief technology officer at WatchGuard, which sponsored the study.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the Americas, just 16 percent of organizations believe they need to comply. With sensitive customer data and non-compliance fines at stake, every company with access to data from European citizens needs to ensure they truly understand GDPR and its ramifications,&quot; Nachreiner said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lack of Preparation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While many organizations have been aware of GDPR for some time, just 10 percent of respondents - including those in the UK - believe their company is currently 100 percent ready, the study revealed. Another 44 percent of respondents stated that they don't know how close their organization is to compliance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of those who reported that their organization needs to comply with GDPR (35 percent of total respondents), the majority (86 percent) believe they have a solid compliance strategy in place. But, 51 percent of those respondents believe that their organization will need to make significant changes to their IT infrastructure in order to comply.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The implementation of the EU's General Data Protection Regulation on May 25, 2018 will have ramifications for organizations around the world. In fact, it will require more than 9,000 U.S. firms to hire a data protection officer, or DPO, to ensure its strict data protection regulations are met.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What exactly is a DPO?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a brand new role that will be responsible for educating a company and its employees on the requirements of GDPR, training staff involved in data processing and conducting regular security audits across the organization. The DPO will also serve as the main point of contact between the company and the supervisory authorities overseeing activities related to data collection or processing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the idea of the DPO role - and the role itself - is introduced to organizations, executive teams and board members will have to ask themselves a few very important questions before the GDPR legislation takes effect in May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Does the organization need a DPO on board?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A DPO will be required within all public organizations (government agencies or other entities). Additionally, any organization processing data requiring systematic monitoring of subjects on a large scale - or processing special categories of sensitive personal data such as health, religion, race, sexual orientation, and personal data relating to criminal convictions and offenses - will need one. If an organization processes and manipulates personal data (e.g. banks, healthcare, credit companies), it will need to hire a DPO. However, you likely will not need one if it only has HR data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Should the DPO be a member of the organization now?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether an organization is required to hire a DPO or not, bringing one in may be a sound decision. Whoever is hired for the role doesn't need to be a member of the organization, but the expertise of any external DPO must align with a business' data processing operations and the level of data protection required for the personal data processed by data controllers and data processors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What skills are needed for the role?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finding someone with the right blend of experience will be challenging. The role will require a rare combination of skills including an understanding IT, operations, data security, data protection laws and practices. The ideal DPO will be someone with a personality that lends itself well to building a culture of data protection combined with the expertise of a Chief Compliance Officer along with certain skills of a CISO or CTO. Think of the DPO as a free safety in football - it's a role that will require versatility, to say the least.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since finding the right fit may take time, organizations should consider a candidate who comes close to fitting the bill and helping them to close whatever gaps exist by offering the proper certifications and training in advance of the GDPR enforcement date.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How does an organization find the right DPO?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Organizations would be smart to begin evaluating potential DPO candidates as soon as possible to determine if they meet the requirements while being a valuable addition to the GDPR stakeholder team. Are there any candidates already working within the organization that can fill this need? Assessing the internal team and talent is a good first place to look, as they will have the best understanding of the business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The DPO will need to understand the company's existing data sources and examine what types of personal data - particularly GDPR-regulated data - is being collected, handled and stored. To do that, they will want to conduct a visibility assessment to best understand risk exposure and prioritize compliance efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What else does an organization need to know?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whatever technologies are implemented to support this effort, it will be critical to first understand how they enable personal data to be processed. Controls must then be placed around that data - e.g. implicit consent (opt-in), the right to be forgotten, transparency, pseudonymisation and data portability - as end users have the right to receive documentation of how their personal data is being used and stored. Additionally, use of the data can be audited and shouldn't be different than what the user opted in for. If usage changes, a company must notify the user and allow them to opt-out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GDPR is intentionally vague about how it prescribes solutions or technologies to achieve the necessary data controls and protection. The legislation was designed to be flexible in how it requires organizations and their DPOs to comply with its technology mandates. To best accommodate new and emerging technologies, like cloud-based systems, IoT and machine learning, specifications were kept open-ended. A potential negative effect however, is that this leaves many companies with little guidance as to what technologies can help them get in step with GDPR's requirements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Preparing for GDPR now will allow ample time for testing and assessing the new protocols, hiring the right DPO and ensuring they are operating effectively. Aligning an organization to GDPR in advance of the May 25 deadline may seem like a daunting task, but getting the right DPO in place can help ease the pressure companywide to prevent potential financial and regulatory consequences down the line.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A growing number of organizations are investing in big data deployments, and more of them are reporting success with those efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those are among the findings of anew studyby Progress Software that looked at the rate of adoption of big data projects, and how organizations are typically rating their experiences with big data. According to Sumit Sarkar, chief data evangelist at Progress, more than 1,200 business and information technology professionals were surveyed for the study, the &quot;2017 Progress Data Connectivity Outlook.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Information Management spoke with Sarkar about the study findings, including how data security issues and the pending General Data Protection Regulation will impact big data strategies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Information Management: Your research shows an increase in big data adoption among organizations from 50 percent to 61 percent. How do organizations typically rate their big data deployments?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sumit Sarkar: Based on the demographics of our audience, positive responses signal a mature deployment that is proving business value since they're investing in commercial data connectivity for enhanced performance and enterprise security. This was not the case a number of years ago when the majority of organizations were kicking the tires on Hadoop, and not yet ready to incorporate it into the enterprise wide data infrastructure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IM: The number one reported challenge is dealing with the growing number of data sources that organizations must manage. Specifically how does this make things more challenging, and what are organizations trying to do to improve that?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sarkar: The majority of data teams, comprised of data engineers, data scientists and data analysts, are highly skilled. However their ability to produce business insights is based on access to data. In addition to more data sources, we're seeing changes in the surface area of APIs, limited access to databases and an increasing number of firewall boundaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The inability to access this data limits the success of the entire investment in data analytics, and organizations are looking to adopting interoperable industry standards for SQL (ODBC, JDBC) and REST (OData) to provide data teams frictionless data access.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IM: How does the growing number of these data sources impact the data security efforts of organizations?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sarkar: Each new data source introduces additional complexity with encryption levels, authentication methods and workflows. In addition, many organizations need to factor in identity management and data lineage to track data access for regulators across different industries and government entities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then there is the threat of security breaches making organizations increasingly risk averse which makes it challenging to adopt the latest disruptive technology on day one which is represented in the survey as technologies consolidate and get enterprise ready over time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IM: You cite that 66 percent of respondents must comply with data protection laws. Do you have any sense of how the GDPR will impact organizations in this regard?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sarkar: We're seeing a large number of data ingestion from SaaS applications that store personal data that is subject to GDPR. In fact, the largest amount of source data being accessed in our DataDirect Cloud service is from sales and marketing SaaS applications, and their adoption ranks highly in the survey responses. We expect organizations will need to start monitoring the user roles and API usage from these SaaS applications to ensure compliance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Equifax - one of three major credit-reporting companies in the US - announced a breach last week affecting 143 million customers in the US, as well as customers in Canada and the UK. Compounding the damage, the press and security experts haveuniversally pannedthe company's response.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fallout is, as expected, widespread. It includes calls for legislation, lawsuits, and a mountain of bad PR. Yet, this is just another example - albeit a major one - of poor stewardship of customer information and private data.Experian, another of the big three credit agencies, exposed the data of millions of customers in 2015. The same year, Chinese hackers breached the Office of Personal Management (OPM), and the FBIjust announcedan arrest in that case. A new breach makes headlines seemingly every week, if not every day.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outside the US, and especially in Europe, Lawmakers are taking action to protect consumer data. The upcoming General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a major piece of regulation affecting any organization doing business with EU Citizens. Effective May 25, 2018, GDPR includes huge penalties for non-compliance (up to 4 percent of annual revenues or 20 million Euros - whichever is more). Under GDPR - Equifax would face a potential fine of more than $60 million. With teeth like this, organizations must take GDPR seriously and prepare accordingly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Per a Guidance Software survey from earlier this year, only 15.7 percent of companies reported reaching the advanced planning stages for GDPR. Twenty-four percent of organizations - a full one-in-four - already acknowledge that they will not be ready by the May 2018 deadline. GDPR includes many serious requirements. For example, it requires that organizations report a breach within 72 hours of discovery. Equifax waited well over a month. Organizations behind in planning and those taking a wait-and-see approach are taking a calculated risk, and a substantial one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Survey data also shows that organizations are poorly equipped to understand - much less manage data. Of companies surveyed with $1 billion or more in revenues, just 43 percent have processes in place to identify data records of any EU citizen and determine where that data is processed. Moreover, it is significantly worse for organizations with less than $100 million in sales at just 26.8 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Make no mistake about it: these breaches will continue to happen and make headlines.Our research foundthat a quarter of respondents suffered direct financial losses due to a cyberattack in the past year. The number organizations reporting &quot;significant financial losses&quot; tripled Y-o-Y, and almost two-thirds fell victim to malware-related breaches. We're in a new reality where it's not a matter of if your company will be attacked, but when.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some security officers are unsure of how best to proceed with a regulation that has such massive implications and administrative challenges. We recommend following these four steps to get started.</SPAN></P>

</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Equifax incident, when viewed through the lens of the upcoming GDPR regulation, serves as a stark reminder for organizations that they need to prepare for the inevitable breach. Preparing for GDPR is an opportunity for every organization to take the right steps to identify what sensitive data they have, determine how it should be secured, and create a process for how they will respond when an attack occurs. Starting with the steps above, security professionals can be confident they have done everything in their power to keep customers' data safe. Organizations that take GDPR seriously will also be better prepared to avoid heavy fines and reputational damage, and well positioned should the US and other countries look to expand their own regulations dealing with privacy and cybersecurity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The recently-revealed Equifax data breach impacts 143 million people, and with the General Data Protection Regulation set to take effect in only seven months, this is not good news.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The theft and or compromising of vital information is becoming a fairly common phenomenon. This tends to be a two-pronged issue, there are threats from outside the company and there are also rogue actors lurking within the organization's firewalls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Companies such as Equifax that store PII (personally identifiable information) find themselves especially susceptible to attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While most organizations like Equifax have hardened their perimeter and put in infrastructure-centric measures to thwart hackers from the outside, to date, little has been done to effectively inventory, secure, manage and dispose of data/information in the enterprise. In Equifax's case, hackers were able to compromise and penetrate a webserver and web application to abscond the data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Specifically, a Zero-Day vulnerability related to Struts2 that was made public last week. In addition to the first Zero Day, more severe Zero Day exploits appeared late last week. These exploits leave web applications vulnerable to remote execution of code and create a conduit for direct access to data stores (in Equifax's case the data store was PII for 143 million people).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is self-evident that we live in a global economy and the threats are both exponential and global. With the advent of outsourcing and offshoring, data theft/data compromise are existing risks that organizations must mitigate against. The challenges they face relate to the increasing amount of data (the 3Vs - Volume, Variety and Velocity) that proliferate across systems across the globe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Additionally, this hack also contained personally identifying information of European and Canadian Citizens. When GDPR comes into effect in May 2018, organizations such as Equifax face fines of 4 percent of annual revenues as a consequence of breaches such as this adding to both the cost and risk of contending with the breach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In my view, companies must adopt good information management practices along with modern technologies and platforms to effectively thwart bad actors. The way to achieve that is to identify, inventory, curate and manage sensitive data through its lifecycle using modern, open platforms.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a shockingly understated comment on what is probably the largest data breach in history, Equifax's CEO Richard Smith said, &quot;This is clearly a disappointing event for our company, and one that strikes at the heart of who we are and what we do. I apologize to consumers and our business customers for the concern and frustration this causes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Piling insult on injury, Equifax is now in the midst of a PR disaster as the company is only divulging whether a person's PII has been breached by asking them todivulge their PII, enrolling in Equifax's Trusted ID Premier serviceand incredibly, waiving the ability to bring or participate in a &quot;class action, class arbitration or other representative action.&quot; This may be very wishful thinking on behalf of Equifax - aproposed class action was filed last nightover a breach that affects up to143 million U.S. consumers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it's not just Equifax that needs to worry. The incident can and should be a turning point for the financial services industry that it needs to end its reliance on static personal identifiers like Social Security numbers and birth dates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A history of fraudulence</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For too long, consumers have been told to guard their personal information as if they were the ones in control of it. Ahead of theTarget data breach of November 2014, consumers with crystal balls could have avoided shopping at the store, but it's a nigh impossible task for any banked consumer to hide from the three major credit bureaus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And thesize and frequency of data breaches has acceleratedto a point where it could be argued that consumers see this as the new normal. Even so, the Equifax breach may be so significant in scale and reach - affecting up to 44% of the U.S. population - that it does actually precipitate a change in the way that PII is protected and stored.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The public certainly has breach fatigue, but the size of this one will resonate, along with the fact that it involves people's full identities.&quot; said Julie Conroy, research director at Aite Group. &quot;It's a lot more challenging and painful for consumers to unwind the resulting identity theft-related fraud than a breach just involving payment card data like Target or Home Depot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This incident may move the needle from passive to active identity management, according to a senior bank executive who requested to remain anonymous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today's identity management infrastructure is passive, identity checks or identity updates happen in the background,&quot; the executive said. &quot;We need to reverse that. Every time some provider wants to add to your identity data/change it, you need to be notified and can agree or not agree with the change. App ecosystems are doing this, why not credit bureaus?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opting in to a better future</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The app ecosystem has learned the hard way that older identity verification methods don't translate well to the modern world. Apple was a pioneer in the app economy and suffered the consequences - includinga $32 million settlementwith the FTC - over lax authentication policies for in-app purchases. The company went on to make fingerprint authentication and tokenization a standard of mobile payments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outside of the mobile environment, there is a similar need for technology to catch up with reality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hopefully this builds momentum behind better means of authentication - passive methods (e.g., device ID, geolocation, behavior-metrics), dynamic knowledge-based authentication, mobile imaging of IDs (which can detect embedded holograms), and biometrics,&quot; said Dan Van Dyke, senior analyst at BI Intelligence. &quot;Static identifiers are now undeniably dead.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has been noted that the backbone of the credit card industry in the U.S. has been in place since the 1960s and has almost certainly not kept up to speed with the digital world of today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The whole system relies on static information held by old, stale companies,&quot; said Kaz Nejatian, CEO of the alternative payments network Kash. &quot;Anyone who deals with fraud can tell you that this system is totally broken. This latest hack, hopefully, will force everyone to take a long, hard look at the technology foundations for banking&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, there may not be a way to abruptly change the way the financial services industry handles identity verification and other uses of PII, even if efforts start today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Changing the paradigm around identity is more of an evolutionary path than a revolutionary one, since there are so many interconnected dependencies, especially in highly regulated environments that rely on PII,&quot; Conroy said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Watching the watchers</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A breach of this magnitude is also shining a renewed regulatory spotlight on credit reporting firms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his statement of last night, Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., who heads the bipartisan Senate Cybersecurity Caucus, went on to say that the Equifax breach &quot;raises serious questions about whether Congress should not only create a uniform data breach notification standard, but also whether Congress needs to rethink data protection policies, so that enterprises such as Equifax have fewer incentives to collect large, centralized sets of highly sensitive data like SSNs and credit card information on millions of Americans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, this may be a failing of government as much as it is a failing of the financial services industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How regulators have allowed this situation to persist for this long is utterly baffling,&quot; said Scott Crawford, research director at 451 Research. &quot;At a time when many enterprises are scrambling to become compliant with more stringent data protection requirements outside the U.S. such as GDPR, the U.S. seems positively backward in its approach - embarrassingly so when it comes to the PII handled by credit reporting firms.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This particular breach could have even further reaching consequences not just in the exposure data that is released, but in the data that may have been put in. In a nightmare scenario for the credit scoring industry, this could undermine the validity of FICO.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am really way more worried about the new data hackers created than the stuff they took out,&quot; Nejatian said. &quot;Imagine them creating ten thousands of people out of thin air, all with perfect FICOs and all of them now applying for loans on these online, no-branch shops.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vol. 1</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">No. 1</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1064  words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Collaboration, integration, systemization. It's easy to pass over words like these, peppered throughout the marketing literature for a vast array of software and services. Not to mention, these words tend to represent a lot of messy work, at least initially. Anyone who has ever been in charge of getting a slew of departments to work together to adopt new processes will get a headache just thinking about it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the complex and overlapping challenges of regulatory, technological and business governance are snowballing. It's clear that traditional, manual approaches to essential obligations like compliance reporting are inefficient at best. In many cases, the lack of interdepartmental collaboration, data integration and process systemization are actually increasing enterprise risk and slowing progress toward strategic objectives.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his report &quot;Transform Governance, Risk and Compliance to Integrated Risk Management,&quot; Gartner analyst John A. Wheelerhighlights a findingfrom a 2016 survey of risk executives by the Risk and Insurance Management Society: nearly three-quarters of the respondents claimed that forecasting critical risks would be increasingly difficult for the next three years, and the main obstacle is the ongoing lack of &quot;cross-organization collaboration.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Individual data governance procedures may work well for the departments that designed and customized them, but from a wider enterprise view they hinder data sharing, accountability and visibility. In the era of big data analytics and automated business intelligence, polarization and siloed efforts are a waste of opportunity, not to mention time and resources. Without centralized data management, processes are duplicative and inconsistent, leading to reporting generated from incomplete or outdated data sets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Miscommunication complicates already burdensome compliance activities as departmental processes overlap or reverse the work of other business units. When boards and executives can't rely on quality, comprehensive reports and analyses, corporate initiatives and enterprise risk management efforts suffer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Frameworks and standards such as NIST, HIPAA, PCI DSS, and the ISO 27000 series have increasingly focused their guidance on risk management, especially when it comes to data governance and cyber security. Emerging requirements like GDPR, as well as overarching trends like geopolitics, climate change, globalization, cloud computing, and IoT introduce new risks and governance/compliance challenges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the interdependence between third party risk, operational risk, and IT risk increases, leading companies are turning to integrated risk management systems (IRMS) supported by governance, risk management, and compliance (GRC) technology.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Implemented enterprise-wide, these solutions facilitate compliance reporting (and many other essential functions) by centralizing data management and introducing process efficiencies through automation. Processes are integrated and streamlined so they become consistent and repeatable; workflows ensure they are traceable, repeatable and predictable. All communications, assessments and remediation activities are documented and stored centrally so that everyone is on the same page.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Risk profiles are more complete and business decisions are based on data-driven, holistic reporting. Likewise, companies are able to streamline audit preparation and experience a more efficient audit. Critical insights into potential hazards, historical trends, and root causes can be gleaned through advanced analytics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most importantly, centralized data governance and reporting reduces enterprise and IT risk. By linking processes and resources together for more thorough and prioritized coverage, GRC solutions make better use of existing IT tools and data streams. Tighter integration between departments, systems and processes helps avoid incidents, and when the inevitable breach occurs, ensures that incident response protocols are well coordinated and expeditious.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The enhanced visibility and responsiveness that results from IRMS/GRC implementation is particularly compelling in light of the work involved in governing personal data and complying with PII/PHI requirements. Across an enterprise or value chain, many departments and third parties will handle sensitive personal data on many different systems, for a wide variety of purposes. However, tracking each use of protected data and collating reports without GRC tools is time-intensive and error-prone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For instance, ananalysisof a recent Veritas survey highlighted the stark disparity between organizations' perception of GDPR readiness and their actual compliance with specific provisions. Sixty-one percent of the organizations that claimed to be compliant also stated it would be difficult to report a data breach within 72 hours of awareness, which is a key requirement in breaches that put data subjects at risk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gartner's delineation ofintegrated risk management attributesencompasses strategy, assessment, response, communication and reporting, monitoring and technology. Implementing this approach certainly requires the messy but rewarding work of collaboration, integration and systemization, but comprehensive GRC solutions provide a central grounding point from which to start or mature, and purpose-built tools for establishing connections, assigning workflows, and bringing efficiencies to labor-intensive processes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having a comprehensive picture of risk across business units, partners and vendors is good for business. It informs strategic decisions at the highest levels, keeps operations humming along, and protects investments in people, process and technology. Mature, enterprise-wide compliance programs can shape and strengthen quality, culture, security, corporate responsibility, brand reputation and more. In the past, this level of compliance maturity has been attainable only at a steep cost.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the support of GRC solutions, day-to-day tasks of monitoring, tracking and documenting can be automated, leaving leaders and teams with more time for higher-level activities. Compliance becomes significantly more efficient and meaningful. As part of an integrated risk approach, it builds resilience and allows organizations to increase their risk appetite. Combined, these benefits put companies at an advantage over competitors and create a solid foundation for growth and change.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">C-3PO tends to be most people's first representation of a super smart robot. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Star Wars'</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> beloved&nbsp;protocol droid acts&nbsp;very much as an individual, with its own distinct personality. The films never address the question, but C-3PO's intellgence appears to reside entirely on the droid's CPU.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But when artificially intelligent machines become prevalent here in the real world, they won't work like that at all.&nbsp;Self-driving cars won't really drive themselves. They will be driven largely by brains in the cloud.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. House of Representative's unanimously passed a bill this week offered by Ohio's Rep. Bob Latta, greenlighting the deployment of autonomous vehicles. Key leaders in the Senate have expressed an appetite for such legislation, but its language on riders' privacy looks inadequate some advocates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All the cars' many sensors will beam information gathered directly to online navigation systems. That's piles of data about road conditions, weather and other cars on the road. Those logs can be directly associated with the people riding in the car. It's the simplest pieces of data about each trip that are probably the most revealing: where it started, where it ended and who was in the car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's a few instances when simple route information could reveal too much:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lots of trips taking place between two competing companies could suggest a merger deal underway,If one firm has lots of specialized accountants and lawyers visiting, that could indicate there's trouble on its books orIf one employee has taken multiple trips to another company's office, that could indicate that they are in talks to switch jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sound paranoid? It shouldn't, because we've seen it before.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Security researchers were able to easily identify individual taxi cabs in a pool of data about trips and fares collected by the New York Taxi and Limousine Commission. Then, by using images captured by photographers and social media, they could identify specific trips taken by celebrities&nbsp;(and how much they tipped).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Self-driving cars have a great deal of promise for mitigating traffic deaths, lowering the cost of transportation and reducing traffic, but they risk exposing people's secrets, too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Considering having an affair? Better buy a bicycle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The current version of the legislation requires all autonomous or partially autonomous vehicles to have a plan for the data that it collects about the people in its cars.&nbsp;The main protection it offers consumers is this: the company has to give them some idea of what it's doing with the data it gathers about them (including sharing it with other companies). It also requires the Federal Trade Commission to look into the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Privacy plans are not a substitute for privacy protections,&quot; Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center wrote the Observer in an email. EPIC issued a statement on the bill Thursday, noting in particular that the law preempts state law, making it impossible for forward-thinking states to hold vehicle makers to a higher standard (as California has consistently done with automobile emissions rules).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Senate will need to look at these issues more closely. Right now, autonomous vehicles are 'unsafe at any speed,'&quot; Rotenberg wrote (link added).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Verdi of the Future of Privacy Forum saw the legislation as a net positive. He wrote the Observer in an email, &quot;Connected cars are increasingly sitting in American driveways and operating on roadways. The privacy requirements are important first steps in ensuring that drivers' privacy is protected while they enjoy the massive potential safety and environmental benefits of connected vehicles.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Verdi added that leading automakers have signed onto voluntary principles that require them to seek affirmative consent for sharing more sensitive data. Which is good, but non-obligatory commitments could erode quickly as robot-driven rubber actually hits internet-connected roads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Privacy International helped us compare the SELF-DRIVE Act's standards to the basic privacy guidelines in Europe, under its General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which becomes enforceable next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Europe, privacy policies have to include a privacy impact assessment, according to&nbsp;Ailidh Callander, a legal officer with the organization, who emailed the Observer via a spokesperson. Such an assessment would require &quot;an assessment of the necessity and the proportionality of the processing and the risks to the rights and freedoms of the individual's whose data is being processed,&quot; she wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She noted several particular deficiencies in the American legislation. For example, it never addresses deletion of data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Privacy advocates tend to prefer for data to have a shelf life. But nothing in this legislation suggests that a record of your trip to the mini-mart ever needs to be deleted. And if it shares that data with a third party, who knows who else that company may share it with? In the end, it could be copied so many times that your embarrassing midnight ice cream run might never be lost to history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Callander added that consumers should have the ability to see the particulars of data carmakers collect, as well as the right to review, challenge and erase that data. Further, consumers should not simply be informed that data is shared, but how much of it, with which organizations and why.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lastly, Privacy International suggested that consumers should also have a way to contact someone at the company that collects data about their rides.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rep. Latta's office referred the Observer's questions about privacy to staff at the House Energy and Commerce Committee, chaired by Rep. Greg Walden, of Oregon. The chairman's office was not immediately available for comment. The legislation will need to be considered by the U.S. Senate before it can be sent to the White House for President Donald Trump's signature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">C-3PO can choose to keep to keep your secrets (even if Princess Leia only trusted R2-D2), but real world robots have no choice but to share. Once shared, secrets get stored.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday, we learned that 143 million Americans' sensitive personal information (the kind that enables identity theft) had been stolen from the credit reporting agency, Equifax. This follows breaches from Yahoo, Patreon and Ashley Madison, among many others. Even Facebook-owned Instagram let slip the contact information of its most famous users.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The private sector has proven a poor steward of very sensitive personal information, and it's not hard to understand why. Protecting and deleting customer data falls on the expense side of the ledger, but selling, sharing and using data, that's all potential revenue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With a rapidly changing regulatory environment driven by privacy concerns from major data breaches and a more scrutinizing focus on data protection, the EU's General Data Privacy Regulation has become front and center for the enterprise. While most have focused on the regulation as it's stated, one question remains the focus: what exactly, in reality, are the implications of GDPR? And how will they be enforced?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the GDPR being less than a year away, there's still a lot of uncertainty over how it will take effect, and how far organizations will have to go to ensure compliance. The requirements contain a degree of ambiguity that can be difficult to interpret, which means there is a whole spectrum of how companies could potentially react to it. How far do organizations truly have to go to avoid sanctions? Will a small mistake actually result in a 20 million EUR fine?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of the companies I've spoken with, some believe that their present data protection initiatives will pave the way for GDPR compliance, while others are scrambling to put more formidable policies and solutions in place. And yet still more are waiting to see how the rest of the world reacts before making any major moves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New Rules</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amidst a number of other requirements, at the regulation's core is the right to be forgotten, which manifests itself in the form of subject requests. A customer or employee has the right to request their personal data be deleted-or in other cases produced, amended, or relocated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To what degree organizations must actually fulfill such requests is yet to be seen, and will likely depend on the function of that data and the degree of disruption its deletion would cause. That said, if we've learned anything from similar regulations and the e-Discovery world in the past, reasonable justification for not complying may pass muster if there is good cause but the inability to respond is likely to be met with severe repercussions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We can't provide the data because&quot;&quot; may be just fine but &quot;We can't provide the data PERIOD&quot; will result in, well, a substantial fine or sanction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What really hits home for many data privacy stakeholders are not the regulation's subtle nuances, but rather the price tag it carries of up to 20 million EUR or 4 percent annual turnover. While this is certainly enough to drive market interest for a &quot;GDPR solution,&quot; the reality is there is no magic bullet; the regulation is purposefully written to preclude a check-the-box approach. Instead, organizations will benefit from a multifaceted approach that addresses and enables the people, processes, and technologies that are imperative to data privacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, where to begin?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Final Frontier of Data Management</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The organizations that have a strong grasp on the regulation are focusing initial efforts on their highest risk areas. For many companies, this comprises file shares, SharePoint, and other employee-created data. The reasons for this have a lot to do with the historical regulatory and legal emphasis on structured data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Organizations in regulated spaces typically already have processes in place for managing structured data, because it's been required for the past couple decades. Treating GDPR as something &quot;brand new&quot; across all data stores is simply a false premise; data protection laws have been in place since 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What has changed is the scope of the responsibility, which isn't just across structured systems (think HR systems, SAP, etc.) but across everything. That is the game changer, particularly as unstructured data has grown and continues to do so at an unprecedented and alarming rate - and is still largely ungoverned!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So coming back to &quot;Where do we start?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some organizations are, however, moving forward with initiatives to tame this wild west of unmanaged data, using a combination of in-place analysis and information governance. Initiatives often begin with:</SPAN></P>

<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Application of ongoing remediation policies and retention management&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ability to classify PII, employee data, business records, sensitive legal documents, and other important data lies at the heart of this process. This can only be done if you truly understand what you have, which most organizations do not. However, organizations that are able to shed light on these repositories can minimize exposure to the GDPR in a few different ways.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First, understanding where personal data is stored and indexing it enables an organization to more efficiently search for it and remediate it in the event of a subject access request.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Second, by deleting unnecessary data, organizations can reduce the amount of personal data they're responsible for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, keeping this unstructured data continuously managed through ongoing information governance is a critical last step.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Organizations that are able to govern repositories of employee-created documents also limit their exposure to risks such as data breach, which create additional GDPR risk. I compare this scenario to a home invasion: having home security is a great idea (your personal &quot;firewall&quot;), but once a burglar gets in, don't have all your crown jewels sitting out on the dining table and then wonder why or how you lost your gems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similarly, a firewall breach is, unfortunately, a matter of when and not if for the enterprise. Our best protection against that scenario is not just to harden the firewall but to secure our sensitive data so that in the event of a breach, that data isn't easily accessible or compromised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Privacy by Design</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ultimately, staying 100 percent compliant with the GDPR to the letter of the law might be near-impossible. Conflicts with business needs, e-Discovery, and other regulations will make the deletion of consumer and employee data upon request a fine line to walk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, the organizations that remain defensible will likely be the ones that make best efforts to instill privacy by design, or what might be referred to as systemic privacy. The GDPR compliance entails a comprehensive approach to data management and information governance, and for many organizations unstructured repositories are a good place to begin.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vol. 1</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">No. 1</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, has become top-of-mind for organizations around the world. Indeed, according toPwC's Preparedness Pulse Survey, 92 percent of organizations consider GDPR compliance a top priority on their data-privacy and security agenda, with over half saying it's &quot;the&quot; top priority and 38 percent saying it's &quot;among&quot; top priorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the 8 percent who don't consider it a priority, GDPR is a new privacy regulation in Europe that protects the personal data for any individual based in the European Union, regardless of citizenship or where the data is being held. It applies to any organization located inside or outside the EU if they offer goods or services to, or monitor the behavior of, EU data subjects.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This regulation will be enforced in May 2018 and outlines strict fines for those companies found to be out of compliance. With the deadline looming, now is the time for organizations to begin to establish a process for adhering to the necessary requirements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This regulation is not to be taken lightly and should be viewed as a mandate, versus a mere suggestion. Strict fines will be applied to those companies found to be out of compliance. With a maximum fine of &quot;up to 4 percent of annual global turnover for breaching GDPR or \xE2,\xAC20 million&quot; (whichever is higher), organizations of any size will be significantly impacted by non-compliance. Many organizations have already started down the path to compliance - but for those dragging their feet, time is running out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are four critical areas that companies need to be mindful of when mapping out their approach to GDPR compliance, otherwise known as &quot;The 4 Ps of GDPR&quot;: Policies, Procedures, Protocols and People.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Policies</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Right out of the gate, it will be important to identify a risk team to conduct a privacy assessment. This group should be tasked to evaluate and determine what specific data will fall under the regulation, where that data resides, and how that data moves through the system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once an inventory of all of the personal data a company handles is identified, establish a policy for what is to be done with that data to be in compliance with the regulation. You should be asking yourself:</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><UL CLASS="c9"><LI CLASS="c10"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"><NOBR>&bull;</NOBR></SPAN></P>
<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why are we collecting that data?&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
</LI><LI CLASS="c10"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"><NOBR>&bull;</NOBR></SPAN></P>
<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Does the data need to be retained?&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
</LI><LI CLASS="c10"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"><NOBR>&bull;</NOBR></SPAN></P>
<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Did an individual consent to the collection of their personal information?&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
</LI><LI CLASS="c10"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"><NOBR>&bull;</NOBR></SPAN></P>
<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Who has access to that data and why?&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There should also be a policy around proper security controls to prevent external or internal exposure of personal information. All potential risks should be categorized and that information should be relayed to data stewards or owners before a specific solution can be put in place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Procedures</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the GDPR umbrella, existing procedures for collecting and storing data will need to be adapted to become fully compliant. In some cases, this may require a complete overhaul of existing procedures. In others, it may be determined that the information that has been retained is now not required, thus eliminating some procedures altogether.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Examples of well established procedures that will need to be reexamined include: Informing individuals when and why personal data is collected; requesting that individuals give explicit consent to retain personal information; setting up additional user access roles to prevent non-essential people from viewing sensitive data; and enabling masking or encryption of data where necessary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protocol</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It will also be very important to develop a protocol that defines how you will will handle situations when individuals want to invoke GDPR. There are many areas to consider around this, including:</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><UL CLASS="c9"><LI CLASS="c10"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"><NOBR>&bull;</NOBR></SPAN></P>
<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Who will be responsible for handling inbound requests?&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
</LI><LI CLASS="c10"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"><NOBR>&bull;</NOBR></SPAN></P>
<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is the procedure for addressing said request?&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
</LI><LI CLASS="c10"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"><NOBR>&bull;</NOBR></SPAN></P>
<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What are the cases where information needs to be kept for legal, business or other reasons?&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Be sure that each area is thoroughly considered and the protocol is clearly communicated to all key stakeholders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Your greatest assets are your people. Don't leave them in the dark about this process. Educate your customers, vendors, and employees about GDPR and let them know about the policies, procedures and protocols that you are defining to safeguard their personal information. Let them know how much you value their privacy and your role as the custodian of their personal data. Be sure to give them peace of mind that you are taking the regulation seriously and approaching it carefully and swiftly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the end, they will thank you, and your organization can take solace in the fact that you are now in full compliance.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report, &quot;Data Protection Risks &amp; Regulations in the Global Economy,&quot; asked more than 550 IT security and compliance professionals to weigh in on the top global security risks, as well as how prepared they feel their companies are to respond to a global data breach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than half (51 percent) of companies surveyed had experienced a global data breach, with nearly 56 percent experiencing more than one breach in the past five years. Despite these major security intrusions, 32 percent of respondents said their companies still don't have a response plan in place.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only 30 percent of respondents said their C-suite executives are fully aware of the state of their companies' compliance with global regulations. In addition, only 38 percent said their senior leadership views compliance with global privacy and data protection regulations as a top priority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the looming regulations is the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Only 9 percent of respondents reported their organization is ready to comply with GDPR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Despite increasing reports of the damage caused by global data breaches, the study emphasizes that the increasing risk of, as well as the experience of going through, a global data breach isn't enough to lead CIOs and CSOs to prioritize compliance measures in line with what is expected in the GDPR,&quot; said Michael Bruemmer, vice president, Experian Data Breach Resolution.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Banks' adversaries in the debate over account data sharing have honed their talking points and gone on the offensive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Data aggregation companies and some fintech companies need consumers' bank account data for their business models and products to work. The aggregators make money by collecting account data and streaming it to other companies, usually fintechs but sometimes banks as well. The data is gathered either through screen scraping (logging in to an online banking service using the customer's username and password and copying and pasting the transaction information into a database) or through direct connections with the banks. Fintech companies, such as those that provide robo-advisers and personal financial management apps, also rely on this data to provide their services, and obtain it through data aggregators or their own screen-scraping or direct connection.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A recently formed group representing 31 data aggregators and fintech companies, called Consumer Financial Data Rights, says banks still aren't forking over as much data as they should be. The group is meeting with bank regulators to plead their case and trying to get consumers to petition regulators on their behalf, urging them to send a Tweet that says, &quot;.@CFPB protect Americans' ability to grant access to their financial information. #handsoffmyfinancialdata.&quot; In November 2016, the CFPB launched an inquiry into the challenges consumers face in accessing, using and securely sharing their financial records.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When you talk to bankers, fintech companies and data aggregators individually, you could get the impression they're all on the same page. They all claim to know what consumers want and to be the best champion of customers' rights and protectors of their data. All say they're in favor of open APIs for sharing data. And all say their motive is to help consumers. Yet each party appears to be primarily looking out for its own business interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The leaders of the CFDR accused banks of pushing bilateral agreements that restrict the types of data that will be shared and the use cases under which it can be shared. They also said large banks refuse to even talk with them about these issues. They say they would like to see the industry coalesce around a set of principles such as the European Union'sGeneral Data Protection Rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Just think about all the important advances in health care that depend upon your data, your DNA, your healthcare records,&quot; said Jon Stein, CEO of Betterment. &quot;If all that was owned by a single doctor and you didn't have the right to access that data, own that data, transfer it to another doctor if you wanted to, there would be a terrific outcry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Banks say they have no intention of restricting data sharing, that they want to let customers decide with whom their bank account data should be shared, and that they want to make sure that data is secure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I absolutely agree customers should have control over banking information,&quot; said Brett Pitts, head of digital for Wells Fargo Virtual Channels, when Wells announced its data-sharing agreement with Intuit. &quot;The security aspects of that are important to customers.&quot; In addition to Wells Fargo, BBVA Compass, Citi, Chase and Silicon Valley Bank have set up APIs for the purpose of sharing customer data with third parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similar spats are playing out in other industries. A judge this week ruled that LinkedIn must allow an analytics company called hiQ to continue to screen-scrape user profiles while hiQ sues LinkedIn for the permanent right to scrape its data. LinkedIn argues that hiQ's automated scraping tools harvest the personal information of users and organizations for free without their permission and illegally bypasses LinkedIn's anti-scraping protections. LinkedIn has formal data-sharing deals with several other analytics companies.There are several specific points of contention between the CFDR and the banks:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bilateral agreementsThe CFDR's top complaint about banks is that they are making one-off data-sharing agreements with data aggregators and fintechs. Chase and Wells Fargo both have announced recent agreements with Intuit and with Finicity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What's happening are bilateral agreements that have been developed by a few financial institutions that have very concerning elements: data restrictions around what consumers can see around their own data and use case restrictions,&quot; said Anil Arora, CEO of Envestnet Yodlee (the data aggregator Yodlee was sold to the wealth management software company Envestnet in 2015). &quot;And the technologies that are being proposed are inconsistent across banks, they're expensive, they're not scalable, they're one-off, in some cases they're less secure, and may even lead to unintended consequences.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For instance, Arora said banks are limiting the data a company like Betterment could use to provide analysis, advice and planning to its customers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The bank in its wisdom will decide what data fields can be passed on by the consumer and which ones cannot,&quot; he said. &quot;The data restrictions are pretty significant. Another restriction that's in there is what use cases are consumers permitted to share the applications for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Imagine that: We're basically saying to the consumer, You cannot make decisions about your own life in terms of how you're using the data, you have to have a third party bank decide what you can and cannot do with your data.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Further, each bank has a different set of restrictions, Arora said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Imagine the logistical and practical impact of fintech, technology and aggregation companies having to have a different set of data and restrictions with each bank on a one-off basis,&quot; Arora said. &quot;That breaks the entire model of how you then have these solutions and services run on top of these models, because they cannot work with inconsistent data.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wells Fargo and Chase executives declined requests for interviews for this story. In the past, they have said they can't comment on their agreements with data aggregators, referring to them as legal matters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As has always been the case, nothing is intended to constrain, but to provide data in a safe, transparent way that gives customers control,&quot; Pitts said in the earlier interview about Wells Fargo's agreement with Intuit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reselling customer data to third partiesAnother issue: What happens to data once it's shared with a data aggregator or fintech company?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yodleereportedlysells some of the bank and card transaction data it gathers to investors, research firms, and hedge funds such as Steven A. Cohen's Point72 for millions of dollars. The hedge funds mine the information for clues about trends that can move stock prices. This is antithetical to GDPR principles: The consumer is not being told what's happening with his data, nor being offered an opportunity to provide consent or opt out. There's no auditable trail of consent and permission around the use of the data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yodlee says it doesn't sell personally identifiable information; the data is all anonymized. Yetanonymized data can be de-anonymizedand &quot;bank details&quot; are specifically mentioned in the GDPR as data that needs to be protected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The large banks, especially Chase, say it's their policy not to resell customer data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Chase announced its data-sharing agreement with Intuit in January, the two companies stated they would not resell data to third parties. They said customers will give explicit consent to share their data with Intuit and for Intuit applications to use specific account information, and will be able to turn on and off access for Intuit applications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The most important part of this is giving control to the customer,&quot; Jamie Dimon, chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase, said in a statement at the time. &quot;Customers will get to decide what they want to share and when they want to share it - without having to hand over their password.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Secil Tabli Watson, executive vice president and head of digital solutions for business at Wells Fargo, pointed out in an interview early this summer that there are security issues with reselling customer data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Any data can be compromised, so you want to keep your data as secure as possible,&quot; she said. &quot;Just because it's anonymized, that doesn't mean there isn't value in there that you would lose if somebody was able to eavesdrop on it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dan Kimerling, head of API banking, open platform and research and development at Silicon Valley Bank, pointed out that it's hard to draw a line between legitimate reuses of data and dodgy ones. For instance, some card organizations resell transaction data for research purposes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If there's data, and there are data moats, somebody's going to want it and you're going to sell it,&quot; he said. &quot;There's always going to be a right price.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asking the consumer's consent before reselling data is pointless because no one reads terms and conditions, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Open APIsBoth sides of this debate support the use of open APIs for sharing data between banks and third parties. But they seem to have different interpretations of the word &quot;open.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Data aggregators and fintechs would like &quot;open&quot; to mean, open to everyone. Banks want it to mean, open to anyone they approve.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wells Fargo has created an API gateway portal and severalJSON- andREST-based APIs that are designed for specific purposes, such as account aggregation (these are used by Intuit and Xero), foreign exchange and cash management. The gateway is for vetted business customers; the bank says it encourages these fintech partners to use its data to create innovative products. It particularly welcomes API partnerships with companies that have a lot of the same customers as Wells Fargo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obviously we're not just going to answer an email solicitation from Honduras from somebody we don't know who wants to access our APIs,&quot; Watson said. In the future there may be some APIs that will be open to anyone, such as one for location data for the bank's ATMs and branches, she said. &quot;We don't need to do a Know Your Customer check for someone to embed that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kimerling suggests APIs should be open to anyone who meets a minimum standard that's published and subject to an open adjudication process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think it's in the public interest to let literally every Tom, Dick and Harry have access to that data,&quot; Kimerling said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Call for open dialogueAnother CFDR complaint is that banks won't talk to the aggregators and fintechs about their issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Why haven't we as an industry like Europe or Asia had an open and transparent debate on options and assessed them?&quot; Arora said. &quot;What is secretive about the elements of what's being proposed? If we had an open discussion of what are the options and what are the pros and cons, then you'd be able to conclude as you see fit from your perspective, but that's not what we're seeing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kimerling agreed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's not a rigorous public debate happening on what we should do with this data - it's closed and backroom-y,&quot; he said. &quot;It's also very easy to say you're protecting customers when you're trying to protect your own business.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Account and transaction data should belong to the consumer, in Kimerling's view.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Banks are fighting to hold onto this data in a way that makes little logical sense,&quot; he said. &quot;Consumers don't think their bank data is that valuable. Consumers want to freely give of their data and have their data shared in ways that add value to the customer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Banks have valid concerns about the liability they expose themselves to when customer data is federated, Kimerling acknowledged. &quot;But the data is going to be federated whether they want it to be or not.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arora and the CDFR point to Europe as a role model. &quot;I think GDPR would be a much better alternative to the bilateral agreements being proposed currently,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That might well require legislation, though, andhave you read the news out of Washington lately</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even if there weren't gridlock in the nation's capital, Kimerling is uncertain about the practicality of trying to impose the GDPR in the United States, because there are thousands of banks of different sizes and varying technical resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's hard to make standards like this because the norms that underpin them are rapidly evolving,&quot; Kimerling said. &quot;What seems like an illegitimate purpose now may feel legitimate five years from now. There's a certain reality that there are rapidly evolving norms around these things and we have to be very aware of those norms. We shouldn't assume or even want them to be static.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bottom line is, no one has truly thought through the best, most practical way to share data, and none of the parties involved have pure motives. It would be good to have an independent, unbiased person or group craft a solution. The job may fall to the CFPB or another regulator.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Banks' adversaries in the debate over account data sharing have honed their talking points and gone on the offensive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Data aggregation companies and some fintech companies need consumers' bank account data for their business models and products to work. The aggregators make money by collecting account data and streaming it to other companies, usually fintechs but sometimes banks as well. The data is gathered either through screen scraping (logging in to an online banking service using the customer's username and password and copying and pasting the transaction information into a database) or through direct connections with the banks. Fintech companies, such as those that provide robo-advisers and personal financial management apps, also rely on this data to provide their services, and obtain it through data aggregators or their own screen-scraping or direct connection.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A recently formed group representing 31 data aggregators and fintech companies, called Consumer Financial Data Rights, says banks still aren't forking over as much data as they should be. The group is meeting with bank regulators to plead their case and trying to get consumers to petition regulators on their behalf, urging them to send a Tweet that says, &quot;.@CFPB protect Americans' ability to grant access to their financial information. #handsoffmyfinancialdata.&quot; In November 2016, the CFPB launched an inquiry into the challenges consumers face in accessing, using and securely sharing their financial records.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When you talk to bankers, fintech companies and data aggregators individually, you could get the impression they're all on the same page. They all claim to know what consumers want and to be the best champion of customers' rights and protectors of their data. All say they're in favor of open APIs for sharing data. And all say their motive is to help consumers. Yet each party appears to be primarily looking out for its own business interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The leaders of the CFDR accused banks of pushing bilateral agreements that restrict the types of data that will be shared and the use cases under which it can be shared. They also said large banks refuse to even talk with them about these issues. They say they would like to see the industry coalesce around a set of principles such as the European Union'sGeneral Data Protection Rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Just think about all the important advances in health care that depend upon your data, your DNA, your healthcare records,&quot; said Jon Stein, CEO of Betterment. &quot;If all that was owned by a single doctor and you didn't have the right to access that data, own that data, transfer it to another doctor if you wanted to, there would be a terrific outcry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Banks say they have no intention of restricting data sharing, that they want to let customers decide with whom their bank account data should be shared, and that they want to make sure that data is secure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I absolutely agree customers should have control over banking information,&quot; said Brett Pitts, head of digital for Wells Fargo Virtual Channels, when Wells announced its data-sharing agreement with Intuit. &quot;The security aspects of that are important to customers.&quot; In addition to Wells Fargo, BBVA Compass, Citi, Chase and Silicon Valley Bank have set up APIs for the purpose of sharing customer data with third parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similar spats are playing out in other industries. A judge this week ruled that LinkedIn must allow an analytics company called hiQ to continue to screen-scrape user profiles while hiQ sues LinkedIn for the permanent right to scrape its data. LinkedIn argues that hiQ's automated scraping tools harvest the personal information of users and organizations for free without their permission and illegally bypasses LinkedIn's anti-scraping protections. LinkedIn has formal data-sharing deals with several other analytics companies.There are several specific points of contention between the CFDR and the banks:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bilateral agreementsThe CFDR's top complaint about banks is that they are making one-off data-sharing agreements with data aggregators and fintechs. Chase and Wells Fargo both have announced recent agreements with Intuit and with Finicity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What's happening are bilateral agreements that have been developed by a few financial institutions that have very concerning elements: data restrictions around what consumers can see around their own data and use case restrictions,&quot; said Anil Arora, CEO of Envestnet Yodlee (the data aggregator Yodlee was sold to the wealth management software company Envestnet in 2015). &quot;And the technologies that are being proposed are inconsistent across banks, they're expensive, they're not scalable, they're one-off, in some cases they're less secure, and may even lead to unintended consequences.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For instance, Arora said banks are limiting the data a company like Betterment could use to provide analysis, advice and planning to its customers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The bank in its wisdom will decide what data fields can be passed on by the consumer and which ones cannot,&quot; he said. &quot;The data restrictions are pretty significant. Another restriction that's in there is what use cases are consumers permitted to share the applications for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Imagine that: We're basically saying to the consumer, You cannot make decisions about your own life in terms of how you're using the data, you have to have a third party bank decide what you can and cannot do with your data.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Further, each bank has a different set of restrictions, Arora said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Imagine the logistical and practical impact of fintech, technology and aggregation companies having to have a different set of data and restrictions with each bank on a one-off basis,&quot; Arora said. &quot;That breaks the entire model of how you then have these solutions and services run on top of these models, because they cannot work with inconsistent data.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wells Fargo and Chase executives declined requests for interviews for this story. In the past, they have said they can't comment on their agreements with data aggregators, referring to them as legal matters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As has always been the case, nothing is intended to constrain, but to provide data in a safe, transparent way that gives customers control,&quot; Pitts said in the earlier interview about Wells Fargo's agreement with Intuit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reselling customer data to third partiesAnother issue: What happens to data once it's shared with a data aggregator or fintech company?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yodleereportedlysells some of the bank and card transaction data it gathers to investors, research firms, and hedge funds such as Steven A. Cohen's Point72 for millions of dollars. The hedge funds mine the information for clues about trends that can move stock prices. This is antithetical to GDPR principles: The consumer is not being told what's happening with his data, nor being offered an opportunity to provide consent or opt out. There's no auditable trail of consent and permission around the use of the data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yodlee says it doesn't sell personally identifiable information; the data is all anonymized. Yetanonymized data can be de-anonymizedand &quot;bank details&quot; are specifically mentioned in the GDPR as data that needs to be protected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The large banks, especially Chase, say it's their policy not to resell customer data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Chase announced its data-sharing agreement with Intuit in January, the two companies stated they would not resell data to third parties. They said customers will give explicit consent to share their data with Intuit and for Intuit applications to use specific account information, and will be able to turn on and off access for Intuit applications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The most important part of this is giving control to the customer,&quot; Jamie Dimon, chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase, said in a statement at the time. &quot;Customers will get to decide what they want to share and when they want to share it - without having to hand over their password.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Secil Tabli Watson, executive vice president and head of digital solutions for business at Wells Fargo, pointed out in an interview early this summer that there are security issues with reselling customer data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Any data can be compromised, so you want to keep your data as secure as possible,&quot; she said. &quot;Just because it's anonymized, that doesn't mean there isn't value in there that you would lose if somebody was able to eavesdrop on it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dan Kimerling, head of API banking, open platform and research and development at Silicon Valley Bank, pointed out that it's hard to draw a line between legitimate reuses of data and dodgy ones. For instance, some card organizations resell transaction data for research purposes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If there's data, and there are data moats, somebody's going to want it and you're going to sell it,&quot; he said. &quot;There's always going to be a right price.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asking the consumer's consent before reselling data is pointless because no one reads terms and conditions, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Open APIsBoth sides of this debate support the use of open APIs for sharing data between banks and third parties. But they seem to have different interpretations of the word &quot;open.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Data aggregators and fintechs would like &quot;open&quot; to mean, open to everyone. Banks want it to mean, open to anyone they approve.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wells Fargo has created an API gateway portal and severalJSON- andREST-based APIs that are designed for specific purposes, such as account aggregation (these are used by Intuit and Xero), foreign exchange and cash management. The gateway is for vetted business customers; the bank says it encourages these fintech partners to use its data to create innovative products. It particularly welcomes API partnerships with companies that have a lot of the same customers as Wells Fargo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obviously we're not just going to answer an email solicitation from Honduras from somebody we don't know who wants to access our APIs,&quot; Watson said. In the future there may be some APIs that will be open to anyone, such as one for location data for the bank's ATMs and branches, she said. &quot;We don't need to do a Know Your Customer check for someone to embed that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kimerling suggests APIs should be open to anyone who meets a minimum standard that's published and subject to an open adjudication process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think it's in the public interest to let literally every Tom, Dick and Harry have access to that data,&quot; Kimerling said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Call for open dialogueAnother CFDR complaint is that banks won't talk to the aggregators and fintechs about their issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Why haven't we as an industry like Europe or Asia had an open and transparent debate on options and assessed them?&quot; Arora said. &quot;What is secretive about the elements of what's being proposed? If we had an open discussion of what are the options and what are the pros and cons, then you'd be able to conclude as you see fit from your perspective, but that's not what we're seeing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kimerling agreed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's not a rigorous public debate happening on what we should do with this data - it's closed and backroom-y,&quot; he said. &quot;It's also very easy to say you're protecting customers when you're trying to protect your own business.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Account and transaction data should belong to the consumer, in Kimerling's view.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Banks are fighting to hold onto this data in a way that makes little logical sense,&quot; he said. &quot;Consumers don't think their bank data is that valuable. Consumers want to freely give of their data and have their data shared in ways that add value to the customer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Banks have valid concerns about the liability they expose themselves to when customer data is federated, Kimerling acknowledged. &quot;But the data is going to be federated whether they want it to be or not.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arora and the CDFR point to Europe as a role model. &quot;I think GDPR would be a much better alternative to the bilateral agreements being proposed currently,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That might well require legislation, though, andhave you read the news out of Washington lately</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even if there weren't gridlock in the nation's capital, Kimerling is uncertain about the practicality of trying to impose the GDPR in the United States, because there are thousands of banks of different sizes and varying technical resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's hard to make standards like this because the norms that underpin them are rapidly evolving,&quot; Kimerling said. &quot;What seems like an illegitimate purpose now may feel legitimate five years from now. There's a certain reality that there are rapidly evolving norms around these things and we have to be very aware of those norms. We shouldn't assume or even want them to be static.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bottom line is, no one has truly thought through the best, most practical way to share data, and none of the parties involved have pure motives. It would be good to have an independent, unbiased person or group craft a solution. The job may fall to the CFPB or another regulator.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many organizations around the world mistakenly think they are in compliance with the upcoming General Data Protection Regulations, according to a report by Veritas Technologies, a provider of multi-cloud data management tools.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company commissioned independent technology market research firm Vanson Bourne to survey 900 business decision makers in February and March 2017 in the U.S., the U.K., France, Germany, Australia, Singapore, Japan and the Republic of Korea. Nearly one-third (31 percent) of respondents said their organization already conforms to the legislation's key requirements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, when those same respondents were asked about specific GDPR provisions, most provided answers that indicate they are unlikely to be in compliance. On closer inspection, the report said, only 2 percent actually appear to be in compliance, revealing a distinct misunderstanding over regulation readiness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The findings show that almost half (48 percent) of organizations that stated they are compliant do not have full visibility over personal data-loss incidents. In addition, 61 percent of the same group admitted that it is difficult for their organization to identify and report a personal data breach within 72 hours of awareness-a mandatory GDPR requirement where there is a risk to data subjects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The GDPR dictates that multi-national corporations take data management seriously,&quot; said Mike Palmer, executive vice president and chief product officer at Veritas. &quot;However, the latest findings show confusion over what's needed to comply with the regulation's mandatory provisions. With the implementation date looming ever closer, these misconceptions need to be eradicated fast.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many organizations are starting to feel stressed and perhaps a bit confused by the General Data Protection Regulation that is quickly approaching us and will hit May 25, 2018.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, the more I talk to companies, the more I hear the same question: &quot;What exactly is it that I am supposed to do?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The answer is, 'plenty.' But first, it's essential that we understand what we're dealing with.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you've worked with regulations such as Sarbanes-Oxley (SoX) or Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) before then you have likely heard about GDPR. And like with those other regulations, the ramifications of not being in compliance when it goes into effect are severe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GDPR views each and every person that an organization interacts with (either inside or outside the company) as a center cog and every interaction as a digital footprint that requires handling &quot;the GDPR-way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Note to U.S. organizations: even if your company is based outside the EU, you may still need to be GDPR compliant. What determines the need for compliance is who you hold data on. If you collect data on any EU citizen, you are subject to the regulatios. This includes selling or shipping an item to someone in the EU, or even shipping inside the U.S. but the person doing so is using a credit card from the EU.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GDPR touches upon how we use and store data, for how long and for what purpose. It addresses how we inform individuals about which data we hold, how to anonymize the data and how we delete it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also requires control over scenarios such as who responds to the request from the consumer exercising their right to be 'forgotten' and to make sure that it's dealt with within reasonable time. The fact that some organizations are now required to hire a data protection officer (DPO) suddenly means that GDPR takes on an entirely different level of importance. With that, GDPR guidelines requires that many organizations do a comprehensive business process overhaul.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With that in mind, some organizatinns might consider shutting down a system or platform as &quot;the solution,&quot; because they feel as though they cannot oversee GDPR and don't want to risk being imposed with a fine. But how many days are you willing to run your business without your HR system or your BI and analytics platform? You built and implemented them for a reason.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Starting Line - The Audit</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Suffice to say, you'd rather not shut down systems and would prefer to become GDPR compliant. The next question is what do you do? To begin, a healthy audit is required, so you start by asking yourself these questions:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. What data does our company hold?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Awe, that's an easy one you think. You list the different systems that come to mind: ERP, CRM, HR. But then you wonder, &quot;What is the name of the system we use for data analytics?&quot; You then realize that it's not just the system's name that needs to be documented, but the entire data model inside the system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Where does our company store this data?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maybe you're lucky enough to be able to write a complete list of your company's IT systems. With that list in hand, you ask your IT department where the systems are that store their data. They could very well get back to you with the names of other systems that aren't even mentioned on your list. Your search would prove that there are more systems to document and account for than you thought.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. What is our data used for? &quot;It's used for business operations,&quot; your finance person might answer, but will neglect mentioning it's also used for budgeting, forecasting, BI and analytics. Finance might even add a few more systems to your list, since they will include the data warehouses and analytical tools they use.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you press them to define what they mean by &quot;business operations,&quot; they'll likely say something like, &quot;You know, reporting, analysis, and some self-service BI.&quot; Then, they'll look at you and ask whether you really need a complete list of where every little piece of data is used? With GDPR coming at you, you know the answer to that question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Who has access to our data? As the list of systems and data usage has grown from your inquiry, your certainty about who has data access has faded. The answer doesn't just cover access to the main company systems, but also data that's being pulled into separate systems for data analysis and visualizations, and even data that's just being fetched into Excel and later emailed &quot;to whom it may concern.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So who has access to data? Probably a lot more people than you think. Asking &quot;Why?&quot; could very well turn your list into a novel and may even include some department's dream of eventually using this data for a certain purpose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Viewing GDPR as a Golden Opportunity</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clearly, the more people you ask within your business, the longer the list will be of systems and the different kinds of data usage. Everyone from the C-Suite to the DBA is looking for resources, man-hours, tools and platforms to help them with compliance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maybe, the answer isn't about adding as many resources as possible to cover the most mileage. Instead, perhaps you should be looking for different approaches that will enable you to reach GDPR compliance. For instance, consider transforming this work item as an opportunity to strengthen your management control of all your data management platforms and to work smarter from this knowledge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The race is on to become GDPR compliant and there's lots of ground to cover. With May 25, 2018 headed our way, all organizations need to pick up speed. GDPR compliance requires many tasks but to get to the finish line it all it starts with the comprehensive audit, and the realization that it is not just about data, but about business processes and the continued wish to stay data-driven as a business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Note: The audit is only the start of the GDPR process. In part two of this series on becoming GDPR compliant, I'll take a look at some of the business processes needed so that all stakeholders can exercise their right to access and view data.)</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most data managers have now heard enough about the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation that they've moved beyond denial, anger, bargaining, and depression to grudging acceptance that it will indeed require major changes in their operations. But this leaves many wondering exactly how to move ahead in adapting to the new regime. Here's a checklist of initial steps to take as the May 2018 compliance deadline moves rapidly closer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Put someone in charge</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than anything else, GDPR is about process. Many organizations impacted by GDPR need to appoint a data protection officer who will be responsible for defining procedures to ensure compliance. This person needs to be an expert resource who builds awareness and trains people within the company about compliance procedures and is the point of contact for external authorities when there's a question, complaint, or, heaven forbid, breach to report. GDPR has strict rules to ensure the data protection officer has the resources, independence, and senior management access needed to do their job effectively. Like nearly everything else about GDPR, this is really forcing companies to do things they should do anyway, but in practice often have not given high enough priority to accomplish effectively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Check your procedures</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GDPR requires documented procedures for many things, including defining the legal basis for using data you acquire; delivering privacy notices and acquiring explicit consent when required; managing access to data by users within and outside the company for specified purposes; handling requests by customers and other data owners to review, correct, delete, or share their data; assessing security and the impact of any data breaches; training employees in data handling; and building privacy considerations into system designs. With some notable exceptions, GDPR generally avoids specifying process details and instead puts the burden on companies to demonstrate that their processes are suitable to their particular situation. The first step in meeting this standard, of course, is having documented processes for regulators to assess.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meet technical requirements</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GPDR does have some explicit requirements, such as responding to customer complaints within 30 days, sharing or erasing customer data on request, keeping records of who sees which data and reporting breaches within 72 hours. Other capabilities such as data classification, encryption, and centralized customer data management may not be explicitly specified but are almost inevitably needed to comply. Most organizations will need to do a detailed technical assessment of their systems and determine what changes they need to make.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Define a governance structure</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Compliance with GDPR will clearly be a moving target as regulatory rulings clarify what's expected, best practices evolve, and technologies change. Your firm will need a governance structure to ensure your processes keep up with the changes. One key element of this governance process will be Privacy Impact Assessments, which assess the risk of any proposed data use, balance that risk against the business value, and determine when to ask permission from a supervisory authority. The data protection officer will play a key role in governance but GDPR also touches the legal, compliance, human resources, training, IT, insurance, security, procurement, marketing, customer relations, and communications departments. All must be engaged in the governance process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, this checklist just scratches the surface of the actual steps your company will need to take to comply with GDPR. Moving to a deeper level requires detailed assessment of your specific situation. The important thing is to get started on that assessment, working with experts you train or hire. After that first step, every company will follow its own unique path.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The deadline for compliance with the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is May 25, 2018. Many organizations have spent countless hours already in their preparation for the deadline, while other organizations are just getting around to reading up on it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GDPR, like Y2K of a couple decades ago, has international implications that for some organizations HAS to be addressed as GDPR will impact the lifeblood of their operations, whereas for most organizations, some due diligence needs to be done to ensure they are within the compliance of the regulation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GDPR is today's Y2K</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I reference Y2K because I was one of the advisors to the United States White House on Y2K and spent the latter part of the decade before the millennium switchover traveling around the globe helping organizations prepare for 1/1/2000. Today with GDPR, as I did then with Y2K, believe there are fundamental things every organization needs to do to be prepared for the deadline, but to NOT get caught up in the hype and over speculation to the Nth degree detail that'll drive you crazy.&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is GDPR?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To help those catch up on what GDPR is, the regulation technically went into effect in 2016 and the deadline for compliance is May 25, 2018.&nbsp; The thing that scares people is that fines for non-compliance are up to 20-million Euros or 4% of the company's prior year worldwide revenue, which is an alarming number that gets everyone's attention.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While there are many tenants to GDPR, I net it down to three major things:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
</DIV>
<BR><UL CLASS="c9"><LI CLASS="c10"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"><NOBR>&bull;</NOBR></SPAN></P>
<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prevention of &quot;Tracking&quot; Individuals:&nbsp;This is the big thing in GDPR that goes after the big Internet companies (Google, Facebook, Amazon) that gather personal information on individuals, track the Websites they visit through cookies, and actively advertise to individuals through that tracked information. GDPR directly addresses the practice and process of gathering information on what individuals buy, sites they visit, and content they've searched for by not only requiring consent but also have clear stated purpose WHAT that information will be used for.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prevention of Retaining Personally Identifiable Information (PII):&nbsp;This tenant is not so new and has been a big piece of legislation around the world to protect individual's privacy. GDPR, like other global regulations on PII, sets limits on what personal information can be gathered (name, date of birth, address, etc), how that personal information needs to be stored and protected, and what needs to be done in the case of breach.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"></DIV>
<BR><UL CLASS="c9"><LI CLASS="c10"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"><NOBR>&bull;</NOBR></SPAN></P>
<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cross-Border Transfer of Information:&nbsp;GDPR stipulates that EU residents (citizens and even individuals that are temporarily working and living in the EU) information should remain in the EU -or- if the information leaves the EU that the target destination for the storage of the information meets specific European Commission approvals&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of the three major tenants I note for GDPR, the second and third are things that we've been addressing for some time now with the predecessor to GDPR (the DPD 95/46/ec) and the various Privacy/PII laws that are already in effect. So the big thing in GDPR is around the collection, storage, and tracking mechanisms commonly used by Internet organizations for web-based shoppers and social media participants. THOSE are the organizations that have been working very hard the past couple years already devising ways to inform, get consent, and handle tracking in a manner that fits within the requirements of GDPR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tenants of GDPR</SPAN></P>

Use of identifiable information (like Cookies) requires explicit consent.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR></DIV>

<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cross-Border Transfers:&nbsp;Also as previously noted, GDPR has tight rules on EU data remaining in the EU -or- that the target destination of EU data complies by the same standards expected of information stored in the EU&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Data Portability:&nbsp;GDPR has a data portability tenant that allows users to request their information to be allowed to be &quot;moved&quot; to another provider. Just like phone number portability in the United States that allows an individual to keep their phone number as they switch from one phone carrier to another, GDPR data portability gives users the right to request their emails, photos, documents, and the like to be transferrable.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pseudonymizing of Personal Data:&nbsp;Fancy word, but effectively the randomizing of data so that it cannot be attributed back to any particular individual, effectively making the data anonymous. However, GDPR does stipulate that just because the data is randomized doesn't allow an organization to just collect and use the information as they please. GDPR has stipulations that require an organization to justify why they are collecting the information, what they plan to do with the data, and with clear definitions how the data will be eliminated when those stated purposes are no longer valid or applicable&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Data Breach Notifications:&nbsp;GDPR tightens the timeframe that cybersecurity breach notification is made, with requirements for notification in as little as 72-hours from an organization being made aware of the breach. There are some variations to this notification where individuals need to be notified if information that can be attributed back to them (personally) has been breached, however if information has been pseudonymizied, that only the European Commission needs to be informed.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><BR><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GDPR for enterprises (not web/social media providers)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With much of the heft of GDPR focused on Web/Social Media Providers (Facebook, Google, Amazon, etc), the common question for Enterprises (corporations, small businesses, companies headquartered in/out of the EU) is what does a typical business need to think about relative to GDPR?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First of all GDPR is not a bigger thing nor a smaller thing based on the size of the enterprise. The requirements of GDPR are the same no matter the size, where the organization is headquartered, or the type of industry the organization is in. GDPR also applies to every organization that does business with companies in the EU, has employees that are citizens of the EU, or even has employees that are foreign citizens but are residing and working in the EU. So the umbrella on who has to comply with GDPR is pretty broad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A common question is whether an email system hosted in the United States can fit within GDPR requirements. For organizations that have migrated to services hosted by Microsoft (like Office 365) or Google (G-Suite), both Microsoft and Google have officially stated their cloud services WILL be GDPR compliant before the May 18, 2018, deadline. The way these services will be compliant is because the European Commissions has already approved and adopted the EU-US Privacy Shield.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While GDPR does not specifically refer to the EU-US Privacy Shield, it does explicitly acknowledge the current requirements for Binding Corporate Rules (BCR) for processors and controllers. BCR confirmation is acquired by having auditors validate and certify compliance for organizations in their movement of data globally. The EU-US Privacy Shield fits within this certified Binding Corporate Rules deemed acceptable for GDPR as it allows the European Commission to conduct periodic reviews to assure that an adequate level of data protection exists in the transferring of data cross-border.&nbsp; What remains for these cloud providers is a formal &quot;sign-off&quot; that they do indeed meet the provisions of GDPR which are anticipated to be approved without resistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Note:&nbsp;For the topic of cross-border transfers, one might hear that the most common cross-border certification, &quot;Safe Harbor,&quot; has been invalidated for GDPR, that is true.&nbsp; On October 6, 2015, the European Court of Justice invalidated the US-EU Safe Harbor Framework. However, Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs) do remain valid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Additionally, organizations can rely on Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) that are approved by the European Commission.&nbsp; SCCs are agreements between the EU exporter (ie: EU subsidiary) and the data importer (ie: US parent company or service provider) on the handling of cross-border transfers.&nbsp; Large enterprises are seeking certification under SCC approvals so that they can move corporate data between corporate offices and datacenters around the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The SCC validations are not easy to acquire as they require an audit of the data management, security, handling, and processing of information throughout an enterprise.&nbsp; However once an enterprise has an SCC, they can more freely move information throughout their organization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Handling GDPR for internal documents and content</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A common question by enterprises is whether email messages and business documents fall under the requirements of GDPR. The answer is generally no, a business document is a business document for the purpose of conducting the business of the organization. Of course if the document includes the names of employees, their home addresses, their mobile phone numbers, and other personally identifiable information, then the document falls under GDPR as well as other existing laws and regulations on information privacy.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However a business contract, marketing materials, client documents, architectural drawings, and the like exchanged during the normal course of business are not &quot;personal documents&quot; embedded with &quot;personal data&quot; for non-legitimate business uses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The KEY to handling internal documents and content to ensure the documents do not contain content subject to GDPR or other PII restricted regulations is to use content classification. Technologies built in to Microsoft's Office 365 have the ability to scan content (emails, documents, memos) and auto-classify the content as having content that appears to include PII (birth dates, social security numbers, etc).&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By auto-classifying the content, policy rules can be applied to the content that allows the creator of the content to choose who can access the information. By giving control to the originator of the content, that satisfies the requirements of GDPR by giving the content owner the free and direct control of the content, and to whom the content can be shared with.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Can employers force employees to give consent of their PII?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The short answer is NO, GDPR is very clear that consent is not valid unless it is &quot;freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous.&quot; That means an employee cannot be reprimanded nor discriminated against for choosing to not consent to blanket policies.&nbsp; This is why content classification becomes so important, it enables an organization to require users to provide consent, classify, or reclassify content as they deem appropriate on a case by case basis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Collecting and handling employee and customer information under GDPR</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GDPR is clear that an organization needs to provide users, visitors, and employees detailed information on what data is collected and how it will be used. Obviously this first makes the assumption that personal information about an individual is being collected in the first place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While some simple common business applications like the Web Browser that an employee uses likely by default has cookies enabled and is storing and tracking the Web access of the user of the Web Browser, a simple enterprise fix it to set all Web Browsers to Private or &quot;Incognito&quot; mode. This will prevent cookie tracking and storage of data protected by GDPR. A user can be allowed to turn off the Private mode if they choose, that will be their decision and their personal consent to having content potentially tracked.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the normal (historical) course of doing business, organizations do collect personal information on employees necessary for the transaction of a normal employer/employee relationship. Things like home addresses (to mail legal notices, end of year tax statements), and bank information (to process payroll and employee benefits) are commonly collected by employers. This information is necessary for an employee to get paid and receive benefits, and as long as the organization only uses the personal information of an employee for the stated purposes of payroll and direct benefits, then the organization is well within the bounds of complying with GDPR. At that point, then the organization needs to adequately store and transfer that information in a secured manner to prevent the breech of PII, which organizations can do so with content classification and document encryption technologies readily available in the marketplace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Where there is a grey line on GDPR compliance of employee data is when employee information is used to process say for example an employee's travel arrangements (booking flights, rental cars, etc). While the processing of these arrangements are in the normal course of business, not all businesses nor all employees within a business travel and have these services provided for them. As such, it is prudent that an organization clearly notify its employees and get clear consent from the employee that the organization will use personal employee information to make travel arrangements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two key provisions to accommodate variances of this type is to allow an employee to reject the organization's involvement in making travel arrangements (ie: giving the employee the GDPR given right to object) AND for the organization to allow the employee an alternative for travel arrangements (that might include allowing the employee to book their own travel with a clear reimbursement policy). Many organizations already provide these options, but for some organizations that have a very strict travel office process, there may be changes needed to fully comply with consent provisions of GDPR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The result from this type of scenario where an employee objects to a process that is deeply grounded in an organization's transactions that might not be flexible is for the organization to potentially put themselves in default of a provision of GDPR.&nbsp; As with the compliance of all laws, organizations have provisions for Risk Management.&nbsp; If it is cheaper/better for an organization to fight a violation or failure in accommodation than it is to change a deep rooted process, then the organization may just stay their course.&nbsp; Since this fits a grey area in GDPR where GDPR does not explicitly state that an organization cannot use personal employee data to make travel arrangements, it would be up to the European Commission to bring suit against the enterprise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The key for the organization is to ensure that their actions remain consistent for the legitimate interest and efficiency of the business, and that the organization isn't using the personal information to sell to some organizational that'll then profit by marketing or advertising to the employees.&nbsp; Before financial damages will be assessed on an organization, someone will have to identify that the organization worked in malice and with disregard for employee privacy by making centralized travel arrangements for employees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Summary&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GDPR is targeting the blatant breech of privacy for financial gains by organizations using technologies like cookies, data extraction, user tracking, and the like for the purpose of marketing or selling services for financial gain of user data.&nbsp;&nbsp;GDPR seeks to protect and prevent the breech of personally identifiable information by preventing organizations from collecting the information in the first place, and then making sure to protect the information (and actively delete the information) when the stated purpose has expired to minimize future exposure to data loss.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Through the awareness of what GDPR is, what falls under the general protection of GDPR, and the use of modern technologies like auto-content classification, labeling, and content management, organizations can create stronger security controls, minimize and prevent the breech of information, and ensure the proper management of protected data through the use of technological solutions available.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The must-anticipated General Data Protection Regulation will finally take effect next spring, and according to most recent studies, only a minority of organizations are prepared for the new rules.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One part of the GDPR that organizations should take not of now is Article 25, which requires the use of appropriate technical and organizational measures that protect the security and privacy of personal data on European citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This process, known as &quot;data protection by design&quot; requires that at all stages of the development, implementation, and operation of a product, the responsible entity ensures that the collection, use, storage, transmission or deletion of personal data is conducted in accordance with the GDPR, including, for example, data minimization, limited retention or appropriate data security.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Article 25 also requires that controllers ensure that, by default, only the personal data that is necessary for a specific purpose are processed. These two elements are the foundation of the design of a GDPR compliant product.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Data Protection by Design</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Data Protection by Design starts with evaluating the purposes and functionality of the proposed product, the categories of data that might be collected, and the intended uses, sharing, retention, or disposal of the data. Only a clear and detailed flowchart identifying the different components of the design, the categories of data collected, the categories of recipient of the data, and the intended use of the data, will allow understanding the potential effect of that design on the privacy rights of the end-users and other affected parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The flowchart should be analyzed to determine whether, and the extent to which, the proposed activities meet the GDPR data protection principles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, is all data that is proposed to be collected acquired &quot;fairly and legally&quot;? Are there any legal justifications that allow the collection of the data? Or should there be a technical process in place to allow the end-user to consent to the use of the data? How should that consent be obtained to ensure adequate user experience? Is the amount of data collected appropriate for the proper operation of the product? Or should the amount or nature of the data collected be reduced or modified to ensure that only the information that is strictly necessary is collected?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the earliest stage of conception and development, sound security measures should be identified and encoded in the software or other technology used in the product or as part of the service. Adequate security must be present in the entire life cycle. For example, access to data should be guarded with appropriate authentication measures, and modification of existing data should be allowed only to specified individuals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Disposal of data, when the product or service is dismissed or terminated, should be planned and programmed accordingly, and incorporated within the coding, so that all data stored in the associated databases, memory, or other storage devices is properly and securely deleted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The duration of data retention should be limited both as part of the original design and subsequent updates to that design, to ensure that data is kept for the minimum amount of time necessary, thereby avoiding the retention of unnecessary data and reducing the risk of theft or loss. Attention to the detail, variety, and flexibility of security measures from the early stages of development is especially important in view of the substantial risk of a breach of security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Data Protection by Default</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The design should also incorporate the proper analysis and processes for ensuring &quot;data protection by default,&quot; as required by GDPR Article 25(2). &quot;Data protection by default&quot; requires that the initial settings be set, so that, by default, the highest levels of privacy, security, and data protection are provided to the end user. This would include, for example, limiting the amount of information that is automatically collected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The design should ensure that personal data is not inadvertently made accessible to an unlimited number of persons by default. Instead, the initial product settings should prohibit disclosure, sharing or access and should require the prior intervention of the concerned individual before the data can be disseminated or disclosed to others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Integration with Existing Structures</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The review of the different aspects of the flowchart should take into account the existing privacy policy of the company to ensure that the proposed collection, storage, processing or sharing is in line with the company's existing privacy and data protection values. If there are discrepancies, the product or these documents and policies would have to be updated accordingly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Methodology</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To ensure that all important aspects are covered, the review could be organized using the same methodology as that which is used to conduct data protection impact assessments. This will help determine the extent to which the proposed processing is likely to pose risks to the privacy of individuals or the security of their personal information. In the end, the analysis described above should result in the creation of a list of requirements, restrictions or conditions to be followed in the design and development of the product and throughout the entire period during which the product is put in use.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conclusion</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Data protection by design and by default principles provide important guidance for the development and operation of a product or service. They translate into practical application the general principles that are found in most data protection laws, and in the fair information practices principles, as well. They help guide the creation of a solid base that helps balance the legitimate interest or right of individuals in protecting the privacy and security of their personal information and the business and other objectives of companies collecting and processing the data.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are 10 months to go before the General Data Protection Regulation goes into effect in Europe, and several recent studies find that a majority of organizations are not ready for the data protection rules.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With that in mind, eCommerce systems integrator Tryzens has outlined 10 steps organizations must take in order to mitigate risk in their business and implement GDPR effectively to ensure compliance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GDPR is legislation designed to replace the Data Protection Act of 1998 in the UK. It aims to harmonize the approach to protection and privacy of personal data collected and/or about citizens in the EU. While maintaining the values of the free flow of information among its member states, the GDPR also gives individuals more transparency and control over what companies do with their data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In order to comply with GDPR, Tryzens says organizations should observe the following:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Check you have notified the Information Commissioner's office that you are a data controller (an organization that owns the data). This can be done atwww.ico.org.uk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Share information with management and your board on GDPR impact and obligations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Use a data self-assessment survey to identify risk and readiness for GDPR. A good one can be found athttps://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/improve-your-practices/data-protection-self-assessment/getting-ready-for-the-gdpr.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Update or implement both a formal data protection policy and privacy policy that covers the responsibility to secure data, with legitimate consent and for the sole purpose of lawful processing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Appoint someone responsible for leading, managing, and monitoring GDPR compliance across the business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Prepare for the new law to be enforced by updating internal and relevant supplier processes, auditing personal data held by your business (for customers, prospects, and employees) in order to ensure only relevant data is securely maintained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Update your employee handbooks and train all your staff on GDPR and their obligations and responsibilities to comply with it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Check and/or update your data collection consent wording across your relevant channels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Check customer and supplier contracts, notably in regard to digital service suppliers that are part of your supply chain to provide service to your customers, as they may be data processors but the retailer remains the data controller and must be able to enforce their policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. Check your insurance coverage for compliance with GDPR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;GDPR will significantly impact how retailers collect and process personal information, be they pureplay etailers or traditional bricks and mortar,&quot; said Andy Burton, CEO of Tryzens. &quot;We have less than 12 months before the deadline and with hypersensitivity in the market to avoid adding any friction to a customer shopping experience (because of the potential impact to sales conversion), I cannot stress enough the importance of ensuring the ecommerce, store, marketing and trading teams fully understand what compliance to GDPR looks like so they can adapt to deliver a positive and seamless customer experience.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New data protection regulations are coming to the European Union and any business with access to the data of EU citizens should waste no time preparing for the changes ahead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On May 25, 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) will become law. Regarded as one of the biggest legislative developments within the data protection and privacy space, GDPR will impact many businesses - potentially including those located outside of the EU - that hold personal data on EU residents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the past, EU businesses haven't been required to disclose security breaches. Once the GDPR goes into effect, that will change. New accountability obligations coupled with tighter restrictions on data aim to make the privacy and protection of personal information a priority for every business.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, there's plenty of work to be done as May 2018 approaches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a survey from AvePoint, only26 percent of multinational organizationskeep records of data processing and transfers. That's problematic, especially considering the maximum fines defined by GDPR can be as high as the greater of 20 million euros or four percent of a company's global annual turnover.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With less than a year until GDPR becomes the law of the land, here's what businesses can do to put themselves on the path toward compliance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Analyze the data</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Organizations with access to data from EU citizens can start off by taking stock of where personal data is being stored as well as what it's being used for. Keeping a close eye on sensitive information might make it easier for businesses to work toward compliance mandates later on. In some cases, these organizations may examine the data and realize they no longer need it, reducing the risk of fines and other penalties tied to noncompliance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Put security policies to the test</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The right tools can go a long way toward ensuring personal data doesn't fall into the wrong hands. For example, the Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) may provide a detailed look at how data is shared throughout a company and maintained for years to come. These types of assessments help shed light on potential risks as well as ways in which security systems and policies can be improved moving forward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Go on the defense</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Equipped with their risk evaluation, the next step is for businesses to implement technical measures to ramp up both security and privacy. From encrypting devices and securely wiping old software to archiving needed emails containing personal data, there's no shortage of ways to protect sensitive data. Regardless of which avenue they choose, it's crucial that businesses take the time to review the effectiveness of each method.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A survey conducted by FireMon found thatmore than half of all IT professionalshave experienced a firewall configuration change that opened a potential security breach and ultimately caused business downtime. By carefully evaluating each technical measure put in place, organizations can ensure customer information stays secure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Know customer rights</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the GDPR, EU citizens will have more control over their personal information than ever before. As a result, businesses must be prepared to get their data access and deletion policies up to speed. Moving forward - except under certain conditions such as public interest in the area of health - customers may enjoy the right to erase any and all personal data being held by a company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similarly, the right to access and correct personal records will also be made available to EU residents. Organizations that make a concerted effort to review and update their data policies will be better positioned to provide the data management customers will come to expect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given the new requirements of the GDPR, businesses ought to take another look at the way data is collected, processed and managed. From analyzing consumer data to implementing technical measures, organizations that follow the four steps outlined above will be on the path to achieving compliance and protecting the private information of EU citizens long after the GDPR goes into effect.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The demand for data analysts shows no signs of slowing, as nearly half of organizations say they plan to add these professionals to the payroll this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is the conclusion of Experian, in its recent white paper on &quot;Investing in digital transformation: This year's most sought-after data roles.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As noted by author Thomas Schutz, senior vice president and general manager at Experian Data Quality, &quot;data-driven businesses need two things: data and people who understand data. As organizations work to keep up with the pace of digital transformation, many of them are looking to their information as an opportunity to drive revenue and reduce costs. You need to have the right people on your team who can collect, manage and analyze your data in order to create business value.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Accordingly, 46 percent of organizations polled by Experian are increasing their headcounts for data analysts this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But data analysts come in a variety of stripes, with different skills, and knowing which one is right for your organization depends on business needs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When hiring a data analyst, it's important to first define how granular you'd like to get when analyzing your data,&quot; Schutz advises. &quot;If you're interested in identifying high-level trends such as user engagement or activity, a potential candidate would need less technical expertise - and be a cheaper resource to recruit - than a candidate who would be expected to analyze vast amounts of data to build predictive models.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schutz describes the ideal candidate as one who has &quot;a comprehensive understanding of data science concepts and is comfortable using statistical tools such as SPSS and big data tools like Apache Spark and Hadoop. Because this role is typically business-facing, they should also be a skilled communicator who can break down complex data science concepts into terms business users can understand.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Data analysts aren't the only data pros in demand this year. According to Experian's research:</SPAN></P>

</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Helping to drive interest in the data protection officer role is the upcoming General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe, which goes into effect on May 25, 2018.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In preparation for GDPR, &quot;we are seeing an increase in the number of U.S. organizations looking to hire data protection officers,&quot; Schutz says. &quot;The data protection officer will become a required position for all organizations that collect or handle the personal data of EU citizens.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When hiring a data compliance officer, &quot;compliance with GDPR requires a deep understanding of data protection processes and laws, especially those impacting EU citizens, so any potential DPO you interview should be well versed in those areas,&quot; Schutz notes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In addition, they should demonstrate an aptitude for navigating technical and organizational structures, as they will need to interface with employees at all levels of your organization in addition to the proper regulatory bodies outside of your organization,&quot; Schutz says. &quot;The ideal DPO should have exceptional management skills and be a skilled communicator able to traverse potentially difficult conversations with regulators.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps the biggest surprise in the Experian report is the demand for chief data officers. When recruiting and human resource execs were asked about hiring plans for this role, 19 percent said they have plans to add chief data officers to staff. But, when chief executive officers were asked about plans to hire a CDO, that number rose to 51 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Because a CDO would typically be hired by their C-level peers, we believe that the actual number of companies hiring a CDO role is closer to that 50 percent mark - and that makes it, by far, the most sought after position by businesses today,&quot; Schutz concludes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">485  words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IBM has introduced the 14th generation of its Z series mainframes, which still sell respectably despite repeated predictions of their demise. One of the major features being touted is the simple ability to encrypt all of the data on the mainframe in one shot.&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mainframe, called IBM Z or z14, introduces a new encryption engine that for the first time will allow users to encrypt all of their data with one click-in databases, applications or cloud services-with virtually no impact on performance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new&nbsp;encryption engine&nbsp;is capable of&nbsp;running more than 12 billion encrypted transactions every day. The mainframe comes with four times more silicon for processing cryptographic algorithms over the previous generation mainframe along with encryption-oriented upgrades to the operating system, middleware and databases.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The encryption technology also allows for much faster encryption of APIs and encryption keys than existing technologies-again so performance is not impacted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The result is a seven times increase in encryption performance over the z13 mainframe and 18 times faster than x86 servers, which make up the bulk of the server market today, IBM claims.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Big performance from this big iron</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The big iron comes with some big performance beyond encryption. The z14 also can run the world's largest MongoDB instance with 2.5 times faster Node.js performance than x86-based systems, and it can host up to two million Docker Containers or 1,000 concurrent NoSQL databases. Its memory footprint is 32TB, which is three times the size of the previous generation.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Software upgrades released with the z14 are available to customers of the z13 mainframe, but they won't be able to take full advantage of the new encryption features because they won't have the crypto processors.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IBM notes that encryption is often largely absent in corporate and cloud data centers because current solutions for x86-based servers can degrade performance and can be too complex and expensive to manage. As a result, the company notes only about 2 percent of corporate data is encrypted today, while more than 80 percent of mobile device data is encrypted.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IBM believes its new mainframe will be particularly popular with businesses in the European Union, where new regulations regarding encryption and data protection are set to go into effect next year. The EU's new General Data Protection Regulation will, among other things, hit a company subject to a data breach with significant fines unless they are able to demonstrate that the data were encrypted and the keys protected. GDPR regulations go into effect next year.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Along with the mainframe announcement, IBM also announced the launch of IBM Cloud BlockChain data centers in six cities worldwide, all using z14 mainframes. These data centers will offer secure cloud services using the z14 cryptography technology.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company expects to ship the new mainframe this quarter.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response to the ever-increasing number of high-profile data breaches, lawmakers and regulators around the world are enhancing existing data security compliance requirements, implementing new legal frameworks and defining new data security regulations to respond to increasing internal and external threats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In December of 2015, the European Union agreed to a draft of one such legal framework known as the General Data Protection Regulation, or the GDPR. These new requirements will go into effect May 2018, but this year is an important one to prepare for compliance as this regulation affects every business offering goods or services to EU citizens regardless of where the company resides.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GDPR was designed to harmonize data privacy laws across Europe, to protect and empower all EU citizens' data privacy and to reshape the way organizations approach data privacy. But what does it actually mean for organizations that maintain data? And why should they take it seriously?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's what U.S. organizations need to know about the impending GDPR requirements:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Larger penalties for data breaches</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even without any supposition or accusation of deliberate misuse of personal data (which is still a major part of the regulation), the introduction of the GDPR will place an even greater onus on organizations to safeguard the personal data they hold from accidental disclosure and cyberattacks. If they fail to take the proper steps and protect that data, the limits on penalties for breach are much larger than most have dealt with before - with reported fines of up to \xE2,\xAC20m or 4% of annual worldwide turnover for groups of companies, whichever is greater.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Outsourced risk no longer means passing the buck</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new rules also make clear another important factor: that you can outsource your risk, but you can't outsource your responsibility. If organizations use a third-party provider to store or handle data - such as a cloud provider - they are still responsible for the correct handling and protection of personal data and must be able to demonstrate how the data is protected at all times, whether in their own or in the remote system. Therefore, formal privacy-by-design techniques need to make their way down the supply chain if companies are to avoid penalties or nightmarish discovery and analysis tasks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Creation of the data protection officer</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the most drastic changes brought about by the GDPR is the creation of an entirely new role within any organization that interacts with EU citizen information - the &quot;data protection officer.&quot; In a nutshell, the DPO will be in charge of making sure that EU citizens' data is compliant with GDPR regulation. And if things should go wrong? The DPO's neck will be on the line, facing large fines and even potential jail time if the data is not properly protected and compliant. The major hurdle in the creation of this new role is that thousands of DPO positions will need to be filled in the coming year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Trust through capabilities, not contract In the days of the GDPR's predecessor, Safe Harbor, compliance was primarily based on a &quot;trust through contract&quot; model, allowing any certified entity to process personal data that had been transferred from Europe. With the GDPR, organizations must now possess clearly demonstrable data protection capabilities for the data of EU citizens. In the coming year, it's going to be interesting to see how many organizations will be forced to shift their business models dramatically in order to maintain compliance with GDPR regulation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Providing online access to personal data</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Organizations will now have to provide citizens with online access to any of their own personal data they store. With the GDPR in effect, organizations must make this available for download &quot;~where possible' and &quot;~without undue delay.' This is a very significant change; making these online data protection requests secure - in the context of these new stricter rules for protecting it at all times - will represent a significant challenge to many organizations and will require adoption of robust cybersecurity technology across the board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As we get closer toward the GDPR's enactment, we're going to see a lot more activity and questions from U.S.-based companies (and their legal counsel) around the day-to-day impact of this new legislation. I anticipate that companies will be reviewing their data security best practices throughout 2017 to ensure that they are in compliance with these stringent EU standards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My advice for businesses is to start planning and mapping out their security strategies right away. In doing so, organizations can allow themselves the time to adopt the appropriate technologies and, ultimately, to prevent themselves from falling behind the data privacy curve.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As companies continue to infuse technology into their business models, they must also keep up with an ever-changing digital landscape. In 2017 and beyond, companies need to consider their cybersecurity practices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As cyber attacks continue to rise in frequency and sophistication, companies should also consider where data breaches are occurring. For those looking to understand data breaches by country, the latest report from IBM Security and Ponemon Institute sheds light on such a topic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sponsored by IBM Security and conducted by Ponemon Institute, the study found that the average cost of a data breach is $3.62 million globally, a 10% decline since 2016.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To explore the complete report, visit the IBM Security Data Breach Calculator, an interactive tool that allows you to manipulate report data and visualize the cost of a data breach across locations and industries, and understand how different factors affect breach costs.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">The costs by region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the 2017 global study, the overall cost of a data breach decreased to $3.62 million, which is down 10% from $4 million last year. While global costs decreased, many regions experienced an increase.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the U.S., the cost of a data breach was $7.35 million, a 5% increase compared to last year. When compared to other regions, U.S. organizations experienced the most expensive data breaches in the 2017 report. In the Middle East, organizations saw the second highest average cost of a data breach at $4.94 million </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> an uptick of 10% compared with the previous year. Canada ranked third with data breaches costing organizations $4.31 million on average.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">European nations experienced the most significant decrease in costs. Germany, France, Italy and the U.K. experienced significant decreases compared to the four-year average costs. Australia, Canada and Brazil also experienced decreased costs compared to the four-year average cost of a data breach.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Time is money when you're containing a data breach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the third year in a row, the study found that having an Incident Response (IR) Team in place significantly reduced the cost of a data breach. IR teams, along with a formal incident response plan, can assist organizations to navigate the complicated aspects of containing a data breach to mitigate further losses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the study, the cost of a data breach was nearly $1 million lower on average for organizations that were able to contain a data breach in less than 30 days compared to those that took longer than 30 days. The speed of response will be increasingly critical as General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is implemented in May 2018, which will require organizations doing business in Europe to report data breaches within 72 hours or risk facing fines of up to 4% of their global annual turnover.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's still room for improvement for organizations when it comes to the time to identify and respond to a breach. On average, organizations took more than six months to identify a breach, and more than 66 additional days to contain a breach once discovered.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Additional key findings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- For the seventh year in a row, healthcare topped the list as the most expensive industry for data breaches. Healthcare data breaches cost organizations $380 per record, more than 2.5 times the global average overall cost at $141 per record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Close to half of all data breaches (47%) were caused by malicious or criminal attacks, resulting in an average of $156 per record to resolve.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Data breaches resulting from third party involvement were the top contributing factor that led to an increase in the cost of a data breach, increasing the cost $17 per record. The takeaway: Organizations need to evaluate the security posture of their third-party providers </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> including payroll, cloud providers and CRM software</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to ensure the security of employee and customer data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Incident response, encryption and education were the factors shown to have the most impact on reducing the cost of a data breach. Having an incident response team in place resulted in $19 reduction in cost per lost or stolen record, followed by extensive use of encryption ($16 reduction per record) and employee training ($12.5 reduction per record).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many companies are unprepared for General Data Protection Regulation, a set of rules designed to protect the personal data of European Union residents that is due to go into effect in May 2018, according to a report by online IT community Spiceworks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The organization conducted a survey of 779 IT professionals in the U.S., U.K. and other countries in the E.U. in June 2017. It showed that many companies are unsure what steps they need to take to comply with GDPR and how these new data privacy rules will impact their businesses, noted a post by Peter Tsai, senior technology analyst at Spiceworks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In general, U.S.-based IT professionals in are not as informed as their European counterparts when it comes to GDPR. While 43 percent of IT professionals in the U.K. and 36 percent in the rest of the E.U. said they're informed about GDPR and how it affects their business, only 9 percent of IT pros in the U.S. said they have an understanding of what the regulation entails.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The knowledge gap in the U.S. could be due to the fact that 43 percent of U.S.-based IT professionals don't think GDPR will affect their organization, Tsai said. By comparison, only 3 percent of IT professionals in the U.K. and 9 percent in the E.U. think their company will be exempt from GDPR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Considering GDPR potentially affects any company in the world that collects data on E.U. residents, some U.S.-based companies might have to scramble next year to comply with the regulation if they incorrectly assume GDPR doesn't apply to their businesses, Tsai said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The demand for data analysts shows no signs of slowing, as nearly half of organizations say they plan to add these professionals to the payroll this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is the conclusion of Experian, in its recent white paper on &quot;Investing in digital transformation: This year's most sought-after data roles.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As noted by author Thomas Schutz, senior vice president and general manager at Experian Data Quality, &quot;data-driven businesses need two things: data and people who understand data. As organizations work to keep up with the pace of digital transformation, many of them are looking to their information as an opportunity to drive revenue and reduce costs. You need to have the right people on your team who can collect, manage and analyze your data in order to create business value.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Accordingly, 46 percent of organizations polled by Experian are increasing their headcounts for data analysts this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But data analysts come in a variety of stripes, with different skills, and knowing which one is right for your organization depends on business needs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When hiring a data analyst, it's important to first define how granular you'd like to get when analyzing your data,&quot; Schutz advises. &quot;If you're interested in identifying high-level trends such as user engagement or activity, a potential candidate would need less technical expertise - and be a cheaper resource to recruit - than a candidate who would be expected to analyze vast amounts of data to build predictive models.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schutz describes the ideal candidate as one who has &quot;a comprehensive understanding of data science concepts and is comfortable using statistical tools such as SPSS and big data tools like Apache Spark and Hadoop. Because this role is typically business-facing, they should also be a skilled communicator who can break down complex data science concepts into terms business users can understand.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Data analysts aren't the only data pros in demand this year. According to Experian's research:</SPAN></P>

<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">18 percent expect to add chief data officers&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Helping to drive interest in the data protection officer role is the upcoming General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe, which goes into effect on May 25, 2018.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In preparation for GDPR, &quot;we are seeing an increase in the number of U.S. organizations looking to hire data protection officers,&quot; Schutz says. &quot;The data protection officer will become a required position for all organizations that collect or handle the personal data of EU citizens.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When hiring a data compliance officer, &quot;compliance with GDPR requires a deep understanding of data protection processes and laws, especially those impacting EU citizens, so any potential DPO you interview should be well versed in those areas,&quot; Schutz notes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In addition, they should demonstrate an aptitude for navigating technical and organizational structures, as they will need to interface with employees at all levels of your organization in addition to the proper regulatory bodies outside of your organization,&quot; Schutz says. &quot;The ideal DPO should have exceptional management skills and be a skilled communicator able to traverse potentially difficult conversations with regulators.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps the biggest surprise in the Experian report is the demand for chief data officers. When recruiting and human resource execs were asked about hiring plans for this role, 19 percent said they have plans to add chief data officers to staff. But, when chief executive officers were asked about plans to hire a CDO, that number rose to 51 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Because a CDO would typically be hired by their C-level peers, we believe that the actual number of companies hiring a CDO role is closer to that 50 percent mark - and that makes it, by far, the most sought after position by businesses today,&quot; Schutz concludes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ninety percent of companies in an Experian survey admit they had at least one global data breach in the past five years, yet 32% have no incident response plan in place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Data Protection Risks &amp; Regulations in the Global Economy,&quot; sponsored by Experian Data Breach Resolution, surveyed 558 individuals involved with their companies' global privacy and data security regulations to reveal their overall level of understanding and capability to mitigate emerging international risks. Financial services (19% of respondents) was the largest segment surveyed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The survey discovered companies' overall security measures and policies are inadequate to manage global breaches. In fact:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">39% believed they provide the right policies and procedures to protect information assets and critical infrastructure in all overseas locations.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The survey also sought to reveal how prepared U.S. companies are to face an ever-changing global regulatory landscape such as the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation, scheduled to go into effect in May 2018.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this study, 74% of respondents are either very familiar or familiar with the GDPR; and 89% of respondents said it will impact their companies' approach to data protection in locations outside the U.S. More worrisome: only 9% report their companies are ready to comply; and 59% do not understand what they need to do to comply.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thousands of American companies that do business with European customers need to reckon with EU's General Data Protection Regulation. The GDPR changes the handling of personal and corporate data particularly in terms of personally identifiable information. Even credit unions in the U.S. are likely going to have to comply with this law if they have any members who moved to, or live in, Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Companies overwhelmingly recognize the potential challenges and downfalls of new global regulations, but not their overall purpose or benefits:</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><UL CLASS="c9"><LI CLASS="c10"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"><NOBR>&bull;</NOBR></SPAN></P>
<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only 41% of respondents believe global regulations will strengthen their organization's privacy and data protection practices.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
</LI><LI CLASS="c10"><P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2"><NOBR>&bull;</NOBR></SPAN></P>
<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet, 69% agree that failure to comply would have a detrimental impact on their organization's ability to conduct business globally.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the Experian report, the actual notification process of communicating to individuals impacted by global breaches will likely hit companies hard, specifically those failing to prepare. As part of the GDPR's requirements, organizations must report a data breach within 72 hours of becoming aware of it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Instead of facing this concern head on, companies may go to great lengths to avoid compliance and requirements, with 50% claiming they would consider closing overseas operations because of overly strict compliance,&quot; the Experian report revealed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Companies not only agree that the notification of data breach victims on a global scale is very difficult to perform as is, but also don't believe it necessarily benefits victims of a data breach (according to 59% of respondents regarding GDPR's 72-hour requirement). It is likely companies will struggle even more following the full adoption of GDPR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Overall the study found that companies fear, yet fail to properly understand and address global risks and regulations. Data breaches are the biggest security risk for companies operating globally and, while companies are aware of and have experienced the backlash of these incidents, the majority are not taking steps to adequately prepare for and manage existing and emerging threats,&quot; the Experian survey noted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Editor's note:The MDM &amp; Data Governance Summitwill be held July 12-14 in San Francisco. In anticipation of that event, Information Management asked summit host Aaron Zornes, president of the MDM Institute, for his assessment of where the master data management market is at the midway point in 2017, and what we can expect for the year ahead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If I were to characterize the state of the master data management market in a single sentence, in nutshell it would be, &quot;MDM is dead, long live MDM!&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Master data management remains a $2 billion-plus software market that drags along another $3 billion to $5 billion in service revenues each year and is growing at 10 percent or so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are under currents and swells in the MDM space as there are in every tech market ... and some sea changes. But the fundamentals remain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While there is still a lot of excitement about new technologies such as cloud and graph database replacing so called &quot;legacy&quot; technologies, in reality the boring but strategic business processes of onboarding customers and suppliers, and transacting with your customers and suppliers remain fundamental business requirements that cannot be ignored. And these business fundamentals are greatly enhanced by the quality data that MDM brings to the equation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It seems as if the very large scale ($100 million and up) MDM programs or not as widespread as they were three to five years ago, which is causing some stress on the software vendors and the systems integrators. Many of the MDM programs we see are increasingly tactical rather than enterprise in nature. That is, organizations are more likely to fund MDM programs to solve a specific business problem than a wide range of business problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the other hand, organizations must still comply with regulatory reporting aspects such as Europe's GDPR, and &quot;know your customer/know your supplier&quot; also continue to drive global business requirements around MDM.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reference data also still remains a very important tactical investment for many organizations as they realize they must get this aspect under control to help them both transact and report within their company, and outside the company with their strategic supply chain and government partners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Big data and Hadoop are still topics of interest given the pending flood of information coming from the Internet of things. But in practice, big data it was a very challenging and expensive distraction for certain large vendors such as IBM... who lost their way somewhat in regards to MDM, business intelligence and more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is also an undue emphasis on &quot;cloud anything&quot; &quot; software-as- a-service, hosted apps, etc. This is due mostly to the simple minded focus of Wall Street and other financial markets where they believe that no tech company will survive unless it has huge investments, and solid proof, that they have ongoing major transition to cloud-based whatever.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the uptake by the market for cloud MDM has been rather ho-hum. We can count less than 50 actual semi-native or native cloud MDM installations and many of those are batch analytical MDM supporting data warehouses and data marts ... or they are merely proof of concept exercises (POCs) where the enterprise IT group is testing graph database and other concepts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are speaking here about Dell Boomi, Informatica C360 for SFDC and Reltio. IBM has even backed off their prior public stance for cloud MDM they had in place the past two years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The exception to this is Oracle with their Cloud CDM (customer data management). Oracle makes it a requirement that any cloud app that is purchased (Marketing Cloud, Sales Cloud, Service Cloud) also take on Cloud CDM.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a marginally functional MDM platform, not at all up to the feature/functionality of its on-premise predecessors Siebel Universal Customer Master (UCM) and Oracle Customer Data Hub (CDH) for eBusiness Suite applications. However, Oracle's executive management has a fixation on cloud revenues on paper to satisfy Wall Street expectations. As a result, every Oracle sales rep must sell this Cloud MDM capability when they sell the Oracle Cloud applications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another exception to the cloud MDM malaise concerns consultancies. Many of them are ramping up marketing programs to promote &quot;MDM as a Managed Service&quot;. Some top mega systems integrators are shedding thousands of employees as they attempt to become recurring revenue stream businesses, acting more like software vendors and supporting cloud computing services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, graph technology is enabling cross-domain analytics for the mega vendors and is a key differentiator in the marketplace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bottom line is that the fundamental business value drivers of the MDM marketplace remain in place, and MDM continues to evolve and embrace cloud and graph technologies, albeit not as fast as certain vendors' marketing would lead you to believe.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These services have grown in popularity as methods of sharing and downloading data, emphasizing the need for organizations to put policies in place to ensure data is safe and secure, the study said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the first time, Netskope investigated collaboration services as a separate category for cloud DLP policy violations. During the quarter, Web mail remained the leader in DLP violations with 43 percent of violations. Cloud storage came in second with 31 percent and other cloud service categories combined to make up 16 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the deadline to comply with the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) less than a year away, organizations need to ensure they are adopting security protocols that both understand the data flow of all information in the cloud as well as secure that data, the report said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, there has been little change in GDPR-readiness, Netskope said, with 67 percent of cloud services not specifying that the customer owns the data, 90 percent not supporting encryption of data at rest, and 41 percent of cloud services replicating data in geographically dispersed data centers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">885  words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first debate is finished. It's over. Everyone in the banking and payments sectors can agree that regulatory technology, or regtech, is the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The unending flow of new regulations has proved the compliance industry can no longer operate effectively without regtech to take the strain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The payments industry has been especially affected by increased regulation, with payment providers now having to conduct higher levels of due diligence to address concerns about money-laundering, fraud, money-transfer scams, and data privacy.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But regtech alone still doesn't seem to be enough. But even with regtech, compliance departments are still struggling to cope. This has recently provoked regulators to start discussing the possibility of extending the deadlines for the implementation of MiFID II, FRTB, and GDPR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Compliance officers across financial services will breathe a sigh of relief if the deadlines do get extended. Many I've spoken to are having a very tough time. And they've all got the same problems: legacy systems that must be updated for GDPR; the interpretation of difficult terms in new AML rules; and formulating methods to implement tricky regulations in a way that minimizes impact on our companies' bottom line.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Extending these deadlines, though, is only tackling the symptoms, not the root cause. Compliance departments in the biggest banks and payments companies are overworked. There are too many changes coming at them from all directions, all at once. There's too many for them to cope with, even with the assistance of regtech. And there is literally no end in sight. New regulations stretch away into infinity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The solution, I believe, is to recognise that regtech is more than simply a way to automate processes; a way to automate repeatable tasks at scale on millions, or even billions, of data points, such as monetary transfers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the future, I see regtech as an industry-wide platform which connects the compliance sector together; collating, analysing, and unleashing the intelligence and compliance know-how.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I believe regtech is capable of smashing through all our silos, dismantling the Chinese walls between different compliance departments on Wall Street, the City of London, and the emerging financial tech hubs. It will help us to share collective intelligence to mutualise costs and reduce risks of compliance. Ultimately, it could transform and lift up compliance, and enable it to play the absolute central role in our industry's future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What does this mean in practice? It means creating a shared platform that all compliance departments globally can connect to, both to share best practice and know-how, but also to access the latest emerging regtech in the form of modules that can be downloaded and installed, just like social networks allow its users to install apps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At its most simple, this would mean compliance officers sharing best practice about implementation; at its most advanced, it might be compliance departments open sourcing new compliance algorithms to benefit the entire industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, if a payments company developed a new algorithm to effectively monitor and accurately detect suspicious cross-border transfer activity, this could be openly shared on the platform.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While this might sound crazy initially, this is not too different from the information sharing that currently takes place in the payments industry. For example, in many countries payment providers, and other financial institutions, openly share information about known fraudsters to stop billions in fraud taking place every year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once this platform is rolled out, tricky regulatory questions won't have to be answered by different companies separately, which saps time and resources, rather, there will be a collective central hub that combines the experience and knowledge of all compliance officers, everywhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why would companies want do this? Why would they want to share best practice and hard-won knowledge? Surely, this is all highly confidential, and sharing it with their competitors would put them at a serious competitive disadvantage?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First, it's a myth that compliance can truly be a competitive advantage. At the end of the day, as regulated institutions, we all have to comply with the same regulations. Being the first to find a loophole or solve a tricky question is unlikely to be anything more than a cause for quiet celebration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Surely it would be much better if we all stopped fighting an unwinnable battle, saved money, and reinvested it in the value-added services that are our real competitive advantage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Secondly, as compliance officers, our ultimate aim should be to make the global economy as safe as possible. But altruism aside, risk has a habit of turning on us later down the line, and protecting consumers from unregulated products often protects our own interests too. The best way to take control of risk will always be to work together.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, software presents us with an immediate solution to the constant deadline extensions in the form of more automation. But, even in the medium term, it will not be enough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are missing regtech's most significant potential: connecting compliance departments to share the latest technology and best practice. This will mutualise the cost and time we have to separately invest in compliance. But only if we let it.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Space is significantly more data-center-friendly than earth, reckons a Los Angeles company that recently received a U.S. patent for a proposed galactic server farm and associated network.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cloud Constellation Corp. says it's going to provide a way for organizations and governments to shift chunks of data around, without using the traditional terrestrial infrastructure that it says is slow, insecure and a legal minefield.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This concept will soon become reality,&quot; president Cliff Beek says, writing in Nextgov about SpaceBelt. &quot;Data will never pass through the internet or along its leaky and notoriously insecure lines.&nbsp;In-transit espionage, theft and surveillance become impossible.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">+ Also on Network World:&nbsp;Lasers will allow real-time satellite communications +</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Companies being able to host data without having to wrangle with onerous international compliance laws is one of the selling points Beek pitched in a recent press release.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, new heavy-weight European data privacy regulations, known as General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), were recently approved by the trading bloc for 2018.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GDPR will be tougher than already-rigorous consumer laws relating to data there. One of the principal aims of new GDPR is that EU residents' private data should be protected even if it's processed outside of the EU. Therefore, traditional foreign-based clouds will not be exempt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beek claims, however, that SpaceBelt-stored data would be exempt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Remove the relevant data altogether from the GDPR's jurisdiction-which means taking it off-world,&quot; he writes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Improved data security and throughput</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Data security will be another advantage when it comes to space-held data, the company says. It says &quot;leaky internet and leased lines&quot; are subject to &quot;hijacking, theft, monitoring and sabotage&quot; and that its dedicated telecom backbone network won't be. In fact its &quot;network-ring&quot; won't be connected to the internet it says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Better throughput, too, is obtained by &quot;avoiding traditional terrestrial 'hops,'&quot; it claims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SpaceBelt's still-to-be-launched data center platform will operate in low-earth orbit (LEO). That's the area between the Earth's surface and 1,200 miles up, and it is the same zone that SpaceX and the OneWeb Internet infrastructures will use for their upcoming broadband constellation roll-outs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cloud Constellation Corp. expects to build eight satellites for testing at the end of 2018, according to an interview chief executive Scott Sobhani gave with SpaceNews Magazine last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the system, laser optical data pipes communicate between bed-sized server-containing satellites that are storing the data, and then data is then streamed &quot;to secure customer terminals on earth,&quot; the publication explained then.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lasers may increasingly become used in space for no-latency, real-time data transmission. A major advantage over incumbent land or terrestrial radio is that there are fewer obstructions in open space, which means data can be sent over longer distances without the need for latency-introducing repeating.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2015,&nbsp;I wrote about almost-no-latency space laser communications. Airbus's proposed combination LEO and Geo-stationary orbit (GEO) pipe had, in testing then, obtained speeds of 600 Mbps over a 45,000 kilometer link.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That system, known as SpaceDataHighway, went live at the end of 2016 and has a data rate of 1.8 Gbps now. Capacity is 40 terabytes a day.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unlike the slow deployment and growing awareness surrounding the EU's General Data Protection Regulation, China's cybersecurity law has created some surprise. The law, which officially came into effect June 1, was crafted and passed at such relatively quick pace that many in the legal tech industry were unfamiliar with its existence in early 2017.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But apprehension over the law's effects has grown as well, as many have begun understand its scope and provisions. Much concern has been expressed, for example, over the severe criminal penalties facing companies that fail to comply.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dan Whitaker, managing director of Consilio's China operations, told Legaltech News that &quot;public surveillance, imprisonment, and the death penalty are all listed as possibilities for violating the state secrets provision of the Cybersecurity Law.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though there are many specifics of the law that still need to be determined by government agencies, there are a few areas corporate counsel should be familiar with in order to best protect and prepare their organizations:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">1. The Law May Affect a Broad Range of Organizations</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When first drafted, the majority of China's cybersecurity law only affected what it deemed &quot;critical information infrastructure operators&quot; (CIIOs), which the law defines as including telecommunications and broadcasting companies, public service and critical infrastructure industries, military and government agencies, and large network and internet providers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the full extent of what else can constitute CIIOs is not yet entirely clear, given that they can refer to any company that handles or collect personally identifiable information and what the law vaguely terms as &quot;important business information.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;In terms of 'important information,' the thought is trade secrets, intellectual property or national security information, but the law does not make it clear,&quot; said Everett Monroe, a data privacy and IP Attorney at Hanson Bridgett. He added that many are &quot;waiting for additional interpretation by administrative agencies&quot; on this point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In April 2017, China also released &quot;Draft Measures&quot; to clarify the cybersecurity law, which expanded companies covered by the law to include &quot;network operators&quot; as well as CIIOs. Tiana Zhang, an attorney at Kirkland &amp; Ellis's Shanghai offices, told Legaltech News that this term is &quot;broadly defined as any network owners, administrators, and network service providers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Monroe cautioned that the interpretation of what constitutes a network operator &quot;is dependent on the administrative agencies, but the law can be read very broadly. [Network operators] really can be any anybody who is running a local network for their business.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">2. Each Covered Group Has its Specific Cybersecurity Responsibilities</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Figuring out whether one is classified as a CIIO or network operator is pivotal given that each group has have different levels of cybersecurity obligations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Network operators for example, &quot;have to have a data security plan in place and really adopt what we in the U.S. and Europe would call technical organizational and administrative measures to protect the network,&quot; Monroe said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added while this is not an unusual requirement for cybersecurity regulations, &quot;what is different [with China's law] is the amount of verbose detail the cybersecurity law goes into. [Network operators] are to adopt measures such as data classification and backup and consider the use of encryption, and things like that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, CIIOs have to meet the same cybersecurity standards as well as additional obligations, such as creating an &quot;incident response plan and coordinating with government agencies and other organizations to address issues of business continuity, systematic failure, leak containment and communication&quot; after a cyberattack or breach, Monroe explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is also the requirement for CIIOs that &quot;any sort of device that are on the network, things like routers or switchers, have to be approved by some sort of security certification program or through a government agency,&quot; he added. &quot;The law does not make clear exactly which agencies or groups they are, but we assume that they would be state-certified groups.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">3. Certain Data Must be Kept In-Country, With Caveats</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the cybersecurity law, Chinese citizens' PII and &quot;important business information&quot; created and collected in the country must be stored on local servers. Such a requirement may force local and multinational companies to revamp their IT infrastructure and depend on local storage providers for assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;China is a fan of the cloud-as long as it's a Chinese cloud,&quot; Whitaker told Legaltech News. &quot;This means increased dependence on providers with a presence in China and experience in working in the market here. For enterprises, this means increased review of the types of data flowing in and out of the country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The data localization requirement, however, is not absolute. Companies can transfer data out of the country when necessary for business purposes, but must first conduct a security self-assessment to review if the transfer is in fact needed, if proper protections exist around the transfer, and the risk of data being breached, destroyed or leaked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When data transfers meet certain criteria, such as those that exceed 1000 GBs, have the PPI of over 500,000 citizens, or contain information relating to national security or the security of a CIIO, a yet-to-be-defined government agency has to conduct its own security assessment before the transfer can proceed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">4. PII is Regulated Similar to Other Global Data Privacy Laws</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">China's cybersecurity also law follows in the footsteps of the EU's GDPR by mandating that companies must obtain the consent of Chinese citizens before collecting, handling or processing their PII.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are several restrictions on how the PII is used, how it is collected and making sure it is not misused,&quot; Monroe said. &quot;According to the law, if a user finds the data has been misused, the user can go back to that company and demand the deletion off their data. And if it's inaccurate, they can demand the correction of that data as well.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two major events are slowly playing out in Europe. Each will have a major effect on the future of law and business there, and companies on both sides of the Atlantic are scrambling to adjust. MCC spoke with Davina Garrod and Jasper Helder, partners at Akin Gump Strauss Hauer &amp; Feld LLP in London, to find out what they are advising clients about the United Kingdom's impending exit from the European Union and about the rollout of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The interview has been edited for style and length.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MCC: Davina, what is the current state of negotiations between the EU and the U.K. for Brexit?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garrod: Well, formal negotiations between the EU and the U.K. have yet to start. On the 29th of April of this year, the General Secretariat of the Council in Brussels published guidelines on the negotiations, and these define the framework for negotiations under Article 50 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). As you know, Article 50 is the TFEU provision, pursuant to which the U.K. has given notice that it's going to be exiting the EU. In reality, negotiations won't formally start in earnest much before the German general election is held on the 24th of September. This is because Germany is the largest European economy and one of the founding members of the EU.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those are negotiations in terms of the withdrawal agreement for the U.K., which the EU has stated needs to include money, a plan for how to sensibly address the border issues between Northern Ireland (part of the U.K.) and the Republic of Ireland (a separate and remaining EU member state) and protections for EU citizens who will be living in the U.K. There will be a separate set of negotiations on trade. The U.K. has yet to formally decide on what kind of trade agreement they're pushing for. My hunch is that it's probably going to be a comprehensive fair trade agreement with the EU. The EU is being very, very strict on sequencing, and they're saying that they're not even going to enter into a discussion about trade until the withdrawal agreement - or &quot;divorce settlement&quot; - has been decided. And of particular importance is the divorce lump-sum payment that the EU is pushing, which, depending on which newspapers you read, could be anything from 40 billion euros to 100 billion euros.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MCC: Wow. That's serious money. Jasper, how can companies prepare their operations and business dealings for the U.K.'s departure from the EU?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Helder: At present the framework of the arrangement between Europe and the U.K. in respect to many things - like the movement of people, the movement of services, the movement of goods, the movement of capital - is not laid out yet. There is a lot of political posturing on the European side, on the English side, ahead of the actual negotiations. We need to see what the details are going to look like. But that said, there are a couple things that you can do. And I'm an international trade and customs lawyer, so my focus is on the movement of goods. There is a whole financial services chapter to Brexit, London being the major capital market for all of Europe. But that is a very different and very specialized area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When it comes to goods, if I were a company with business operations on both sides of the channel, I would start looking at what my supply chain actually looks like. Where am I sourcing my products from globally? Where do I bring those materials to, where are my production locations? And which markets do those production locations serve? Because if I am, say, a U.S.-based company, and I have a production and sales operation that is located in the U.K. that also services the European continental market, that is a point of risk for me. Because the continued access of those products from the U.K. into the continental European market is really contingent and dependent on the agreement that the U.K. and the EU are going to strike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, there is a lot of speculation around this, but the fallback position, if there is no such agreement, is the World Trade Organization framework. And the U.K. has made concessions about import tariffs that it would maintain in a WTO context. But nobody really wants to go there, because these tariffs are relatively high in comparison to what the European Union now has in its single customs tariff. And another factor that I would want to take into account is what red-tape documentation&shy; - formal processes - there are if I'm going to cross the channel with goods destined for the European market. So these are things that I would look at. And if you want to be completely independent from the agreement that is struck, and not find yourself between the European Union and the U.K., you would want to maintain a footprint on both sides of the channel. Whether that is viable from a cost and business perspective, that's another question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MCC: How will Brexit impact trade within the region? Are there other risk areas, as you identify them, for companies to be thinking about at this early stage?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Helder: I think there are. If you picture the scenario where you have a production plant in the U.K. that is sourcing its materials from all over the world: At this moment the U.K. as part of the European Union is a party to free trade agreements with many third countries outside the EU. For example, Mexico and other areas throughout the world. Now if the U.K. were to leave the European Union and had no free trade agreements in place with all of the places that you are sourcing your materials from, that means that the free trade as facilitated by the current European trade agreements from which the U.K. benefits no longer applies. That is also why the British government is seeking to pursue negotiating free trade agreements with third countries as quickly as possible. The dialogue between May and Trump is definitely going to be impacting. Another issue that is immediately relevant is that the U.K. will no longer be part of the customs union if there is an all-out hard Brexit. So that means when you cross the channel with products, you need to follow full customs formalities. That could potentially delay transit. It also means more work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MCC: How will Brexit affect U.S.-based companies with offices in the U.K. that may be staffed in part by non-Brits from the EU? And what other employment issues is Brexit likely to create for U.S.-based companies?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Helder: As you have probably read in the media, there has been quite some discussion about May not wanting to guarantee European Union workers rights in the U.K. up front. And from the U.K. perspective, that is like keeping a trading card up your sleeve with a view to the negotiations that are going to start soon. However, if you realize that one of the political drivers behind the Brexit vote was the immigration question, I think it's also something that is a sensitive issue. That being said, the U.K. to a large extent depends on the European Union. So again, a hard Brexit without any arrangements simply means that there are no guarantees for non-U.K. nationals - other than those they would acquire under U.K. immigration law. So for a U.S.-headquartered company with a significant operation in the U.K., employing many continental European nationals, this definitely is an issue to watch. And it is also one of the major issues that the EU and U.K. have already identified to hash out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So it's immigration, residency status as one aspect. Another is one of professional qualifications. If I take, for example, the legal profession, at this moment a lawyer who is admitted to the bar in a European country can move to London. That's what I did myself. And you register with the London regulatory authority, and you are allowed to practice in the U.K. as a registered foreign lawyer. All of that is based on European directives. Now if these fall away, then the question is (and not just for the legal profession but for other regulated professions as well, like accounting): How is the equivalence of U.K. versus European admission dealt with? So if you are a U.S. company and you have an operation in the U.K. employing many of these regulated professions, I think that is another issue you might want to look into very carefully.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MCC: Davina, let's move on to how Brexit will impact corporate M&amp;A and other transactions in the U.K.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garrod: At the moment, pre-Brexit, M&amp;A activity, which in part involves U.K. companies, has actually been quite strong. We're finding that there are a lot more deals around now, and as sterling's value has been impacted (it has reduced), you're seeing a lot more U.K. corporate targets. We've been involved in a number of deals involving U.K. corporate targets. Akzo, for example, is known as a Dutch company, but it has a substantial U.K. presence - it purchased a very large U.K. company a few years ago - and it remains a target.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Immediately after the referendum, though, if you're somebody who just works on U.K. domestic deals, then your practice would have been heavily impacted, and a number of U.K. clients put their M&amp;A on hold. Fortunately, Akin Gump is a very international and cross-border firm, and so our M&amp;A practice has boomed. Indeed, there was a Trump bounce and a lot more deals involving our U.S. clients, and European (including U.K.) targets abounded. We continue to be very busy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From an antitrust perspective, once the U.K. comes out of the EU, then all deals involving U.K. companies will need to be considered from a U.K. merger control perspective as well as from an EU merger control perspective. The EU Merger Control Regulation provides a one-stop shop for merger reviews within the EU28. But post-March 2019, the U.K. will be outside of the EU, and the U.K. merger control provisions in the U.K. Enterprise Act will apply in full force. Then, from a dispute resolution perspective, there could be changes to the enforceability of English judgments in EU member states (and vice versa) in the M&amp;A context, and there might be a greater use of arbitration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In terms of public takeovers in the M&amp;A context, there's been no sign so far that the U.K. Takeover Code will be changed. Indeed, the U.K. takeover rules give effect to the EU Directive on Takeover Bids. Furthermore, the takeover regime in the U.K. was established in its current form prior to the directive, so we're unlikely to see many changes here. It is worth noting, however, that - as with the U.S. - economic protectionism continues to sweep across Europe, and the U.K. government is re-thinking its industrial strategy and whether further scrutiny should be applied to foreign acquirers of strategic U.K. assets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MCC: Moving to a different subject that also has the attention of a lot of general counsel, what exactly is the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and who does it impact?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garrod: The GDPR is a regulation that EU member states - including the U.K. - must be fully compliant with by the 25th of May, 2018. The GDPR replaces the Data Protection Directive from way back in the 1990s. For many years we've had a bit of a patchwork quilt of privacy rules around the EU. At one end of the spectrum you have the German regime, which is very strict and rather formalistic compared to the more permissive U.K. regime, which is principles-based. The EU, over the last few years, realized that it needed a harmonizing legislation that would strengthen and unify the different countries' regimes to ensure that European and non-European companies, such as big U.S. tech companies, would only have to deal with one set of data protection laws - rather than having to spend a lot of money and time figuring out what the different privacy laws are in France, Germany, Italy and elsewhere in the EU28.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GDPR is supposed to be a good thing, and broadly speaking, I think it is a very good piece of legislation. It beefs up privacy laws so that, from May 2018, if a company breaches certain of its provisions, then it could get fined as much as 20 million euros, or up to 4 percent of its global revenue, whichever is the greater. If you think about how large some of these U.S. tech companies are in terms of revenues, we're talking about incredibly large fines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MCC: Well, you've always had much stricter privacy regulations than we have over here on the other side of the pond. So what steps do U.S.-based companies need to take to achieve compliance with the GDPR, and what challenges can they expect?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garrod: Initially you need to obtain management buy-in within the company because, particularly for U.S. companies, privacy in the EU hasn't necessarily been first on their list of things to worry about. As an internal compliance person in a U.S. company, you need to get a budget from the company in order to be able to provide a road map for compliance and execute on this plan, thereby ensuring compliance. More specifically, you need to set individual milestones for compliance and agree on the timing of essential deliverables. This would include identifying current and new types of personally identifiable information - not just things like people's names and dates of birth and email addresses, but also other types of personally identifiable information, including digital photographs. You also need to determine the legal basis for each type of data processing activity that your company will be doing, and document this. The act of &quot;processing,&quot; for example, has a very wide definition. It could be something as basic as just opening an email and seeing somebody's date of birth. Furthermore, specific consents from data subjects will need to be obtained for specific acts of processing. Authorities are due to publish guidance on how this expanded consent regime will work in practice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MCC: Were the fines that you mentioned designed to make it very clear to the general counsel that this is serious, and to give those attorneys exactly the kind of message they need to deliver to the CEO to obtain the buy-in that you mentioned?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garrod: Yes. I think this huge increase in fines is really important. I think it is already acting as a deterrent - ensuring that senior management in companies take notice and dedicate sufficient resources to ensure that there are no privacy violations. Questions have been raised, though, as to how aggressive particular data protection authorities in certain EU countries will be when it comes to enforcing the GDPR. We already know that Germany has a very strong history of aggressive enforcement of privacy laws, and so we expect the federal regulator in Germany, and the individual privacy regulators in the individual states in Germany, to continue to be strict enforcers. However, there are other countries in the EU that are not as interested in data privacy, and they may not enforce some of these rules particularly strongly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the decisions for companies is: Who will be your primary data privacy authority? Because, you know, some companies are active across the EU, but there's usually going to be a lead authority that will be your key authority that you liaise with. I know some clients who are seriously considering moving a lot of their personal data from Germany into a EU country with a more permissive enforcement regime. They are currently figuring out whether they can possibly do this from a commercial perspective.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MCC: Interesting. There's also the question of how the GDPR will affect the U.K. after Brexit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garrod: So far the GDPR is in the category of rules to which the U.K. government probably isn't going to be making too many changes. There are laws that the U.K. government, broadly speaking, is OK with. There might be elements of the GDPR that they might want to tweak, but because a lot of the existing U.K. privacy law is already in the GDPR, we don't expect too many changes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The realistic thing to bear in mind is that many U.K. companies will still be subject to the GDPR post-Brexit, because the GDPR has a very wide reach. More specifically, the GDPR will apply to companies outside of the EU that target, by way of online marketing, for example, EU citizens. Even if a company is based in the U.K., the fact that it's marketing to EU citizens means that it's going to be subject to the GDPR in any event. I think the U.K. government is cognizant of that. We're telling our U.K. clients that they still need to ensure compliance to the GDPR by May 2018, just as we're telling our U.S. clients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another important element to all this is that transferring personal data from the EU, which includes the U.K. at this point in time, to jurisdictions outside the EU, like, for example, the U.S., is already heavily regulated. This is because of the disparity between data protection rules in the EU and certain more permissive regimes, like the U.S. Indeed, there has been ground-breaking litigation in this area, and transferring data from the EU to the U.S. without the correct model contract clauses in place (or binding corporate rules) can give rise to privacy violations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Privacy Shield regime (or Safe Harbor II, as it is also known) came into effect last year. Some companies have signed up, whereas other companies don't feel that it's actually worth making that kind of investment, and so they're continuing down the binding corporate rules/model contract clauses avenue. We're advising our clients on both of these avenues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MCC: It's a pretty complicated time we're living in, isn't it?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garrod: It really is. We could have done without Brexit, for sure. But, you know, we can't be too negative about it. There are potential opportunities for the U.K., and upsides for U.K. investors and for U.K. companies. I think the next 18 months are going to be crucial for the U.K. If you listen to some of the Greeks who had to negotiate with the EU in the context of the Greek financial crisis and bailout, the one message that they have for Theresa May is, &quot;Don't bend over backward and try and concede too quickly. The EU plays a very hard and aggressive game of poker, and if you concede too quickly on any point, then you've lost.&quot; We could have a real face-off until the bitter end, where it's only on the verge of a hard Brexit that the EU and the U.K. can come to some compromise. There is no doubt that the EU has the advantage of scale in these negotiations, and continued goodwill and strong negotiating skills will be essential if the U.K. is to get the best possible deal for its economy and citizens. Fortunately, there appears to be an appetite on both sides for a transitional period of at least five years, which would prevent both sides from &quot;falling off a Brexit cliff.&quot; The EU - including the U.K. - has a long history of finding pragmatic solutions for intractable problems. At least these negotiations will be conducted against the backdrop of a peaceful and relatively prosperous Europe.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, another survey from WinMagic which attempted to establish how current data policies at global organizations align with GDPR finds that there is still a great deal of preparatory work to do by many firms in order to avoid substantial non-compliance fines.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thousands of American companies including credit unions that do business with European customers need to reckon with EU's General Data Protection Regulation, which goes into full effect a year from now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GDPR changes the handling of personal and corporate data particularly in terms of personally identifiable information. The regulation, slated for a May 25, 2018 rollout, already weighs heavily on the European business community, but come as a surprise to many U.S.-based enterprises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevertheless, the financial services industry is beginning to evaluate how to tackle the incoming data protection regulation because many expect financial-institutions to wear the biggest bull's-eyes when GDPR finally comes into play. Financial institutions have a little over a year to come up with a comprehensive approach and plan for managing and securing European consumer data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you are a credit union in the U.S. you are likely going to have to comply with this law if you have any members who moved to Europe or live in Europe.&quot; Michael S. Edwards, vice president and general counsel for the World Council of Credit Unions, said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Edwards, who worked on the issue for WOCCU, explained there is currently a data privacy shield framework that the U.S. Commerce Department allows for transferring data from Europe to U.S. based companies. &quot;That's not going to help at all with this GDPR regulation; you are going to have to comply with both,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The International Association of Information Technology Asset Managers identified the top five ways the new EU regulations affects any organization:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Data breaches.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If a company experiences a data breach, it must report it within 72 hours of the company becoming aware of the incident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Data protection officer requirement.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The EU determined that an individual is necessary to ensure maintenance of data privacy and control at each company doing business in Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Consent of those providing data.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The data controller bears the burden of proof for the data subject's consent for specified purposes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Special handling of data related to Europeans.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Any organization that handles personal information of EU citizens such as phone numbers, addresses or any other identifying information will be subject to the GDPR. In addition, any organization receiving the information third-hand will also be subject to the regulation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Potential for hefty fines and court penalties.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An organization faces fines for non-compliance and breaches by the member states to protect personally identifiable information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The European commission says you have to have a representative, in each country where a member lives,&quot; Edwards said. In addition, to having a registered agent, Edwards noted credit unions must have a data protection officer and an EU-focused privacy policy for members living in Europe. The fines for not complying with GDPR are up to 20 million Euros (almost $22 million) per violation or up to 4% of the organization's annual revenue, whichever is higher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a breach scenario involving those members' account information the credit union would have to inform the government of whatever country it is within 72 hours,&quot; Edwards explained. He added the fines per breach per person are 10 million Euros (about $11 million) or up to 2% of the financial institution's revenue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Edwards warned for U.S.-based credit unions, it might worth doing some compliance work in this area even if only one of two members live in Europe. &quot;It's a lot more than credit unions want to risk.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gary Southwell, general manager of Boston-based CSPi, suggested, &quot;Credit unions should ask themselves, 'Do we have this type of information? The next question they should ask is, 'Does it matter?'&quot; Southwell also pointed out that GDPR not only goes into effect across all 28 EU nations but the United Kingdom plans to adopt GDPR despite Brexit, at least for now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GDPR ensures there is one set of criteria to protect individuals and help companies understand compliance issues when it comes to personally identifiable information. &quot;Companies that have European subjects' information, whether they are in the EU or outside the EU, have to comply with this especially if they want to do business in the EU,&quot; Southwell maintained. &quot;If credit unions have European subjects' information it then applies to them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CSPi created a system, Advanced Forensic Framework, specifically designed to assist security resources in protecting their most critical data by quickly visualizing, detecting and capturing all suspicious activity that monitors the conversations to the critical assets. &quot;In a credit union that would be the databases that keep the company's records,&quot; Southwell said. &quot;We tried to make it easier to watch the critical data in an organization.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Southwell added, &quot;For companies in regulated industries it is even more important to solve these challenges in order to adhere to data privacy laws, such as the EU's GDPR. We took a much more pragmatic approach to the problem, placing focus on the data that must be protected at all costs, an organization's PII, financial transactions, and/or intellectual property.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joe Garber, vice president of marketing, information management and governance software at the Palo Alto, Calif.-based Hewlett Packard Enterprise, views GDPR as helping organizations identify and secure sensitive information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garber said HPE found many organizations are not looking at this as a compliance challenge but as a risk management challenge. &quot;What they need to do is get started; identify what their greatest risks are first,&quot; he said. And with 270 pages, many organizations do not know where to get started.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The potential fines alone are not driving financial institutions and other organizations to take GDPR seriously, Garber suggested. It is the additional ramifications such as lawsuits stemming from not taking the appropriate measures, negative fallout affecting reputation; the need to lock down PII and understanding how to use the information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HPE Software just launched GDPR Starter Kit, which helps organizations take a critical first step in preparing for the GDPR. This bundled set of software solutions assists organizations to automatically identify, classify and take action to secure information that falls under this regulation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've gone through GDPR and created a number of use cases that that specifically address certain articles within GDPR,&quot; Garber said. &quot;The way we look at things within HPE, it is relatively easy to comply with GDPR because it is really two steps.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garber remarked the first is to classify what is in scope with the regulations and identify what PII is. The second is to apply policies to that information. That includes data mapping, analyzing and classifying information and then optionally moving the information to a centralized repository.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GDPR Starter kit's bundled solutions also help customers conduct a personal data assessment and optionally encrypt data that is subject to these regulations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Any organization that processes or handles data from EU citizens must become familiar with GDPR and totally comprehend the effect it will have on business processes. Between its sweeping scope and the penalty structure, the EU's pending rules warrant serious attention with an eye to what it will take to ensure full compliance, even by American financial institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The effective use of technology is critical for organizations to monitor what sensitive EU citizen data they hold, and to apply and enforce policies to protect this information,&quot; Stewart Room, global data protection legal services leader at PwC, said. &quot;With the upcoming EU General Data Protection Regulation set to deliver a fundamental change in how personal data is handled, organizations must ensure they have the right technology and controls in place to meet the new requirements. The natural first step for many is to use analytics tools to understand what personal data is held, where it's being stored, and how to classify it.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The European General Data Protection Regulation will have a global impact when it goes into effect on May 25, 2018, according to Gartner Inc. And the firm predicts that by the end of 2018 more than half of companies affected by GDPR will not be in full compliance with its requirements.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The GDPR will affect not only EU-based organizations, but many data controllers and processors outside the EU as well,&quot; said Bart Willemsen, research director at Gartner. &quot;Threats of hefty fines, as well as the increasingly empowered position of individual data subjects tilt the business case for compliance and should cause decision makers to re-evaluate measures to safely process personal data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gartner recommends that organizations act now to ensure they are compliant when the regulation takes effect. They should focus on five high-priority changes to get up to speed with GDPR requirements:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Determine your role under the GDPR</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Any organization that decides on why and how personal data is processed is essentially a &quot;data controller,&quot; Gartner said. So GDPR applies not only to businesses in the European Union but to all organizations outside the EU processing personal data for the offering of goods and services to the EU, or monitoring the behavior of data subjects within the EU.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appoint a data protection officer</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many organizations are required to appoint a data protection officer, and this is especially important when the organization is a public body, is processing operations requiring regular and systematic monitoring, or has large-scale processing activities, Gartner said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Demonstrate accountability in all processing activities</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Few organizations have identified each process where personal data is involved, the firm said. Going forward, data quality and data relevance should be decided on when starting a new processing activity, it said, as this will help to maintain compliance in future personal data processing activities. Organizations need to demonstrate an accountable posture and transparency in all decisions regarding personal data processing activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Check cross-border data flows</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Data transfers to any of the 28 EU member states* are still allowed, as well as to Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland, Gartner sais. Transfers to any of the other 11 countries the European Commission (EC) deemed to have an &quot;adequate&quot; level of protection are also still possible. Outside of these areas, appropriate safeguards should be used.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prepare for data subjects exercising their rights</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Data subjects have extended rights under the GDPR, Gartner said. These include the right to be forgotten, to data portability and to be informed of data breaches. If a business isn't prepared to adequately handle data breach incidents and subjects exercising their rights, now is the time to start implementing additional controls, the firm said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite all the effort and funds spent by organizations on cybersecurity, a majority of consumers don't trust brands to protect their personal data. In fact, that is the view of 68 percent of consumers surveyed for the recent &quot;2017 State of Consumer Privacy and Trust&quot; study by Gigya.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A similar number (69 percent) worries about security and privacy risks posed by the increasing adoption of Internet of Things devices, including fitness trackers, smart watches and connected cars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The study polled more than 4,000 consumers on their views of personal data privacy and security. &quot;For brands, the findings highlight an impending crisis as they balance customer expectations and new privacy requirements with their need for customer data to deliver a more personalized online experience,&quot; the study noted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of special note is the pending General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which goes into effect in May, 2018. Once GDPR becomes law, &quot;brands will then face new hurdles in presenting and protecting their European customers' data.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thousands of American companies including credit unions that do business with European customers need to reckon with EU's General Data Protection Regulation, which goes into full effect a year from now.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GDPR changes the handling of personal and corporate data particularly in terms of personally identifiable information. The regulation, slated for a May 25, 2018 rollout, already weighs heavily on the European business community, but come as a surprise to many U.S. based enterprises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevertheless, the financial services industry is beginning to evaluate how to tackle the incoming data protection regulation because many expect financial-institutions to wear the biggest bull's-eyes when GDPR finally comes into play. Financial institutions have a little over a year to come up with a comprehensive approach and plan for managing and securing European consumer data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you are a credit union in the U.S. you are likely going to have to comply with this law if you have any members who moved to Europe or live in Europe.&quot; Michael S. Edwards, VP and general counsel of the World Council of Credit Unions, said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Edwards, who worked on the issue for WOCCU, explained there is currently a data-privacy shield framework that the U.S. Commerce Department allows for transferring data from Europe to U.S. based companies. &quot;That's not going to help at all with this GDPR regulation; you are going to have to comply with both.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The European commission says you have to have a representative, in each country where a member lives,&quot; Edwards said. In addition, to having a registered agent, Edward noted credit unions must have a data-protection officer and an EU-focused privacy policy for members living in Europe. The fines for not complying with GDPR are up to 20 million Euros (almost $22 million) per violation or up to 4% of the organization's annual revenue, whichever is the higher amount.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gary Southwell, general manager of Boston-based CSPi, suggested, &quot;Credit unions should ask themselves, 'Do we have this type of information? The next question they should ask is 'does it matter?' Southwell also pointed out that GDPR not only goes into effect across all 28 EU nations but the United Kingdom plans to adopt GDPR despite Brexit, at least for now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joe Garber, vice president of marketing, information management and governance software at Palo Alto, Calif.-based Hewlett Packard Enterprise, views GDPR as helping organizations identify and secure sensitive information. &quot;What they need to do is get started; identify what their greatest risks are first.&quot; With 270 pages to tackle many organizations do not know where to get started.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regulatory schemes for protecting data, whether healthcare or otherwise, are often criticized in the United States for being fragmentary and siloed. No coordinated regulatory framework exists because that is not the way in which United States law was implemented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, different industries have their own structures, and those are the &quot;lucky&quot; industries as many do not have any protective scheme at all. Healthcare has arguably the most famous data protection scheme in place, the Privacy and Security Rules under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the arguably robust privacy protections contained within HIPAA, the question remains whether those protections are sufficient. Professor Nicolas Terry raised this question in his recent article &quot;Existential Challenges for Healthcare Data Protection in the United States.&quot; While Terry praises the robust nature of privacy protections of HIPAA, it is really only a positive endorsement by comparison to the poor state of other privacy protections in the United States.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As explained by Professor Terry, HIPAA places almost all of its eggs in implementing &quot;downstream rules,&quot; which focus on the processing or use and disclosure of data. For those familiar with the HIPAA Privacy Rule, this explanation makes a lot of sense. The Privacy Rule governs the use and disclosure of protected health information. There is no focus on &quot;upstream&quot; or collection activities. All efforts are placed on setting parameters around how data are distributed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Further, HIPAA is limited in the scope of players to which it applies. There are three broad categories of entities that need to comply with HIPAA: covered entities, business associates and subcontractors. Covered entities are the driving force, which are really the traditional players in healthcare, namely providers (encompassing physicians, hospitals, nursing homes, home healthcare and more) and health insurers. Noticeably absent are the newer entities, like mobile health app developers or wearable manufacturers, which all operate on the periphery of traditional healthcare system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the heart of Professor Terry's concern, the overabundance of downstream protections and the hyper focus on traditional healthcare, create significant deficiencies in what is arguably the best set of privacy protections in the United States. The incoming General Data Protection Regulation (&quot;GDPR&quot;) that will soon be in full force and effect in the European Union is cited as the premier privacy scheme because it combines a variety of protective measures. Is implementation of such a scheme like the GDPR possible in the United States? That is an open question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Systems in the United States have been allowed to develop in silos and without much coordination. As a result, the systems that are in place have developed in a specialized manner, uniquely tailored to their individual industries. While it would be good to see a generally applicable framework for protection of all data that is industry-agnostic, such a hope is unlikely to come to fruition any time in the near future. Given that reality, it is necessary to work within the existing framework (HIPAA) and get creative in finding the means of expanding requirements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One &quot;creative&quot; (or confusing) means of expanding the framework of privacy protections is the layer added by state law. While state law cannot loosen protections created by federal law, it can add more proscriptive requirements. Many states have piled onto the HIPAA's downstream protections by restricting use and disclosure of different forms of sensitive information, such as mental health, HIV/AIDS or other discrete matters. Additionally, states are imposing data breach notification requirements onto entities in the healthcare industry that go beyond notice required by HIPAA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From this perspective, maybe states could help in switching the paradigm to add &quot;upstream&quot; protective requirements. A patchwork approach from the state level would impose burdens on entities at first, but could result in a couple of federal level scenarios. One would be pre-emption by federal law imposing uniform collection requirements, or such laws could be struck down in a different form of pre-emption. Either way, a clear standard could be set.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bottom line is that the world of data protection has entered a new reality. The amount of data being created increases every day with no sign of slowing down any time soon. Will the law be able to keep up?</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">By Ian Lopez</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEWS</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">716  words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In May 2018, the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), will be in place, meaning virtually any organization with data in or passing through the EU will have a host of new compliance requirements. And though warnings and reminders continue to surface, there remains concern that organizations haven't started the road toward compliance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, among those advocates are major law firms that cater to the Fortune 500 crowd, and one of the ways they're approaching compliance is through technology. On May 25, a date chosen to line up exactly a year before GDPR goes into effect, Hogan Lovells released its GDPRnow app. Available for download at the iTunes store, the app is meant to be a quick guide to aid organizations in prepping for GDPR compliance.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's a look at the app and how it may help address compliance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">How it works:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The app provides users with seven questions, and based off the answers, it generates an action plan for an organization to begin compliance efforts. The questions asked deal with issues like how data is stored and what sort of data is collected, while the actions generated by responses are organized by priority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Who it serves:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The GDPR itself will impact virtually anyone with data in the EU, regardless of organization type and size. Hogan Lovells global privacy and cybersecurity partner Eduardo Ustaran told LTN that the app &quot;is suitable for both large multinational organizations and very small players,&quot; but that the intended audience in each group is different. In the case or a larger company, the user would likely be privacy counsel, a privacy compliance officer, or a chief privacy or data protection officer, while a smaller company user would likely be the general counsel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Why an app?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While compliance may not be the first task that comes to mind when using your iPhone, Ustaran said Hogan Lovells thought the app was &quot;a simple but effective way&quot; to provide users with the questionnaire needed to generate the action report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We wanted to emphasize that despite the huge complexity of the whole European data framework and complexities of the GDPR, it's not impossible to come up with a list of actions to do,&quot; said Ustaran, who came up with the idea for the app.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">What time should people start to use the app? </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ustaran said that the firm chose May 25 to emphasize that &quot;compliance is going to take time, but with a year to go it's the right time to start getting on with it.&quot; And while he said that all organizations are different, generally speaking, a year should be enough time to come up with a plan of action, identify priorities, and then address them on a quarterly basis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">What's in it for Hogan Lovells?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rather than a perk for clients, the app is free for download and available to the general public. Further, usage of the app doesn't require any direct consultation with Hogan Lovells attorneys. However, while the app can generate a generic action plan for an organization to begin working on compliance, actually undertaking a plan requires quite a bit more effort, and whether an organization can do that on their own depends on what resources they have in house. In the event that an organization needs to craft a contract or enact a policy, they could then call Hogan Lovells or any law firm of their choosing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Law firm slash tech company?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Not quite. While the Ustaran and Hogan Lovells are behind the idea of the app, it was developed by a partner company that the firm has worked with on past apps and its own website.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As of late, a spate of law firms have released apps to address compliance concerns for various regulations. Similar to other technology, some have questioned what sort of impact these apps could have on a lawyer's role. Ustaran noted that though many may see device-delivery apps as a threat, he finds the viewpoint &quot;very short-sighted.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Technology can be used to help you demonstrate your expertise,&quot; he said. &quot;The app is there to demonstrate our expertise, not just in the law but in how to take a complex problem and then provide a simple solution. ... It's always a way of testing the means at your disposal, the same way one lawyer one day to use a fax instead of a letter.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facebook Inc. received one of its biggest regulatory slaps last week when European antitrust regulators fined it $122 million for providing misleading statements about its 2014 purchase of WhatsApp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fine is relatively small compared to Facebook's annual profits-the Menlo Park, California-based social media giant pulled in more than $10 billion in profit in 2016-but it does signal a more aggressive regulatory environment in the region. The same week Facebook received its European Commission fine, French and Dutch regulators claimed the company broke local data protection rules. French regulators levied a much smaller fine to the company of 150,000 euros, or about $167,000 at Tuesday's rate of exchange.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Doron Goldstein, partner at Katten Muchin Rosenman and co-head of the firm's privacy, data and cybersecurity practice, spoke with reporter David Ruiz about what the European Commission's fine means for American companies, private practice lawyers and corporate expansion into Europe. He also spoke about how Europe's new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)-data protection rules currently rolling out across the several member-states-plays a role in more aggressive enforcement efforts.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The following interview has been edited for clarity and length.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7"> Q: What are your main takeaways when looking at this fine against Facebook?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: There are two interesting lessons from this. One interesting piece is that it came from the competition office, not from the privacy office, so it shows the interaction between [the two offices]. It shows the concern the European Commission has for privacy issues that this actually became a big enough issue within the competition bureau to levy this type of fine. That interaction is interesting. The second is that it shows a very clear trend on the part of the European Commission to very actively enforce privacy-related issues and to start going for aggressive fines. I think it's an interesting example, and I think it's something worth noting in light of what the GDPR allows, when that comes into effect, in terms of the size of the fines. In this case, the commissioners could have imposed an even larger fine on Facebook. They made it somewhat smaller than the maximum they were entitled to, because Facebook cooperated. But it, again, does show that the commission is likely to be aggressive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7"> Q: What does a more aggressive European Commission mean for American companies with international headquarters already in Europe?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: This is essentially consistent with the message that privacy professionals in the U.S. and in Europe have been saying for years, in particular, since the GDPR was passed. Europe has a very different perspective on privacy and on data protection and we have to take that into account as companies plan how to interact with residents of Europe-with their customers, their clients, the parties they deal with in Europe. The commission is aggressive and has a very different perspective [on privacy] and it looks at it purely from a consumer perspective, from an individual perspective. Earlier that week, the French and Dutch data protection authorities also had claims against Facebook. The fine from [Commission Nationale de L'informatique et des Libert&eacute;s], which is the French authority, was 150,000 euros. It was a very small fine, but again, these [claims] are for failure to properly disclose. The lessons that come out of this are, one, you have to think about what the expectation is from a European perspective. The second-and this is consistent with the U.S. as well-is that your disclosures have to be clear and complete.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7"> Q: Has this always been the understood bargain for companies looking to expand to Europe-that they trade market expansion for a stricter regulatory environment?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: To some degree yes. To some degree no. The difference has been, until recently, that the enforcement by the European Commission has been relatively light. There have been a few, but the enforcement has not been very strong and the fines have been small, in relative terms. The example of fining Facebook 150,000 euro, that's a very different fine from $122 million [110 million euro]. There's a scale difference that goes into the expectation going forward that there are now going to be real fines. Part of that comes with the authority that the GDPR has granted in terms of data protection, for fines up to 20 million euro or 4 percent of global turnover, and it's the greater of those two. Those are real fines they have the ability to impose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7"> Q: Do you think these changes will make companies reconsider setting up shop in Europe?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: I don't think so. Europe is obviously a large market</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Obviously, companies make those business determinations every day as to whether going into a particular market makes sense, because there are a whole series of issues that go into that. Language is one. Do you want to translate everything into local languages? There are a lot of reasons that go into it. Do I think [regulatory enforcement] will be a factor that goes into it? Yes. But I assume it, to some degree, always was. Will it be a greater factor? Probably. I think it will be given a somewhat greater weight and it may delay some European rollouts as companies try to make sure that their policies and practices are consistent with what is required.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7"> Q: How does this affect private practice?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: It's important. It means that operating even just in the U.S., we have to be able to take those things into account, and we have to prepare our clients for the fact that if they want to do things that have an external U.S. element, they have to plan early. That's particularly true with [information technology] projects of any kind, whether a website or an app they're developing or some kind of service being offered. If there's a likelihood that is going to be crossing the ocean at some point, that it will go into Europe, it's something that we have to raise now, right at the start of the process. As opposed to the way I think historically things have been done, which is, you think about countries as you go into them. It's now become a much earlier part of the thought process. The concept of privacy by design has now expanded to some degree, when I talk with clients, into privacy and EU compliance by design. You're thinking about those two things at the same time, because re-engineering after you have developed the system, developed the service, implemented the project, is much more difficult than considering those points at the beginning.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What's the latest on Brexit? When the UK government triggers Article 50, it will signal the start of the official two-year countdown until the UK leaves the European Union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While there are still many unknowns in regards to geopolitical policies and legislation that will be created, annulled, or abolished post-Brexit, the UK government has given away one handy hint when it comes to the now-infamousGeneral Data Protection Regulation(GDPR).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This means that from May 2018, when the UK is still an EU member, the GDPR will be applicable to UK businesses. And, even when the UK exits the EU in 2019, an identical version of the GDPR will also be enforced.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Needless to say, this isn't good news for UK organizations that have been burying their heads in the sand, hoping that this pesky EU legislation will just go away post-Brexit. Unfortunately, these rules aren't going anywhere. It's time for companies to wake up to the consequence of data negligence regarding the GDPR. This isn't just infosecurity providers scaremongering for sales, and it's not a &quot;~potential' occurrence like the Y2K bug, this is actually happening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Get your ducks in a row, or get fined</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Should a sensitive data breach occur under the GDPR, the European Data Protection Board (or likely the Information Commissioner's Office, post-Brexit) will evaluate whether the affected company has been negligent in its data protection operations and the level of compensation a company must pay affected parties-which can reach \xE2,\xAC20m or a fine of up to four percent of its global turnover. Not a pretty thought for the C-suite, which by nature is tasked with mitigating risk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Concerningly, according to Code42's 2016 Datastrophe Study, in which over 400 UK IT decision makers (ITDMs) were surveyed, 50 percent of them acknowledged that the security measures they have in place currently will not be enough to meet GDPR standards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How to become compliant</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first step is for an organization to know what kind of data falls under GDPR protection, where it is stored, and for how long it should be kept. Moreover, what is the best way to secure it, to what extent that data should be backed up, and how to prevent any leaks from the inside of the company. Simple, right?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The implementation of the right endpoint security stack is vital-one that takes into consideration first-line defense, such as intrusion detection systems and antivirus solutions, right down to last line defense, to easily remediate and recover should a breach occur. The right solution is an important advantage given the number of people and devices accessing potentially sensitive corporate information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also, enterprises should create internal policies that promote accessibility and flexibility with approved solutions, without locking the enterprise down to the point of stifling productivity. Employees play a big role regarding the sanctity of corporate information. That is why it is vital to train and educate your staff about possible intrusions, how they can secure data themselves, and how to avoid being tricked into leaking sensitive information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taking these precautions will allow an organization to gain control of its own information and ensure that the CIO's overall focus is on increasing profit and expanding technological reach, rather than worrying about the safety of the zeroes and ones.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While upper management has overall admitted it is indeed worried about the current state of cybersecurity, it still sometimes fails to take (the right course of) action. This is a fact once more highlighted by the results of a study conducted by NewAlpha Asset Management.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recently (this is a relative term here, we surely count the evolution in years), a climate of digital anxiety has settled among professionals and individuals alike. A focus group coordinated by NewAlpha questioned the representatives of 9 companies and revealed that 77.78% of executives consider IT security to be a main concern for their business. BUT (there's always a &quot;but&quot; in every story), while entrepreneurs have become increasingly aware of the issue, positive results are slow to appear. Indeed, the number of cyber attacks recorded at a global scale last yearstill spikedas opposed to 2015. While awareness campaigns only intensified over the course of 2016, how can we justify this contrasting image?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The same study showed that one-third of the respondents were quite unsure whereas the impact of a vulnerability on their system would be. On top of that, some even failed to see why data protection is even necessary. It is the typical speech: &quot;I have nothing to hide, we are completely transparent, etc. etc.&quot;. Online identity theft and targeted phishing campaigns are just a few of the counter-arguments that come to mind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So here it is: CEOs have finally taken note that there is a problem and, to our delight, they immediately respond: &quot;Yes, we have allocated a budget to the security of our servers&quot; and &quot;Yes, we have indeed implemented a cybersecurity solution&quot;. All this is going in the right direction, but the study lacks some precision. While 100% said they are not willing to pay a ransom that is more than 10,000 Euros, it is not clear how much they have set aside for the purpose of securing their infrastructure or even what type of &quot;cybersecurity solution&quot; they put in place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The battle is not over</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That being said, it would appear that awareness raising efforts are yet to generate conscious and personalized actions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, the repetitive discourse that we often find in the media when cybersecurity topics are at a peak has failed to put sufficient emphasis on one essential aspect: good IT security practices are merely guidelines that must be adapted by each of us, and not treated with inflexibility. What works for a business is not necessarily the optimal solution for another. We should all have the same basic ingredients, but the recipe, the implementation process, that may require a completely different approach according to one's needs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cybersecurity experts should aspire to help company managers no longer perceive IT security tools as a Swiss knife. &quot;~I have an antivirus, isn't that enough?' or even &quot;~I have a SIEM, why would I also need a firewall?'. All these solutions are essential components meant to help us resist hacking perils. Together, they form an impenetrable armor. But remove one part and it won't take long before the black hats find your weakness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When all is said and done, what is left to be done? Go beyond vague terms. Take advantage of the recent major changes that will become effective in May 2018 and reevaluate what state-of-the-art cybersecurity means for you. We are of course talking here about the new rules introduced by the European Union within the General Data Protection Regulation (otherwise known as the GDPR). The latter guarantees citizens that their personal data will be processed according to required standards and that, in the case of a notable incident, they will be notified within the following 72 hours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For those who have read the actual law, you will have, without a doubt, noticed one thing: the Member States of the European Union have avoided specifying precise means of implementing these obligations. Which is quite understandable since its application is willing conceived as to be able to withhold the changes of time. However, the passages can always be translated using the technological advances of the present (read our previous article that talks about our SOC Reveelium here).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As such, it is imperative to prepare for the imminent implementation of these regulations. Obligations imposed on companies have increased considerably, as have penalties. It is therefore urgent to plan inventories and audit the way businesses are processing data, in addition to supplementing security with its missing elements. All this will surely have to be followed by the establishment of conduct rules and policies, as well as more training programs. The end goal? Move on from cybersecurity awareness to an informed action-taking attitude.</SPAN></P>

Out of this exceptional population, however, some people stand out.

Off the top of his head, he could tell you about the latest security breaches, new strains of malware, recently developed exploit kits, or hacker banter on the dark web. He was continually working on something with law enforcement organizations such as the FBI or Interpol so he couldn't always share details, but even his high-level cybercrime descriptions could make the hair on your neck stand up.&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Raimund was a true citizen of the world. It seemed like every time I saw him, he had just flown in from a trip that included a worldwide tour. This gave him a broad perspective on cybersecurity issues and strategies and a gift for sharing these experiences. He taught me about cybersecurity education in Korea, cybercrime in Brazil and regulations in Europe. For example, last October he educated a group of American cybersecurity analysts on impending requirements around GDPR. Since this visit, many of his predications have come true, and his recommendations were always sound.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<DIV CLASS="c12"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In spite of his knowledge, CTO position and global schedule, Raimund was completely down to earth and a straight shooter. As money and hyperbole flowed into the cybersecurity technology market, Raimund wasn't afraid to call BS. He would always tell you what he thought and why without any hint of industry or organizational spin. And Raimund didn't take himself too seriously. He could talk about polymorphic malware in one sentence and then leave you laughing with a joke in the next.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Raimund was the whole package-extremely smart, charming, energetic, fun and engaging-which is why you couldn't help but like him, appreciate his knowledge and enjoy his company. He was a great ambassador for the cybersecurity professional diaspora.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My heart goes out to all of Trend Micro. Raimund was a spiritual and irreplaceable leader at the company who will be sorely missed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As sad as I am about his passing, I will always think of Raimund with a smile on my face. Rest in peace, my friend, you made the cybersecurity community and this little planet a better place while you were here.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just after a few months since the European Parliament approved thefinal versionof the newGeneral Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the European Commission is working on updating yet another set of privacy rules. The European Commissionpublished a new textthat, when approved, will replace the currentePrivacy Directive: the EU law that ensures confidentiality of communication and the protection of personal data in the electronic communications sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the Commission plans to complete the reform process quickly enough to allow the new law to come into force in May 2018 together with the GDPR, the road ahead is long and tortuous. In fact, both the EU Councils of Ministers and the EU Parliament must agree and approve the final text.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While EU policy makers aspire to finalize a new version of the ePrivacy Directive that goes hand-in-hand with the GDPR, it's a task for all companies to updatetheir processes, technology, workforce's expertise, and oversight mechaninsmsto comply with both sets of rules. To meet compliance requirements consistently and without redundancies, it's crucial that firms understand what's changing and how ahead of time. According to the proposed text, the new ePrivacy law will:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Be a regulation. As the GDPR, the updated version of the ePrivacy Directive will be a regulation. This means that one single law will apply to all countries of the European Union. It's good news for firms doing business across Europe, as they will not need to struggle with 27 different versions of the rules.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Have fines up to 4%. In line with the GDPR, also the new regulation will include fine up to \xE2,\xAC20 million, or 4% of companies' annual global turnover, whichever is the highest. This is one more reason for firms to treat the updated version of the ePrivacy Directive with the same rigor as the GDPR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Reach companies beyond telcos. The new rules will apply not only to traditional telcos, but also to providers of electronic communications services, including internet access, instant messaging applications, e-mail, internet phone calls, and personal messaging provided through social media. Practically, all firms that provide Europeans with products such as text messaging and calls, including OTT companies - those that use an internet connection to provide communication services, will face the same regulations as standard telecoms groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Require explicit consent to process data of costumers' communication. Companies that wish to engage in processing customers' data from their voice or internet communications, such as, for example, scanning their emails to serve personalized advertisements, will need to consult the supervisory authority (the data protection authority in most cases) beforehand and gather explicit consent from customers to do so. Firms will also need explicit consent to process metadata, such as duration of calls and their location, to provide additional services to their customers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Make it more difficult to track customers' online activities. Companies that wish to access information stored on customers' devices and terminal equipment can do that upon customers' consent and for transparent and specific purposes. But firms that place simple cookies for purposes such as measuring traffic on a website will not need to gather users' permission. For tracking cookies - especially third-party cookies, in line with the principle of privacy by-design contained in the GDPR, the updated text of the ePrivacy Directive requires web browsers to ask users whether they want to allow websites to place cookies on their browsers upon installation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Call for transparent notices when tracking customers' physical activities. Firms that scan their customers' physical devices to know, for example, how many people are in a queue or whether a new customer is entering their shop, must inform customers about this activity. Notices must contain information about the extension of the area where the tracking takes place, why, who is responsible for the initiative, and also how the customer can take control over the tracking, including opting out of it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Give new rights to users. Users can object to the processing of their communication data. The law also allows for potential compensation of users that suffered material or no-material damage as a result of the infringement of the rules.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TELEF&Oacute;NICA MADE A BIG PROMISE of more privacy control for its mobile subscribers last week, announcing a platform called Aura to show them the data they generate as they use its services. The company, one of the world's largest telecom carriers, will also offer incentives-&quot;peace of mind, improved experiences or personal rewards,&quot; as a spokesman put it-in exchange for letting it share their data with third parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The news matters because mobile carriers around the world are increasingly trying to turn their customer data into a new, powerful tool for marketers. Telef&oacute;nica and others are already opening certain raw data to companies dedicated to helping carriers cash in on subscriber info. But consumer consent will likely be key if carriers are going to deliver for marketers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With margins diminishing on their core product-voice and data services for subscribers-telecoms have begun seeking revenue from data about subscribers, said Mark Grether, a former executive at programmatic ad firm Xaxis and an investor in Zeotap, a startup in the space. &quot;So my core business becomes a means to an end,&quot; Mr. Grether said. &quot;That's the kind of mental shift that I'm seeing in the telco industry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though carriers are in testing mode, the burgeoning telco data sector and millions of dollars in recent startup funding signals a near future in which marketers can capitalize on higher-quality data than they get today. It isn't just quintessentially &quot;mobile&quot; location data: Carriers have names, addresses, bill totals and more. Even though the data is stripped of personal identifiers, it can build rich profiles for ad targeting and measurement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a campaign for Mercedes with Publicis Groupe's Zenith Espa&ntilde;a, for example, Zeotap built consumer clusters based on their monthly bills in the hopes of targeting people who could afford the luxury E-Class sedan. Zeotap said it has also recently worked with Publicis on behalf of Samsung and Interpublic Group for Johnson &amp; Johnson, among others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The startups argue that their access and technology yields consumer information that others can't match. &quot;They're specialists for sure,&quot; said Rich Karpinski, principal analyst of mobile operator strategies at 451 Research. &quot;They have expertise in taking this data in and normalizing it and cleaning it up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Telcos themselves have explored a variety of ways to take more advantage of their data. Verizon, Sprint and AT&amp;T have built divisions to provide marketing insights and enable easy ad targeting of their subscribers. And Verizon's moves to buy AOL and Yahoo are predicated on pumping its data into their ad systems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Telco data analytics firm Intersec has helped Telef&oacute;nica and its U.K. carrier O2 put subscribers' location data to use for ads aimed at geofenced areas. The firm also has worked with French telecom Orange and Zain, a carrier serving Middle Eastern countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zeotap's deals with telcos in North America, Europe and India have sparked interest from other players. Smartpipe Solutions says it works with four mobile operators in Egypt, Indonesia, India and the Czech Republic, and is deploying its technology in Britain. Teralytics provides an analytics platform to carriers and helps connect their data with high-tech ad marketplaces or other entities to make revenue from ads, traffic management or financial analytics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The young guns Zeotap, Smartpipe and Teralytics won't name many or any telco partners. &quot;We are relatively discreet about that,&quot; said Smartpipe co-founder Tobin Ireland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What's no secret is that telcos risk consumer backlash if they don't communicate their data-sharing relationships well. Another challenge is the constraints on incentives they might offer. &quot;We haven't seen many operators yet that successfully built a meaningful opt-in base due to lack of real incentives for subscribers to do so,&quot; said Teralytics CEO Georg Polzer. &quot;The operators' core business is still too strong to let them offer, for example, meaningful discounts on monthly contract payments.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mobile customers typically don't know when carriers do share their data. Zeotap says partners notify their subscribers through their websites, print statements and other means. In other words, subscribers are not likely to get a hard-to-miss notice on their phones. One carrier working with Teralytics offers a discount for subscribers who agree to share the data they generate, though Teralytics is not named, according to Mr. Polzer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The telcos should give their consumers meaningful options,&quot; said Jarno Vanto, a data privacy and ad tech lawyer at Polsinelli. &quot;The end user, the consumer, is completely out of the equation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While consumers aren't usually getting what watchdogs and regulators call prominent, meaningful notification, regulations are uneven and a bit fluid. The Federal Communications Commission is likely to become more permissive under the Trump administration. But the EU's General Data Protection Regulation rules coming next year require opt-in consent from consumers before sharing data with third parties. &quot;Our privacy principles are completely aligned with GDPR,&quot; the Telef&oacute;nica spokesman said. &quot;With every third party, Telef&oacute;nica ensures that data remains secure, privacy is protected, and only the minimum insights are shared with third parties to deliver the service the user has subscribed to.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vol. 1</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">No. 1</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During my February 22, 2017 webinarThe Gartner Enterprise Information Management Maturity Model(replay available), attendees asked a number of excellent questions. Not able to answer them all during the session, I promised to address them in my blog.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q. We're just starting on the EIM journey with a new CIO and data and analytics Leader. How does the accountability and ownership best split between the roles given the opportunity to establish from a blank page?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Doug Laney: In my upcoming Infonomics book (due out in September), I include a set of &quot;Generally Accepted Information Principles&quot; (using the GAAP framework). One of those is the &quot;Optimization Principle&quot; which states: The business is responsible for optimizing the usage and understanding of information; the information management organization is responsible for optimizing information's availability and utility; and IT is responsible for optimizing information's accessibility and protection. I think establishing this triumvirate is an ideal starting point for defining the delineation of responsibilities. Of course you'll want to discuss, negotiate and further refine each of these at a lower level of detail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q. Do you recommend or have an opinion on the DAMA DMBOK as far as applying it to an EIM program?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Laney: The DMBOK is an excellent resource (as is DAMA). I find it very functionally-rich, but lacking some alignment across functions, and missing things like vision and metrics and overall EIM strategy. Ultimately the DMBOK is a fine EIM process checklist with detail on each of the functions. But it falls short in defining and how to coordinate an overall EIM program. Others like the CMM DMMM, the EDM Council MM, and MIKE 2.0 (based on my Meta Group work over a decade ago) also lack program/coordination and components for vision, life cycle, organization and roles, or even key activities like MDM. Some also lack incremental improvement recommendations or a self-assessment tool. But more than anything, these other models are not backed by 1000s of related research publications, as is Gartner's model. Of course I'm biased.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q. Who should lead the EIM program: - CDO? - IT? - Business/Finance?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Laney: Ideally yes, a CDO or someone with executive level authority and resources. And an effective EIM program must coordinate across IT and business units effectively, so placing the CDO within one of those two can be suboptimal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q. What would be the reason not to consider information as a true asset? There seems to be money to be made if they do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Laney: Interesting question. One argument I've heard for the accounting profession not to consider information as a balance sheet asset is that it's too difficult to measure the value of, and because it can be too easily copied, its ownership and control (key asset criteria) are difficult to ascertain. From an organizational perspective, not accounting for information allows information-centric companies to compile, generate and deploy information without disclosing it publicly. It also drives higher market-to-book valuations for info-centric companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q. What scope / deliverables should an EIM Phase 1 project have? (3 month delivery horizon?)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Laney: First, as I mentioned during the webinar, EIM is not a &quot;project&quot; per se. Rather it is an overall program approach for coordinating various information-related capabilities. That said, you have to start somewhere, right? So I'd suggest adopting the framework and laying out the components would be a great start. Use ourEnterprise Information Management Program Templateto flesh out your approach. Next, I'd suggest sorting out key roles and responsibilities, and an overarching set of principles for EIM that everyone, including the business and IT, can agree upon. In my upcoming Infonomics book (Sept), I lay out a set of &quot;Generally Accepted Information Principles&quot; gleaned from reviewing 100s of clients' data strategy documents, and drawing upon key asset management principles from other disciplines. I'm happy to discuss and share these individually with clients any time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q. Hello, do you view regulation (such as the EU GDPR) as a barrier to achieving maturity in this area or perhaps as a factor that we need to work smarter to deliver better controls and thereby achieve better information management?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Laney: On one hand, achieving regulatory compliance can detract from achieving direct economic benefits from information. On the other hand, many organizations use regulatory compliance as an impetus or imperative for overall information management improvements, including the hiring of a CDO, formalizing data governance, minimizing data extracts, improving data security, etc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q. How do you recommend to implement the EIM program - with fully dedicated resources or can it be implemented with sort of virtual team across the organization?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Laney: The most successful EIM programs we see involve a core team of individuals&quot;sometimes just a handful within the office of the CDO, and other times an entire 1000-person information management organization&quot;plus coordination across business units and IT. Rarely, for example, do we see full-time dedicated data stewards. They are usually part of a virtual team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q. Wondering where can we find the papers on how to quantify the value of data?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Laney: An overview of our information valuation models can be found in the blog:Why and How to Value Your Information as an Asset. The models themselves including guidance on how to do the calculations and adapt them is in the Gartner research publication:Why and How to Measure the Value of Your Information Assets. My upcoming Infonomics book (September) will also include details on the models.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q. I find making the leap from legacy data products to modern products challenging because the organization is entrenched in perceived value of legacy products. Is there a good test to measuring the actual utility of a data product?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Laney: I think &quot;fit for purpose&quot; is the operative expression here. What are your objectives in terms of functionality, performance, ease of use, flexibility, scalability, cost, etc.? And how would you quantify these? Having a well-defined vision and set of associated metrics can be useful in identifying if and when legacy technologies are reaching their end-of-life. As I mentioned during the webinar, &quot;user satisfaction&quot; is a poor proxy for value.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q. How are governments and for example police departments seeing information as assets?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Laney: Public sector, especially in the US is a bit of an exception. Rather than the information assets belonging to these kinds of organizations, it is part of the public trust (security and privacy notwithstanding). The Freedom of Information Act assures this, and recent open data mandates ensure the improved utility of information both within these organizations, and by others. FOIA prohibits government organizations in the US from selling or licensing information, but there are clever ways to monetize it internally and externally (e.g. via public-private partnerships). Government organizations in other countries are not so constrained. E.g., Gartner Consulting worked with another country's national archives to determine the market value of digitizing certain artifacts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q. Could you please provide some case examples on how some companies (preferably in Fin Services) have successfully used the EIM maturity model or a similar framework, wholly/ partially?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Laney: We have a library of dozens of examples of how organizations in every industry and geography have innovated with information. Many of them, however, focus on outcomes and economic benefits rather than the intricacies of how information is managed. For interested clients, you can submit aninquiryrequest to have me send you a selection of these real world stories.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q. A question on governance. Can you brief more on the &quot;Eliminate notion of data ownership&quot;. I was thinking ownership of data is in line with governance principles and thus comes the accountability of data owners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Laney: It's mostly a matter of semantics. Using the term &quot;ownership&quot; perpetuates the notion of data siloes and hoarding. Language is important, as my colleague Valerie Logan has recently written about. (SeeInformation as a Second Language: Enabling Data Literacy for Digital Society.) To maximize information's value to the organization, it should be perceived, discussed and treated as an enterprise asset. However, of course you are right that governance is no-less important. Still, I personally prefer to see words like &quot;trustee&quot; used to designate an individual (or group) with authority over policies related to an information asset. Going a step further, the role of a fiduciary might fit as well. A fiduciary is someone with a contractual and ethical obligation for the well-being of an asset or portfolio of assets (typically financial assets, but just as applicable to information assets).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q. What size companies benefit from a formal EIM practice? We are 1,800 employees, $1B revenue, a public utility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Laney: Remember, EIM is a program or initiative. It does not specify the size or scope of information assets being managed or the requisite size of the organization. At its core, it's a framework applicable to any size organization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q. Information or data - interchangeable or important distinction?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Laney: Generally, I use the term &quot;information&quot; to refer to any and all forms of data or content, structured or unstructured, raw or processed. However, tacit information (a.k.a. &quot;knowledge&quot; or &quot;wisdom&quot;) is a different topic altogether as it does not meet the conditions of a true asset, and therefore cannot be monetized, managed or measured as one. Also, in most circumstances I consider the &quot;data vs. information&quot; argument to be pedantic, and &quot;turning data into information&quot; type phraseology to be trite marketing speak. Information's potential value is more of a continuum. Ultimately, one person's data is another person's information. It's contextual, and it's a continuum. So making some artificial designation doesn't really help much.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q. If you focus a lot on data does this focus cause a problem for organisation which are records/document-centric?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Laney: Again, I think all information, whether structured or unstructured, electronic or printed, or raw or derived, can benefit from the same kind of asset management discipline and EIM program. I'd like to see the day in which all forms of data/information/content/records are managed under some unified approach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q. I've noticed that a lot of EIM initiatives (and data governance, generally) tend to focus exclusively on data storage, ignoring data model standardization at the API / services layer. What are your thoughts on this?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Laney: Very good point. The Gartner perspective is that information architecture (including models and APIs and service layers) spans each of the EIM dimensions. I have been lobbying for information architecture to have its own EIM dimension, and would certainly support any organization that takes this approach. I agree with you that it is important enough to warrant a distinct high level capability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q. How do you manage the tension between consistency across the dimensions and the need for data scientist to grab info prior to enterprise rationalization?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Laney: Ah, the age-old conundrum of expediency versus formality! Actually, your EIM strategy and data governance precepts should specify if/when/how data can be used before it is cataloged, cleansed, certified, integrated, and loaded into an enterprise data store (e.g. data warehouse, data lake, etc.). Or it should specify particular sandboxes for data R&amp;D and experimentation. And governance policies should specify the degree to which that data can be used in any operational or strategic sense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cybersecurity is in the news everyday now - and that is certainly going to continue. It is frequently noted by experts that being compliant does not mean secure, but by instituting regulations you will encourage those organizations that have done very little to begin down the path to becoming more secure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York State is taking the lead in creating serious Cybersecurity regulations and they are targeting financial firms to start. The NY State Department of Financial Services (DFS) initially proposed regulations that were to take effect on January 1, but after reviewing input from a number of the affected organizations; they have made modifications and the new effective date is March 1.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This &quot;first in nation&quot; regulation will require banks, insurance companies, and other financial services institutions regulated by DFS to establish and maintain a cybersecurity program designed to protect consumers and ensure the safety and soundness of New York State's financial services industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The overall vision of this legislation looks to create an environment where the companies covered by DFS will have better controls of the Information Systems and Nonpublic Information that they have; reduce risks from Cyber events; and present a framework for reporting and validation of the programs outlined in the legislation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the most important and significant programs that covered institutions must have in place is a valid Cybersecurity Program. This plan outlines not only what information the organization has; who has access; but what efforts are necessary to control and secure the data and systems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By conducting a Risk Assessment, the organization can identify what areas of the regulations they need to comply with. There are many components of the regulations that depend on what the risk profile of the organization looks like in determining the policies and procedures that would need to be implemented and followed to insure compliance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Cyber program must identify and assess internal and external risks; use defensive policies and procedures to prevent unauthorized access and use; and detect, respond, recover and report on any events. By implementing a Cybersecurity Policy that includes more than a dozen areas that need to be addressed, from internally focused categories to third party management; there are a significant number of complex policies and procedures that must be outlined, implemented and approved by senior members or boards of the covered entity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To insure compliance and implementation of these policies and programs, DFS is requiring that a Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), be identified and that he or she is responsible for not only implementing the appropriate programs, policies and procedures, but must also report to the governing board of the organization to the effectiveness of the program and any Cyber events that have taken place. The CISO must be a &quot;qualified individual&quot; that has been designated by the covered entity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inclusive of the plan there needs to be penetration testing; auditing; application security; and training of qualified staff. Additionally, the covered entity must ensure that Third Party Providers that have access to a covered entity's Information Systems and Nonpublic Information have equal controls and practices to ensure that the covered entity's systems and data are fully secure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The regulation has outlined requirements for Multi-Factor Authentication; data retention; encryption; training and Incident Response.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a comprehensive regulation that outlines specifics for the covered entities. Most large institutions will already have most of these programs and policies in place. But, a significant number of organizations will not have the qualified staff to create, institute and manage these programs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fortunately, the DFS is allowing them to utilize third parties to handle that for them. While the responsibility still falls to the covered entity, they can engage with outside providers to put these programs in place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These programs are not easily prepared or executed. The regulation reaches into many areas, from general data governance to specifics about penetration testing. A comprehensive plan cannot be created from some on-line template nor can a risk assessment be done through a simple tool.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As stated in the regulation a &quot;qualified&quot; individual must oversee these programs and state to their board and DFS that appropriate measures are in place and that they are effective. This is not a job for your System Administrator that helps when your email goes down or you can't print.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given the complexity and broad scope of the regulation it would be most appropriate for organizations that do not have the talent on staff or significant IT security teams to engage an outside firm to create, implement, manage and report on the variety of detailed components of the regulation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similar to the regulations that are forthcoming in the EU around General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR); these regulations are the first of what we would presume to be many that will be coming to the US. It's not only financial firms that will be covered, they are but the first, it is clear that many other organizations have vulnerable systems and nonpublic information that needs to be secured.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">by Jonathan Braude</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1100 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Look ahead to May 1, 2018. On that day, sixteen months from now, the European Union's new General Data Protection Regulation comes into force. It's a big deal. A company hit by a data breach - perhaps as a result of hacking by criminals or because a disgruntled former employee posted the human resources department's entire database of sensitive personal details on the Internet in the act of revenge - will face a fine of up to &amp;#8364;20 million ($21.4 million) or 4% of global sales whichever is the higher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Failure to have adequate systems in place to avoid such a breach could still cost up to 2% of global sales or &amp;#8364;10 million. Almost inevitably the target will have to cope with the loss of reputation and likely loss of customers as well, destroying value both immediately and in the longer term.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And as Robert Maddox, of Debevoise &amp; Plimpton LLP's White Collar &amp; Regulatory Defense team and Cybersecurity and Data Privacy practice, pointed out, there's a fine line between being seen as a victim or a villain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If a company is hacked it is the victim of a crime,&quot; he said. &quot;But if it subsequently transpires that they had inadequate safeguards in place to protect their customers' data, that sympathy can be swiftly eroded.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. investors should not underestimate the risk. According to Rohan Massey, who leads the Privacy and Data Security practice in Europe at Ropes &amp; Gray LLP, there are fewer restrictions in the U.S. on what personal data companies can collect on their customers or employees, despite the limits on finance data set by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, for instance, or on health data by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountancy Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you go into a general retail store in the US they can ask you for everything,&quot; he said. &quot;Name, address, shoe size. There's nothing regulating what they're going to do with that information; nothing saying what they have to tell you they're going to do with it. In Europe, we're very different to that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the GDPR, sensitive personal information can include details of your health, sexual orientation, religious beliefs, political affiliation, trade union membership, but also your name and address. Financial data might, counter-intuitively perhaps, count as less sensitive. But the law is built on risk of harm. So if your name, address and bank account details were all leaked together, the risk of damage would be high, and a company would be under a duty to notify the regulator that a breach had occurred.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet a recent survey commissioned by analytics firm LogRhythm, traffic visibility company Gigamon and network security firm Forescout Technologies - and widely quoted in the technology press here - came to the conclusion that two-thirds of British businesses are not yet prepared to comply with the GDPR or the closely related Network and Information Security directive when they come into effect next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps the thought that they are not alone will be of comfort to the several private equity firms, large and small, geographically focused and global, that were contacted for this article. All either declined to comment, said they had no experience of the matter or ultimately failed to come up with anyone internally who was able to shed light on the firm's preparations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But sixteen months is not long. A private equity company looking at an investment over the next few months would be failing in its duty to its investors, if it failed to include data security in its due diligence or the representations and warranties, it allows a portfolio company to provide when it is selling a business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moreover, many private equity firms have significant data of their own either regarding their portfolio companies or their own clients, which could attract the attention of hackers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And there could be doubt about how the new regulations may affect financial investors. According to the Information Commissioner's Office, which regulates data protection in Britain, it is the company itself, as managed by its directors or board, which will be the legal entity with responsibility as data controller.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The shareholders of the company will have no liability in respect of any data protection breach committed by the company,&quot; an ICO spokeswoman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nor, according to Maddox, does the GDPR impose any obligation on a parent company relating to a subsidiary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Massey is not so sure. He said the regulation had been drafted with an eye to the EU's previous experience with anti-trust law, where it had been able to go after parent companies and related investors. The GDPR talked about fines being levied on the &quot;undertaking,&quot; a concept he said was defined vaguely in the European treaties, but developed under anti-trust case law as being a linked economic unit which exercised active and decisive control or influence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One thought that I had,&quot; he said, &quot;was that this has been done deliberately to avoid issues whereby technology companies have very big U.S. databases and sales, but have very small satellite businesses in Europe and are running any claim [against them] through those businesses. The regulators want to be able to go after the U.S. business as well.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Calling this a &quot;stealth&quot; aspect of the legislation, he argued that as well as catching big technology companies - such as Google - there could be broader applicability to private equity owners as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new regulation was passed into law at EU level in May 2016, although the member states, including, for now, the United Kingdom, have until next year to bring it into force. It was intended to harmonize what are currently 28 different regimes. But France has opted to bring it in early and some will likely enforce the law with more ferocity than others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brexit, when it comes, in 2019 or after, is unlikely to reduce the U.K.'s commitment to enforcement of a law very similar to that in force in Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Said Michael Briggs, a member of the data protection team at British law firm Shoosmiths LLP, &quot;Regardless of how the GDPR is redrafted or modified in years to come, UK data protection legislation will, at the very least, be required to harmonize with EU provisions in order for it to remain commercially and legally competitive and compatible.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, it remains an open question whether companies will be able to turn to the U.K. regulator as a one-stop-shop for its operations throughout the European Union or whether the European Commission will withdraw what is known as an &quot;adequacy decision&quot; regarding the U.K.'s regulation post-Brexit, forcing companies to register with separate regulators inside and outside the E.U.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">DEAL SIZE</SPAN><BR></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That law, introduced in 2009, resulted in websites displaying a banner to visitors from the European Union asking them if they would allow a cookie to be placed in their browser - even thoughmost browsers already offer a way for users to indicate, site by site or globally, whether they will accept such cookies or not.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the Interactive Advertising Bureau (whose members have an obvious incentive to cookie and track asmany web users as possible), the new rules would &quot;undeniably damage&quot; their business model by forcing users to &quot;more actively deal with constant requests for permission for the use of harmless cookies when visiting websites and using other digital services&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dautlich said that responsible marketers would welcome the stiffer penalties framework that the Commission has proposed for infringements of e-Privacy rules, which mirrors that which applies under the GDPR. It extends some of the rules governing telecoms operators to so-called over-the-top services, while also allowing telecom companies to use customermetadata - such as the duration and location of calls - to provide additional services and makemore money, something they are barred from doing under the current rules.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the beginning of the formal legislative process and now the draft is in the hands of the European Parliament and the Council of the EU.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A copy of the upcoming Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulation leaked early in December, but only yesterday has theEuropean Commission acknowledged its legitimacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It said privacy would be guaranteed for both the content andmetadata in electronic messages. Our draft ePrivacy Regulation strikes the right balance: &quot;it provides a high level of protection for consumers, while allowing businesses to innovate&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AndrusAnsip, vice-president for the Digital Single Market, was quoted as saying: &quot;Our proposals will deliver the trust in the Digital Single Market that people expect. Cookies set by a visited website counting the number of visitors to that website will no longer require consent&quot;, it stated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first category includes cookies used to remember shopping history, the last position of your scroll bar, UI color preferences, and similar non-privacy related settings. Also seeking users consent every time before sending an advertisement would be very burdensome.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Privacy advocates say the new ePrivacy regulation, which is an updated version of a 1995 directive that allowed for some differences in national law, complements a broad data protection overhaul that was rubberstamped past year and will go into effect in 2018. The proposal is created to protectpersonal data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For this reason, ETNO and the GSMA call for legislators to ensure that the final Regulation takes into account new services and that all providers are subject to the same rules.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The European data protection legislation adopted a year ago sets high standards for the benefit of both EU citizens and companies&quot;, said EC justice chief Vera Jourov&aacute;.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the last five years, there has been a marked shift in how businesses view cybersecurity. As evidence, cybersecurity spending has soared. By year's end,Gartner predictsworldwide information security spending will reach $81.6 billion (7.9 percent over the record-breaking 2015 figure), andCybersecurity Ventures projects$1 trillion will be spent globally on cybersecurity between 2017 and 2021.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Embarrassing and costly data breaches have been a hazard of business since the rise of the internet, and many government and industry regulations have carried fees for non-compliance since their inception.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So what's changed? Why has cybersecurity suddenly leapt out of the basement and into the board room?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cybersecurity Impacts Stocks, Mergers and Acquisitions</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two recent incidents have taken cybersecurity into new territory and illuminate the shift in business perception of cybersecurity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In August, the cybersecurity firm MedSec used its knowledge of an undisclosed vulnerability in a medical device toshort sell the stockof its manufacturer, St. Jude Medical. On August 25, 2016, MedSec's investment firmreleased the reporton the attack risks to the medical device, resulting in a five-percent drop in St. Jude's stock. The loss - combined with the revelation of the dangerous device vulnerability - threatened to put the manufacturer's $25 billion sale to Abbott Laboratories in jeopardy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While St. Jude's stock has rebounded, it is still below pre-August 25 levels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similarly, whennews brokeSeptember 23 that (at least) 500 million Yahoo user credentials were stolen in a breach that went undetected since 2014, Yahoo's sale to Verizon Communications came into question. The $4.8 billion cash sale of Yahoo's core business is still in early stages, and Verizon could use the largest hack of a single company as leverage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a&quot;New York Times&quot; interview, Boston College Law School Professor Brian Quinn said Verizon could call off the deal entirely by contending &quot;certain high-level Yahoo employees were aware of the severity of the hack before the deal was agreed upon, and intentionally withheld information,&quot; thus violating the merger agreement. Quinn argues it's more likely, though, that Verizon will use the incident to renegotiate terms more favorable to them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yahoo'salleged secret scanningof customer email data for U.S. intelligence could be another cybersecurity issue used to stir the pot of the merger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regulations Get Teeth--and Executives Don't Want to Get Bitten</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The European Union's General Data Protection Act (GDPR) should be on the minds of everyone doing business in the E.U. The legislation will give citizens more confidence over their personal information and make companies responsible for keeping their data secure. It lays out mandatory and timely data breach reporting, extends the definition of personal data and enshrines the &quot;right to be forgotten&quot; in law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GDPR won't be in effect until May of 2018, but organizations are already scrambling to understand and implement changes that will make them compliant with the new regulations. One reason for this: it's got teeth. GDPR will dramatically increase penalties for non-compliance, with fines of up to \xE2,\xAC20 million (or four percent of turnover) - significantly higher than the \xE2,\xAC750,000 penalty under the current Data Protection Directive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Closer to home, New York State has proposed cybersecurity regulations aimed at guarding consumer data and financial systems from cyberattacks. The regulations would require all banks and insurance companies operating in the state to designate a CISO, adopt written cybersecurity policies and implement annual penetration tests, among other seemingly basic requirements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Notably, under the proposed regulations, board or senior compliance officers would need to certify that their organization's security controls are meeting requirements. This could potentially expose such individuals up to criminal liability if the claim is found fraudulent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Your Have My Attention (and Budgetary Carte Blanche)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Executives and board members pay attention when their jobs, companies and tens of billions of dollars are at stake.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While overall cybersecurity spending is on the rise, certain organizations aren't putting a cap on how far. This year,Bank of Americahas implemented a &quot;whatever it takes&quot; approach to thwarting attacks, giving unlimited budget to its cybersecurity business unit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While there will surely be scrutiny to the effectiveness and ROI of how such (non) budgets are spent, it's obvious that the C-suite has gotten the message. Lax security practices don't just mean embarrassing headlines and lost customer confidence. The consequences have become much more tangible and outlined in terms non-security professionals can understand - usually with a dollar sign in front of it.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Squire Patton Boggs LLP has hired Monika Kuschewsky as a partner in its data privacy and cybersecurity group in Brussels as the law firm anticipates increased demand from clients seeking advice on new EU data protection regulations.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kuschewsky joins from Covington &amp; Burling LLP, where she was special counsel for the last three years. Prior to that, she was partner and head of Van Bael &amp; Bellis's European data protection practice. Kuschewsky has practiced in Brussels since 2000. At Squire Patton Boggs, she will also be a member of the intellectual property and technology practice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her appointment comes as the European Union prepares to put into force the General Data Protection Regulation. GDPR would strengthen and unify the protection of individuals in the EU, and also regulate the export of personal data outside the region. The new rules were adopted&nbsp;this year and are scheduled to come into force in May 2018.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kuschewsky said at Squire Patton Boggs, she wants to combine her experience in Pan-European projects, her local expertise and networks, and the firm's global presence spanning 21 countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The data protection law, not being a European issue but increasingly a global issue, this interconnection of offices is becoming more and more relevant,&quot; Kuschewsky said.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The clients that come to Kuschewsky are broad-based, ranging from media technology, automotive, transportation, and healthcare. Squire Patton Boggs has a strong client base in the automotive and Fintech industries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Key issues that on which clients seek advice include cross-border data transfers, the new GDPR, as well as existing data protection rules, and cybersecurity laws, Kuschewsky said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kuschewsky noted that companies have only just &nbsp;started looking into the implications of GDPR and expects the trend to pick up next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.K.'s vote to exit the EU has also brought up concerns for clients, especially those which have their European headquarters in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In July 2016, the European Commission adopted the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield, which imposes stronger obligations on U.S. companies to protect Europeans' personal data. It was a move that invalidated the Safe Harbor framework, which allowed the transfer of European citizens' data to the US.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now the privacy shield is in place... I don't foresee data protection would be the No.1 priority for [U.S. President-elect] Trump,&quot; Kuschewsky said. &quot;Depending on what he does, there may be an impact. But then, if he wants to create jobs, his interest would also be to allow U.S. companies to continue dealing with European companies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kuschewsky's book,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">Data Protection and Privacy</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, &nbsp;was recently published by Thomson Reuters.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">DEAL SIZE</SPAN><BR></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The European Union's (EU) new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which goes into full effect in May 2018, creates a comprehensive regulatory regime for the way that personal data of EU citizens will be handled by organizations globally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Organizations that may process (i.e. collect, store, or otherwise handle) personal data of EU citizens are scurrying to be compliant with this strict new framework. The stakes are enormous: The GDPR substantially increases penalties for privacy violations to as much as four percent of a company's annual global revenue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">How Did We Get Here?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The roots of the new GDPR can be traced back nearly 40 years, when the French parliament approved the Data Protection and Liberties Act in 1978. This law prohibited the processing of &quot;sensitive&quot; data, which included information related to the health or sexual life of individuals, but also any identifying information related to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion or trade union affiliation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A few years later, the Council of Europe in Strasbourg drew up The Convention for the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data (ETS No. 108) in 1981. The guidelines strengthened data privacy across Europe by creating legal protections for individuals specifically related to how personal data was electronically handled, setting Europe on a pathway toward a unified approach to the regulation of data privacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Strasbourg Data Protection Treaty was ratified in 1985 and was later amended in 1999 to clarify a few details in light of changing technologies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the meantime, the European Commission became concerned that as member states continued to adopt their own data protection laws, divergent data protection legislation could impede the free flow of data within the EU. Accordingly, in 1995, the European Commission adopted Directive 95/46/EC to regulate the processing of personal data throughout the EU. The directive contained seven core principles member states were expected to implement, but the principles were high level and served more as guidelines. As a result, data protection regulation in member states continued to diverge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As time progressed and technologies evolved, these differences in how various nations within the EU implemented the directive began to create increasing confusion regarding how personal data should be treated across borders. This not only became a concern for corporations as the guardians of that data, but also for regulators who were tasked with determining which country's data protection laws should take precedence in any given situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Implications for E-discovery</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Legal observers are hopeful that the GDPR will bring more certainty to the lingering debate: e-discovery versus data privacy-who prevails? There has been a long-standing tension between EU privacy rights and U.S. e-discovery obligations, which the directive and various EU country-specific data privacy laws made even more challenging when faced with collection, processing, review, and production tasks along the e-discovery lifecycle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the short term, it is unclear as to how much certainty will be brought to this lingering debate of &quot;who prevails.&quot; However, we do envision a handful of key implications and issues to consider with respect to the GDPR and the e-discovery process:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Right to be forgotten / data portability rights</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Companies lose custody and control over their own information as custodians can request the deletion of their own data and/or the transfer of their own data to another institution, potentially even during a government investigation or litigation. This brings about conflict between U.S. requirements regarding the preservation of potentially relevant evidence and the EU data subject's right to have data deleted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, a person could exercise his or her right to be forgotten after receiving a preservation notice. Will EU Data Protection Authorities consider, or even ask, whether an individual is under a litigation hold before requiring an organization to delete personal data? If an organization is required to comply with the individual's right to be forgotten, a U.S. judge will likely respond unfavorably and assert a conflicting obligation of the need to preserve potentially relevant information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Privacy impact assessment (PIA) obligation and information needed to complete PIAs</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The information provided in PIAs is essentially an audit trail of data transfers, deletions, etc. for the company. If data were to be inadvertently deleted that was potentially relevant to an ongoing investigation or litigation, this would potentially require a company to produce its PIA or audit trail of how data was handled. A company's compliance with the GDPR's PIA requirements could become a shield in discovery supporting why certain data was removed from systems. On the other hand, if the PIAs were not thorough, the lack of information could become an additional source for sanctions under the new FRCP rules.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DPO requirement</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How, if at all, will this impact eDiscovery, if organizations basically now have to create at least a minimal level of compliance regime around privacy issues? Will debates over privacy compliance versus e-discovery/U.S. litigation compliance become enhanced or lessened?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Answers to these questions remain to be seen. However, one positive outcome of more companies having a DPO within their legal or compliance department could be greater advocacy and education of U.S. judges and regulators regarding these conflicts and the need for resolution that may reasonably meet all parties' objectives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Transfer of personal data to third countries</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Article 48 of the GDPR expressly states that orders or judgments by non-EU courts and administrative authorities requiring transfer or disclosure of personal data are not a valid basis for transferring data to third countries. Instead, Article 48 states that such orders or requests will be recognized only in so far as they are based on international agreements or treaties between the third country and the EU or member state, such as the Hague Convention on the Taking of Evidence Abroad in Civil or Commercial Matters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result, litigants in U.S. courts will either need to rely on an appropriate treaty or find other acceptable bases for transferring and disclosing personal data in litigation, even though none of the existing options is well suited for U.S.-style discovery. Indeed, data controllers who find themselves in U.S. court or subject to a subpoena will continue to face a Catch-22 between complying with their obligations under U.S. law versus the GDPR-only now the stakes are much higher due to the GDPR's higher fines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Sanctions</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This finally puts privacy on the risk level of antitrust, AML or ABC, and may make companies pause before deciding to go forward with discovery (or may result in more &quot;conferring&quot; during the meet and confer about such issues.) Attorneys will need to redouble their efforts during the early stages of litigation to minimize the likelihood of a full-blown conflict between a U.S. court order and the GDPR's requirements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An increasing number of companies may also decide it is worth early settlements or even risking sanctions in U.S. court rather than face fines in the EU, particularly for litigation that is not considered a serious threat to the company or its way of doing business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These issues will increase the strains on U.S. lawyers who not only need to protect their clients' interests in litigation, but also need to comply with ethical guidelines related to the preservation and sharing of evidence and the certification of complete discovery such as FRCP Rule 26(g) certification.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Extraterritorial effect of GDPR</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GDPR regulations provide a broad net for EU regulators to sanction companies. Not only will data stored in the EU fall within the jurisdiction of the GDPR, but also any data created or stored in the U.S. that relates to an EU citizen will be implicated by the GDPR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Therefore, an organization should be cognizant of the services and goods it may provide to individuals with an understanding that it likely will face a heightened regulatory environment. The clash between U.S. discovery laws and EU data privacy laws will not be aided by this extraterritoriality effect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">More obligations on service providers acting as data processors</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These increased obligations under the GDPR bring potentially negative implications against e-discovery service providers and/or law firms who serve as e-discovery service providers if those entities cannot meet the heightened standards. A data processor who demonstrates compliance with the heightened GDPR standards will likely be recognized as a preferred provider within the industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new data protection regulatory regime set to take effect in the EU is a game-changer in the way that data privacy is regulated in the EU. Although the EU has been a leader in data privacy regulations, the GDPR clearly establishes the most comprehensive and strict regulatory framework in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These new rules are comprehensive and are enforced by serious compliance requirements that contain potentially jaw-dropping financial penalties. Organizations and their counsel need take notice now so they can be fully prepared for its implementation in May 2018. One place to start is by rethinking creating new protocols for e-discovery.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CEOs of U.S. businesses have known for some time that cybersecurity is a significant issue affecting their day-to-day operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thanks to several high-profile data breaches and hacker attacks, such as at Sony and Target, the topic of cybersecurity also has become a regular agenda item for many boards of directors of U.S. companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the topic is growing in importance for European business leaders as well.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2018, the European Union is scheduled to introduce the General Data Protection Regulation, which will establish stringent requirements for any businesses that deal with European consumers' data. The new regulations are coming into force on May 25, 2018, for all EU member states - but it affects any company doing business with EU citizens, regardless of where the company is based.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To better understand what European businesses are doing to deal with cybersecurity and how they're preparing for the new regulations, Lloyd's commissioned its &quot;Facing the Cyber Risk Challenge&quot; survey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new research found that 54 percent of CEOs in European companies are taking responsibility for cybersecurity, but the majority seriously underestimates a cyber event's potential impact with a minority of European companies believing that they will lose market share after a cyber attack becomes known.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When asked specifically about the new EU regulations, the survey found some surprising results, despite the serious financial and legal consequences of not complying with the rules:</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than half the businesses surveyed were aware the new EU regulations could affect them in terms of regulatory investigation (64 percent), financial penalties (58 percent), share price (57 percent) and reputation (52 percent), but only 13 percent believed they could lose customers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Too complacent?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When asked whether their company had suffered a data breach in the past five years, 92 percent of respondents (all in Europe) said they had, while 3 percent said they had &quot;come close.&quot; Only 5 percent of respondents said they had not suffered a breach or were unaware that they had. Despite these numbers, only 42 percent are worried about suffering another breach in the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The survey found that most businesses were more concerned about external rather than internal threats. The internal threats that businesses were most worried were low-tech, with 42 percent of respondents stating physical loss of paper documents as a key concern. The same percentage also listed an insider intentionally breaching information as a key threat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The number one external threat is hacking, according to the survey. Half (51 percent) of the businesses questioned said they were worried about the possibility of being hacked for financial gain, compared to 46 percent who were concerned about being hacked for political reasons. Hacking by a competitor, however, was viewed as a serious threat by 41 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inga Beale, CEO of Lloyd's, warned that &quot;Firms may still be too complacent as regards how they are prepared for a cyber risk incident and what the implications of one could be for their business.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Awareness of cyber insurance</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the survey, 73 percent of business leaders have a limited knowledge of cyber insurance, and 50 percent don't know that cyber coverage for data breaches is available.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In commenting on the survey, Beale reminded European businesses that the new EU regulations will mean that they have to be more responsive to any cyber incident than may have been the case in the past. &quot;Insurance companies provide more than just cover for any lost income,&quot; she added. &quot;They offer a wrap-around service that can keep businesses on the right side of regulation and help protect their customers and their reputation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The survey questioned 346 senior decision-makers at large companies (with revenues of #x20AC;250 million or more) across Europe. Respondents' job titles included chief executive officer, chief financial officer, chief operating officer, chief onformation officer, chief technology officer, chief risk officer and general counsel.</SPAN></P>

Thanks to several high-profile data breaches and hacker attacks, such as Sony and Target, the topic of cyber security also has become a regular agenda item for many boards of directors of U.S. companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the topic is growing in importance for European business leaders as well. In 2018 the European Union (EU) is scheduled to introduce the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which will establish stringent requirements for any businesses that deal with European consumers' data.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After months of bureaucratic debate between the EU and US, policymakers have finally reached an agreement on Privacy Shield, a&nbsp;transatlantic data transfer pact.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is an important achievement for the privacy rights of citizens across Europe,&quot; said John Frank, vice president of EU government affairs for Microsoft, on the company's blog. &quot;Privacy Shield shows that there is more that unites the US and Europe on data protection than a superficial comparison might suggest. On both sides of the Atlantic, people and policymakers believe in strong privacy protection.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But now that an agreement has been reached, what are next steps for companies on either side of the Atlantic? How does the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) factor in? And will Brexit present further issues to navigate?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) that will go into effect in 2018 has replaced the Privacy Directive, and has left many businesses - particularly law firms - scrambling to understand the new compliance environment. At the Women, Influence, Power in Law conference in Washington,&quot;D.C. from Sept. 21-23, a panel titled &quot;Developments and Uncertainty in International Data Protection &amp; Compliance&quot; will address some of the implications for companies in the U.S. and around the world in regards to the GDPR.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speakers on the panel include Anjli Garg, director of associate general counsel of Citibank, Mary J. Hildebrand, founder and chair, privacy and information security practice and partner for The Tech Group of Lowenstein Sandler, and Karen M. Sheehan, vice president and deputy general counsel for Tupperware Brands Corporation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garg told the WIPL Network that one of the biggest challenges regarding the new legislation is to &quot;ensure that the right infrastructure is in place to comply with the GDPR.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GDPR expands the rights of individuals with respect to their personal data, such as the right to data portability, and the right to be forgotten, but this means that &quot;U.S. businesses that transact with EU residents must have a nimble enough technical infrastructure to track personal data, transfer it, erase it and/or stop using it upon an individual's request,&quot; Garg said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The panel session will bring GCs together to compare notes on how to ensure compliance with GDPR and avoid penalties. Some of the topics of discussion will include what companies should do now in light of the new legislation; what types of cascade effects there will be on operations and businesses; the impact of the privacy shield; and further discussion on what Brexit means for the GDPR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garg pointed out that the GDPR supersedes the EU Data Protection Directive and creates a uniform standard for data protection in the EU, expanding the jurisdictional reach of EU data protection laws, and allowing for hefty fines for certain GDPR violations. She noted:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So even if your company has no presence in the EU, so long as you market to EU residents, for example through the web, you may need to comply with the GDPR. Failure to do so could result in fines of up to 4 percent of your annual worldwide turnover.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What this practically means is that each business must take a close look and determine whether it needs to comply with the GDPR and, if it does, it should devise and implement a plan to come into compliance before May 25, 2018.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As compliance is the main challenge for businesses regarding this new legislation, it's key to become aware of the pitfalls potentially in place, one of which may be the provisions regarding data breach notification in the GDPR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The U.S., at the federal and state level, already has data breach notification laws, so U.S. businesses have experience in this space. Having said that, they still need to examine the GDPR breach notification requirements and incorporate them into their relevant breach notification plans,&quot; Garg said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At its annual legal conference, Lockheed Martin recently recognized global law firm K&amp;L Gates for its commitment to inclusion and diversity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The global security company performed an assessment of the law firm - in addition to other outside legal teams it works with - and considered qualifiers such as the percentage of minority and female timekeepers working on Lockheed Martin projects.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">K&amp;L Gates' Valerie Jackson, senior advisor to the management committee and firm-wide director of diversity and inclusion, told Inside Counsel that &quot;harnessing the value created by diversity in our client teams and leadership ranks keeps us close to our markets and drives innovation among our lawyers and staff,&quot; among other benefits of maintaining diversity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the first year that Lockheed Martin has recognized a law firm for excellence in diversity and inclusion, but K&amp;L Gates is no stranger to excelling in these areas. In addition to the firm's inclusion on Yale Law Women's list of the Top 10 Family Friendly Firms of 2016, K&amp;L Gates also was named the Outstanding Firm for Furthering Women's Advancement (Recruitment, Retention and Promotion) in the 2015 Chambers Women in Law Awards, USA, and has been recognized as a &quot;Top 100 Law Firm for Diversity&quot; and a &quot;Top 100 Law Firm for Women&quot; by MultiCultural Law magazine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jackson said part of the impetus behind working towards these high standards of diversity is the evidence that diverse teams create more successful companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As a client-focused professional services firm, we want the best and brightest of all backgrounds, with their varied perspectives and experiences, to work with us for the benefit of our firm and our clients,&quot; she said. But, she added, &quot;A diverse workforce is not a panacea.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company needs to foster an environment that makes for an inclusive workplace culture that &quot;welcomes talent from all backgrounds and provides a home where they want to stay and can thrive,&quot; she explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jackson also noted that an inclusive culture allows the whole staff to feel comfortable &quot;bringing their full selves to work, thus allowing them to do more and give more&quot; - an imperative for the firm's success.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the ways in which the firm builds its diverse team - and keeps it - is by focusing on recruitment and professional development efforts including diversifying promotion classes at all levels, and diversifying leadership ranks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jackson said: &quot;For example, in two years, we more than doubled the number of women on the firm's management committee, and this year over 54 percent of lawyers internally promoted to partner were women.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">K&amp;L Gates has a broader strategy because of its international footprint, and focuses on two dimensions of diversity: inherent diversity such as age or ethnicity, and acquired diversity - characteristics that we attain through formative experiences such as military service, living in multiple countries, etc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jackson said that, most importantly, the proof is in the pudding: &quot;The awards and recognitions we receive are objective measures of progress, but the true measure will be how our firm continues to grow and thrive as an inclusive, people-centered, client-focused business, all around the world.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two of the most insidious myths about cybersecurity are that most threats originate outside an organization - Russian hackers, for example - and that it is an IT problem. Amie Taal, a cybersecurity expert with Deutsche Bank, Jenny Le, who runs operations for e-discovery provider FRONTEO, and James A. Sherer, chair of BakerHostetler's information governance practice, are determined to dispel those myths. Below, they discuss their recent white paper focused on insider threats and the cyber responsibilities of C-suite executives (&quot;Increased C-Suite Recognition of Insider Threats Through Modern Technological and Strategic Mechanisms&quot;). Their remarks have been edited for length and style.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MCC: There was a day when corporate executives could walk the factory floor to keep an eye out for people and process problems. In today's knowledge economy, executives have limited visibility into employees' day-to-day processes and tools. At the same time, government regulators and others are putting insider cybersecurity threats squarely on their radar. That seems like an impossible situation. How should C-suite executives deal with it?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sherer: Let's start with the metaphor of the factory floor. What can we do to recreate that kind of environment when we're not manufacturing something tangible? What can we do to walk a virtual factory floor? How can you use big-data collection and analytics to tell you when something's going awry or to recognize that things are going positively? Does it mean that we set up our metrics wrong in the first place? Does it mean that something bad is happening that's otherwise hidden? Or does it mean we should speak to the rest of the organization about something that's going right and what we learn from it? And how can we use new technologies to improve our overall processes?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taal: One of the biggest issues is responsibility. Until 2011, most stakeholders in an organization believed anything to do with hacking, attacks or insider threats was an IT responsibility. It wasn't something the C-suite needed to get involved in. A large U.S. survey in 2011 asked who has responsibility, and 80 percent said it was IT, with only 43 percent saying the C-suite has some responsibility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fast-forward to 2016. Things have changed. The wake-up call was in 2015, when the FCC fined AT&amp;T $25 million over an incident in a number of their call centers in which three employees stole and sold 83,000 customer records. In addition to the fines, AT&amp;T had to appoint a senior compliance manager, contact all customers that were affected, put controls in place, implement an information security program, and train employees on privacy policies. These measures to protect their customers' private data and file regular compliance reports with the FCC governance and controls should have been in place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am seeing a difference now. C-suite executives are engaging with stakeholders to protect the organization not just from insider threats but also from other attacks. Regulators in the U.S. and EU have issued guidance and disclosure obligations. You have the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) coming into effect in 2018, under which fines could reach 4 percent of an organization's gross income. That's for breaches of EU citizens' PII (personally identifiable information) data, not small change for any organization. We are going to see a lot more interest and involvement from the C-suite.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Le: It's both an awareness and interest issue, and a growing accountability issue as well. The Global State of Information Security Survey measures how involved the C-suite is in these issues. Results from 2015 showed that only 38 percent of CEOs promoted cybersecurity as a corporate governance imperative and not simply an IT issue. An even lesser percentage understood the organization's information security technologies. A C-suite's focus on bringing together teams, sharing information and promoting proper communication is key to tackling these challenges. We're only going to see this focus increase with the growing regulatory pressures and responsibilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MCC: As the pressure and responsibility ratchets up, executives have to balance their usual business responsibilities with their special cybersecurity and insider threat responsibilities. Your white paper suggests that those roles can be in conflict. Explain this tension and how executives can deal with it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taal: There's definitely a conflict. When you look at the impact of the insider threat, it affects the bottom line and an organization's reputation. That's where the interest lies. Executives are making it a priority and trying to balance that with all of their other responsibilities. The difference is that it's no longer just an IT responsibility, nor is it a C-suite responsibility alone. The responsibility lies with all stakeholders within an organization, with the C-suite having visibility into what's being done to protect the organization, rather than another responsibility they're taking on. It's about getting the buy-in from the C-suite and all other stakeholders in a collaborative effort to support the C-suite.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Le: The more interest the C-suite has, the more commitment you're going to get from other groups. That promotes communication and a collaborative environment. Putting together a program to address insider threats, or cybersecurity generally, requires diverse groups within an organization to come together and focus on a common goal. That's difficult. Sometimes that means not only learning new tools and technologies but also considering new applications for existing tools. That's difficult because it is not their traditional focus. Commitment from the C-suite is going to make a huge difference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sherer: The threat profile is high enough that C-level executives understand it is important on its own, and it can be important to their careers. That's incentivizing more active effort. Executives are no longer saying, &quot;I don't need to know about it because it's highly technical.&quot; Instead, they're saying, &quot;This is very important to our business.&quot; There may be a better appreciation that it's time to get trained, to understand the basics, and to say, &quot;I get this. This is important to the organization. I'm going to lead. I've got the right people to whom I can delegate this as an important strategic matter, rather than just reacting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taal: Executives don't really need to know the nitty-gritty about how things are done on a day-to-day basis. They need to understand the impact. People still believe that cyberhacking is about outsiders rather than insiders, but 80 percent of incidences are carried out by insiders during work hours. There's a trust element within the organization where executives are simply hoping things don't happen. Things do happen, so education and training are paramount.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MCC: The technologies available to workers to increase productivity can surface data that drives better corporate decision-making. But those benefits carry some real legal and business risks. Give us some sense of what that environment feels like for the C-suite executive. How do they strike an appropriate balance?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sherer: There's some very good marketing that frames big data as the solution to every problem. It's pretty close to magic, especially when the marketing incorporates brand-new words and spoon-feeds the solutions to the audience. Like anything else, it can be very difficult to parse exactly how data analytics work and what they offer. Understanding what you're ultimately seeing and how that's derived are both very important. Users should also consider that big data analytics carry some risks and related questions. How great is your data? Are there problems that could lead to fundamental misapprehensions? How good is your data governance?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Users are creating new sets of important and sensitive information that can improve decision-making but also present their own challenges. How do users manage and protect data sets? The process may create a set of information defined as &quot;the crown jewels.&quot; That's one more thing to protect. How do you use that data in ways that aren't going to infringe on civil liberties or cause undue influences? Much of it is issue-spotting and asking why. Users are looking for a level of comfort to say, &quot;We've done our due diligence. We can use this appropriately. We can protect it now that we know what it is, what it comprises, what it means to us, and what it would mean if we lost control of it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Le: The challenge is understanding what you're looking at and making sure that the reporting you generate based on these data sets answers the questions you're asking. The use of artificial intelligence and advanced analytics can quickly make sense of large data sets, but misapplying the technology can create more work than if you hadn't used it. That data can end up leading you down a rabbit hole. It's important to understand the technology you're using and to make sure you have the support to properly read that data. We offer a host of technology solutions for big data management and analysis, but our focus is on helping our clients understand what tools to use when, and how to use those tools most effectively. We have helped many of our clients implement processes using artificial intelligence tools to be able to detect and report cartel activity so as to satisfy the leniency application requirements at the Department of Justice. In those projects, we are not just implementing technology but also working with several internal teams (IT, compliance, legal, etc.) to help ensure everyone understands how to use and interpret the data that is both captured and generated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taal: In addition to the technology, you also need what we call a &quot;behavioral analytics plan&quot; to know how you're going to find what you're looking for and how you can support what you're looking to do, since you have employees who are going to use the technology on a day-to-day basis. How do you store that data? How do you protect it? Can you use that data for the particular thing you're using it for, especially if it was acquired for something else? There's a lot to consider. You have the technology, you have the data, and it can be used to get some answers and results as long as it's reliable, you support it, and you have a plan and controls in place to work with the data for the purpose at hand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MCC: Awareness of insider threats seems to be growing, but we're not really there yet. Most of what we read is about outside threats such as Russian and Chinese hackers, but most studies show that more threats come from the inside. And they're not all of one piece. How does the nature of the insider threat impact an organization's planning and response?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sherer: Let's start with the people whom perhaps you're not thinking of. It's easy to conjure up visions of malicious insiders - someone in your organization trying to send data to a foreign power or sell it to your competitors. They're certainly a threat that needs to be dealt with in a strong fashion, but that malicious insider is the exception to the rule. Most people aren't intentionally trying to take down the company from within. But what we do have are people who are dealing with a flood of information and the advent of new technologies, and they sometimes simply don't know how things work. These gaps in understanding can lead to gaps in process, which lead to potential vulnerabilities. These people may inadvertently do something that exposes data, or an outsider may exploit the processes or the people. The BYOD (bring your own device) movement is a good example of this challenge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taal: In any organization, you have the intentional and the unintentional. The majority of acts are unintentional. Part of it is a lack of training. Part of it is a lack of ownership and taking responsibility as a stakeholder in an organization. You also have contractors, third-party service providers, even ex-employees with continuing access because accounts and passwords haven't been closed down and controls are not in place. We also need to worry about social media. Organizations are putting controls in place because they see employees going on Facebook or Twitter and writing things that should only be privy within the organization. Those are the unintentional ones. You also have individuals who are disgruntled, and they just want to cause a denial of service, bring the system down, or cause havoc by installing malicious software. And there are people who abuse their permissions, accessing unauthorized areas. You have to look into all of that and make sure that whatever you put in place, you're being mindful of intentional and unintentional acts. It goes back to responsibility. Whose responsibility is it? Who should be involved in protecting the organization with regards to these types of insider threats?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MCC: How important is it for organizations to understand where they stand regarding the various benchmarking standards? Which are most helpful?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sherer: When we're benchmarking with clients, we look at a number of different avenues. It's not so much the ISO standards (published by the International Organization for Standardization and the International Electrotechnical Commission), though they can certainly come into play. We're providing clients with a sound method they can use to spot issues in their environment. We benchmark against prior organizational experience as well as industry-specific experience. One of the nice things about this area of practice is that companies are in it together. They are not fighting each other. They're establishing industry norms and learning from each other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Le: Our company is certainly held to the highest security standards, since we're housing data and working with sensitive client data every day. We are both ISO27001 and PCI DSS certified. In fact, many of the requirements and cross-checks that go into these certifications can also be useful for organizations that aren't required to be certified. The challenge is communicating with all employees in an organization, and especially with those people to whom it matters most. When we talk about unintentional disclosures of data or insider threats from employees, that's where the issue is. Internal policies or benchmarking standards are only as good as your people's understanding of where the risks are and what the proper practices are.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taal: It's all about training. You can have processes and policies in place until the cows come home, but if it's not communicated properly, if it's not updated properly, if people are not trained properly to understand the policies, procedures, and processes, and if there's no monitoring process to assure compliance with the policies, they don't really work. Insider threat programs should be separate from IT security programs. Most organizations still have intentional and unintentional insider threat plans lumped together under IT security. The guidance, in addition to ISO and all of these benchmarks, is to have a standalone insider threat plan and to educate the C-suite and others on that plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MCC: This is an area that has many executives dreaming of magic bullets. There must be some technical solution, some process, some psychological insights being developed that can really help here. Looking into the future, what do you see as the most promising approach to the insider cyberthreats companies are facing?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taal: There's never going to be a one-size-fits-all solution. There are a number of things, some of which we've touched on. Organizations have to have a separate insider threat plan and be very aggressive with that and gain C-suite endorsement. Most organizations focus so much on the technical behavior of employees that they neglect nontechnical behaviors such as employees working overtime, never taking a vacation, or asking questions about things they're not authorized to know. It's always good to have a focus on both technical and nontechnical behaviors. Other things include: using behavioral analytics tools to help identify psychosocial events that may be warning indicators; a partnership with all of the stakeholders (IT, HR, legal, compliance, even physical security, and definitely leadership by the C-suite); an incident management plan for insider threats so you can study the attacks and learn from them; and, last and most important, you need training from the top down and bottom up on insider threats - what they mean, what the impact can be, how they can be prevented. If an organization does these things, life should be easier. But the insider threat is here to stay and is not going away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Le: You have to understand your organization before you can address the issues and what kind of plan or process you should put in place. That can be a challenge. What kinds of technologies are your employees using? Where are the risks? An organization looking within itself to understand the existing technology being used, as well as what employees may be using that may not be officially sanctioned, can begin to consider how to mitigate potential risks; that's a step forward. This is going to require collaboration across teams. Some of the technologies we offer are now being used to mitigate risks by organizations that have already been reprimanded by the DOJ. That's what's driving a lot of our clients toward these kinds of programs. Of course, organizations that have not yet gotten in trouble but understand there is an incentive to having technologies and processes in place are going to be one step ahead. That said, many other incentives should drive organizations and especially the C-suite to take these issues seriously and make time to understand what other organizations are doing. Even in the absence of regulatory investigations, accidental loss or mishandling of confidential or private information can be detrimental to an organization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sherer: Technology is great and can help in a lot of ways. But things change so quickly that it's difficult to imagine one approach that solves everything and could do so in a static fashion. And despite the marketing we've seen, I'm still not aware of any company that purports to do that. Instead, it's about understanding what your organization is doing, and that's a dynamic process. You can only get a snapshot, and then it changes - things move that quickly. You need to understand your environment and also pay close attention to what's happening outside of it. That's very helpful for benchmarking and best practices. What challenges exist, and how are other organizations dealing with them?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other thing I try to advocate is the creation of processes where compliance is &quot;built-in&quot; but employees or users are allowed to &quot;opt-out.&quot; Process can make it difficult for people to be out of compliance. Look at email, for example. Process can direct employees to save email for only a certain amount of time, so that they only get a certain volume, with exceptions for special situations such as legal holds. It curbs employee behavior. Then the same complacency that allows people to save everything and never delete it instead leads employees to work within the system and manage their email accordingly. This active consideration of how things work directs behavior in positive ways and avoids letting these processes or new technologies evolve organically to a point where an unthinking status quo can lead to bad behaviors that present additional challenges further down the line.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although vendor-written, this contributed piece does not advocate a position that is particular to the author's employer and has been edited and approved by Network World editors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the world of compliance and governance, terms such as certified, compliant and validated have distinct meanings that are often mistakenly used interchangeably.&nbsp; It is key to understand the terms themselves and how they are used in the industry, so here's a handy guide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before we dive into the specific types of credentials, it is important to understand that there are two fundamental processes that take place during an initial audit - attestation and assurance -- that determine the extent to which the audit criteria are fulfilled. Conducting these procedures helps businesses meet third-party risk and compliance requirements and provides information to customers and other stakeholders that validates the integrity of an organization's control environment.&nbsp; To put it in simple terms, think of it like a letter of recommendation or evidence showing that something is true:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Attestation.&nbsp; This is when an auditor has validated or verified that your claims are true to the extent that they will put their organization's reputation on the line by signing an attestation. In doing this validation they have directly reviewed processes, examined product code, and dug into the evidence of the attestations requirements to the best of their ability.&nbsp; For instance, audits such as ISO-27001, SOC-2 and FIPS are considered attestations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Assurance. This is when an auditor has reviewed a company's process or product based on evidence provided by the company to the auditor. While this may seem similar to an attestation on the surface, it is not. It's as if an auditor were to say, &quot;To the best of our ability and based on the evidence provided by the company, we can assure they are following the proper guidelines.&quot; A good example would be HIPAA or ISAE-3000 - both of which are referred to as Type II assurances. The term &quot;Type II&quot; refers to the length of the audit process-for example, HIPAA and ISAE-3000 were reviewed by auditors over a 6-month period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now that we've covered some of the basics, let's explore the differences between common compliance terms:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Compliant.&nbsp; In order to be compliant with regulations, an organization must align their process and controls with the requirements of the regulation. My company Druva, for instance, is HIPAA compliant based on a 6-month assurance audit conducted by KPMG where we provided evidence and the auditor concluded that our process and controls comply with HIPAA's guidelines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another way that organizations can enable compliance is to conduct their own assessment of their process and controls, and align them with the requirements and intent of the regulation. Take compliance for ITAR, for example.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Certified. Based on attestations, certifications have an official process in place, which requires a governing body to audit a company's process, controls and products before they can officially receive a certificate and be 'certified'. Safe Harbor (when it existed) had its own official certification process, for instance. But not all regulations have a certification process. HIPAA is one example where organizations can only be HIPAA compliant, not HIPAA certified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Validated.&nbsp; In addition to complying with requirements, some regulations go a step further and require validation for authenticity of certified components. FIPS 140-2 certification is one such regulation that requires validation for certified encryption modules. In basic English, that means the code inside the encryption modules or libraries has been reviewed and certified by the U.S. government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When an organization acquires these modules for usage in their product, they are pre-compiled, meaning the encryption code cannot be altered because they come with an identifying fingerprint that ensures the integrity of the module. Once these modules are integrated into the product, an outside third-party that is recognized for auditing FIPS modules conducts an audit of the implementation and validates the authenticity via the fingerprint. After passing the audit, the third-party entity will write a letter of attestation and sign it stating that the company's FIPS implementation complies with the FIPS encryption standard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Understanding these common terms can better prepare you to address the growing complexity of compliance regulations as they pertain to your organization and industry. In addition, it can act as a guide for implementing the best technology solutions to help you manage compliance and protect your organization as a whole. Keep in mind that compliance terms can vary by country and context, such as with the recent GDPR legislation, so it is important to understand the regulatory compliance requirements of each country you operate within.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If your business markets to customers in the European Union (EU) or provides services that track the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">online activities</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of Europeans (for example, their shopping habits or which videos they click on), beginning in 2018, you will face the challenge of complying with a complex set of laws and rules forming the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This is the case even if you do not have an office or operations in the EU and marks a significant change from current law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like the EU Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC (the &quot;Directive&quot;), which forms the basis of current EU data protection law, the GDPR will regulate the security and privacy of EU residents' personal data. Given the significant technological changes and advances since the Directive was passed 20 years ago, the GDPR is intended to modernize data protection law in the EU and standardize it across the 28 EU member states.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First, we should mention the upsides to the GDPR. The GDPR will introduce greater harmonization across the EU and a single legal framework that applies across the EU member states without varying national laws, as is the case currently. In addition, it should become easier for large multi-national businesses to cover intra-company </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c7">data transfers</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here are the highlights of the some key changes that all companies should be thinking about and planning for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Expanded territorial scope</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First, as mentioned above, many non-EU businesses that are currently not required to comply with EU data protection law will be required to do so once the GDPR takes effect. This is because the GDPR drastically extends the application of European data protection law to data processing that occurs, not only in the EU, but also in the United States and other countries if a company collects, stores or processes personal data related to offering goods or services to EU residents or monitoring Europeans' behavior.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result, if your business markets to EU residents or provides services that monitor the activities of EU residents, your company likely will need to comply with the GDPR, even if you have no European operations and are not required to comply with current EU data protection law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, service providers located in the EU will be directly liable under the GDPR, whereas currently they need only be contractually responsible under their client agreements for how they treat clients' personal data. In today's highly connected marketplace, where more and more businesses are engaging with customers and partners across the globe, many companies will now fall within the scope of the GDPR's jurisdiction and will need to comply with the GDPR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Increased regulatory enforcement and fines</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the GDPR, enforcement of violations is expected to increase. In addition, the GDPR will replace the current framework of varying penalties across EU member states with more severe penalties, with maximum fines of #x20AC;20 million or 4 percent of worldwide revenues, whichever is greater.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Data breach notification requirements</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When in effect, the GDPR will require companies to notify regulators within 72 hours of learning about a personal data breach, regardless of whether the breach is likely to cause harm to affected individuals. The notification must describe the nature of the personal data breach, the categories and approximate number of data subjects implicated, the contact information of the organization's data protection officer, the likely consequences of the breach, and the measures the controller has taken or proposes to take to address and mitigate the breach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Companies also will need to notify affected individuals when a breach is likely to result in a high risk to &quot;the rights and freedoms of individuals&quot; and must notify data subjects of the breach &quot;without undue delay.&quot; Additionally, service providers are required to notify the data owner/controller of a data breach &quot;without undue delay.&quot; The GDPR includes content requirements for notifications and sets forth limited exceptions to the notification rules.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c7">Data protection officers</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All organizations subject to the GDPR will have to implement comprehensive data protection compliance programs and maintain records documenting their data processing practices. Also, companies must appoint a data protection officer (DPO) where (1) they are a public authority or body; (2) their core activities require regular and systematic monitoring of individuals on a large scale; or (3) their core business activities include processing certain types of data on a large scale, including data relating to criminal convictions and offenses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If your organization may be subject to the GDPR, now is the time to start reviewing your existing data privacy and security policies and procedures, including requirements your company expects from its service providers and partners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GDPR will stand as one of the most comprehensive and stringent legal frameworks regulating the collection and treatment of personal data. Once in effect, many companies not currently subject to EU data protection law will find themselves within the ambit of the GDPR and its complex and extensive requirements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meeting the obligations imposed by the GDPR requires thoughtful planning. Companies should take the time now to identify whether they will be subject to the GDPR, and, if they are, how they will need to expand and update their data policies, data breach response plans, business processes and contracts with customers, vendors and business partners.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">European Union regulators recently passed new rules for shielding data from cyber criminals. Every company that operates in or does business with EU citizens must comply, which is virtually every mid-to-large sized company in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Known as theGeneral Data Protection Regulation,or GDPR, this package of new laws gives greater control to consumers, requires faster notification in the event of a breach, and greatly increases fines for violations. Companies are also required to name &quot;data protection officers&quot; who are responsible for checking compliance and advising on changes.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GDPR requirements aren't due to become effective until 2018, but it's never too soon to start preparing for these regulations, because changes will take time. Getting smarter about data encryption is the place to start.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why encryption and not better network safeguards? The majority of cyber criminals are after the sensitive data itself, and the traditional network perimeter is disappearing in the age of IoT and the cloud. Defining the right perimeter to defend has become all but impossible in the current era.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's impossible to build sturdy walls around data - a better approach is to add locks to the data, ensuring only those with the right keys can access an enterprise's sensitive information. A data-centric approach to security that encrypts the data throughout its lifecycle is critical to keeping this information secure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, the GDPR also has expanded the definition of sensitive information. Under the new rules, everything from people's location to their genetic markers are now deemed personally identifiable information (PII). Name and account numbers are just the tip of the iceberg, which makes sense when considering the rising influence of Big Data and analytics tools; the more data there is to analyze, the more data there is to protect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result,IDCpegs the total GDPR related security software spending in Europe will reach $811 million in 2016, $1,335 million in 2017, and $1,713 million in 2018.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A good chunk of that spend could go to beefing up existing encryption and key management techniques.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consider disk encryption. Many hardware devices are now protected with a style of encryption that turns the contents of a drive into unreadable data by default. Only when a password is given is the real information revealed. Databases are encased similarly, unlocked only by cryptographic keys that act as algorithmic counterparts to the encoding software.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This can be an excellent approach for safeguarding information that is permanently archived, as long as, keys are managed and protected in an infrastructure-level secure key manager.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For information needed for real-time decisions that can affect retention, profit, and cash flow, the act of decrypting data wholesale -- even for a few seconds -- can make it vulnerable to a breach. Therefore, approaches such as stateless tokenization and Format-preserving Encryption (FPE) provide data security at the data-level without breaking existing business processes or impeding business analytics and decisions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How does this work? FPE securely de-identifies and encrypts the sensitive data without changing the format.&nbsp; This means with stateless tokenization and FPE technologies, organizations can perform complex analytics on sensitive Personally identifiable information (PII) while addressing the GDPR guidelines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As an example, imagine a company that wants to run analytics on an encrypted customer database with a number of sensitive fields while keeping the data secure and anonymous. By using FPE to de-identify names and account numbers, while keeping visible location data, average spend, and other key metrics, the company can provide insights to partners without compromising sensitive customer data. &nbsp;Also, since there is not the need to decrypt, there's no new vulnerability for an attacker to exploit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Never in the history of computing has data been more widely available or more valuable. The GDPR recognizes this truth and creates new requirements for EU companies to safeguard sensitive information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in a global economy, everyone has a responsibility of protecting data. As such, many organizations will be required to enact some or all of the GDPR requirements before they become active in 2018. Don't wait. The sooner a strategy for complying with the GDPR is in place, the more customers will trust you with their data.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. technology businesses like Alphabet and Facebook toil to make the real world as borderless and global as the digital worlds they create. The physical version just got a lot messier in Europe, the second-largest market for these giant companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Britain voted on Thursday to leave the European Union, fracturing what was slowly becoming a single digital market into potentially two - or possibly more - jurisdictions for technology issues ranging from data privacy, competition, tax and recruiting.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After the vote in the U.K., we are obviously entering a moment of some uncertainty and concern,&quot; Facebook public policy executive Joel Kaplan said at the Computer and Communications Industry Association's Transatlantic Internet Policy Reception in Washington on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Exhibit one in the new European reality for U.S. tech giants is data privacy, an area where Facebook has sparred with regulators. These companies worked hard to get a single set of rules for data protection and privacy across the region. After the U.K. leaves, the country will likely have to create its own set of privacy regulations, potentially driving up compliance costs associated with moving consumer information across borders and complicating the operation of data centers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That could influence consumer data collection used in advertising on Alphabet's Google search engine and Facebook's social media pages, the shipment of a book ordered from a retailer on Amazon.com Inc.'s site in Germany to a shopper in the U.K., or the management of data centers that power Microsoft's cloud computing services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Take the EU's new General Data Protection Regulation, a sweeping legal framework set to take effect in May 2018. When the U.K. leaves, GDPR will no longer apply to the country. Experts expect the U.K. to adopt similar rules, though a separate set of rules - no matter how similar - will cause headaches for U.S. tech companies seeking simplicity as they operate across Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They want one law, one framework, one consistent approach,&quot; said Eduardo Ustaran, a London-based lawyer  specializing in privacy law. &quot;The lack of harmonization makes more cost than regulation itself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ustaran said he's been trying to calm business clients. &quot;There is very much a sense of panic or at least concern,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the U.K. wants to take part in the free flow of data across Europe after leaving the Union, it will have to adopt data-protection standards that the EU deems &quot;adequate&quot; in meeting the same standards as GDPR. The U.K. Information Commissioner's Office, which oversees the country's data processing, said Friday that &quot;international consistency around data protection laws and rights is crucial, both to businesses and  organizations, and to consumers and citizens.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unless the U.K. harmonizes with the new EU rules, U.S. companies will lose the ability to process European consumer data in the U.K., said Jane Finlayson-Brown, a partner at the law firm Allen &amp; Overy in London. This could impact companies that want to use data centers in the U.K. - even as backups if their data centers in other EU countries go down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cloud-computing businesses, such as Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure, are particularly vulnerable to the complications of a split regulatory region. Cloud companies function more efficiently when they can easily shift loads from one data center to another. Restricting the types of data that can be stored in specific locations hampers that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of companies are saying, 'Help. We don't know what to do. We're completely dependent on free flow of data,' &quot; said Todd Ruback, chief privacy officer at Ghostery, which helps companies navigate privacy laws.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The impact of the United Kingdom vote to withdraw from the European Union could have far-reaching consequences for international companies, which may need to rethink their data management policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As a part of the European Union, there is a general directive that all nations abide by a guide,&quot; says Geeman Yip, CEO of cloud consultancy BitTitan. &quot;Now that the UK is not a part of the EU, the previous baseline directives that were adopted will change.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Said another way: When the UK is part of the EU it has the same data sovereignty laws as other countries in the EU. When the UK breaks away, those laws could change. Companies operating in Europe may have to manage one set of data privacy laws for the UK and another for EU-member countries. The issue will impact both cloud and managed service providers who may need to offer additional options for customers to host data across Europe, and enterprise end users who may need to reconsider where their data is stored in Europe.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's all too early to tell exactly what the impact will be, but experts encourage enterprises that operate across Europe to monitor the situation closely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Safe Harbor issues resurface </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another issue dates back to last year when the European Court of Justice sent shock waves across the world by ruling that the US-EU Safe Harbor Agreement was invalid. In response to that, the EU created the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which is expected to be the common standard across the EU for data privacy laws. Now that the UK is exiting the EU, it's unclear if the country will adopt GDPR standards as well, or have its own. &quot;I anticipate (the UK will) structure their privacy and regulatory laws in a fashion similar to the EU,&quot; Yip says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UK's central role in U.S. companies' international operations makes this an important issue. Many large U.S. cloud technology vendors have data centers in the UK that act as hubs for Europe, says Dana Simberkoff, compliance and risk officer at SaaS consultancy AvePoint. Depending on how the GDPR rules shake out, it could push companies to expand their data footprint into other EU-member countries. &quot;From a business perspective, Brexit may impact the development of new data centers in the U.K. as cloud providers may choose to pause those plans until the U.K. plans are made clear,&quot; Simberkoff wrote in an email.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brexit may impact the development of new data centers in the U.K. as cloud providers may choose to pause those plans until the U.K. plans are made clear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dana Simberkoff, compliance and risk officer at SaaS consultancy AvePoint</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Doug Loewe, the vice president of international sales for Interxion, a company that offers data center and collocation space across Europe, says expanding beyond the UK and into Europe isn't necessarily a bad thing for companies with international footprints. &quot;Brexit has put a bright spotlight on the need to look at where your data sits, both for data privacy and performance,&quot; noting that having data situated closer to end users decreases latency.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Global expansion and the distributed nature of a company's information add new complexity to the effective management of a company's information assets and its ability to meet regulatory requirements in a global network. The so called big data problem is not new. What is new is that where this big data lives is no longer an easy question as you embark on global discovery and that regulatory efforts require you to amass information from custodians and information stores around the globe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an effort to contain costs and increase accessibility to critical company data, outsourcing, managed services and cloud storage are commonplace for everything from email to customer relations management and document creation systems. While these tools can manage a company's information assets in a cost-effective manner, the distributed relationships pose a particular legal challenge for those trying to gather all that information for a litigation or investigation. Knowing exactly where certain data is being stored may be the key to whether it can be collected, govern how it is collected and the circumstances under which it can be transferred. This is of particular importance in the EU, where you could inadvertently run afoul of privacy regulations.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EU Regulations</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 1995 European Union Data Protection Directive regulates how and when personal data may be collected, the requirements around the processing of personal data, and the safeguards that must be in place to afford that personal data has &quot;adequate protection.&quot; The directive requires that if personal data is to be transferred, the receiving country must afford an adequate level of protection to that data. EU countries, and some enumerated others, are deemed to afford adequate protection to personal data, but other countries, such as the United States and China, are specifically deemed to not afford adequate protection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) was recently approved by the European Commission, Parliament and Council, and it will replace the Directive as the governing regulation for privacy protection. With its more expansive reach and stringent penalties for violations, the GDPR will have even more impact on the ways global companies do business in the EU. Violators can be fined up to 4 percent of global revenue for violating the GDPR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Invalidation of Safe Harbor</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the past, many U.S. companies doing business in the EU that needed to move employees' personal data around the globe relied on self-certification, pursuant to the U.S. Department of Commerce's Safe Harbor framework. The self-certification was an acknowledgement by the company that adequate levels of protection would be afforded to all personal data of EU citizens that was onward transferred to the U.S. Two other vehicles that could be used to demonstrate adequate protection were binding corporate rules (BCRs) and model contract clauses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The landscape changed in 2015 when the European Court of Justice (ECJ) invalidated the Safe Harbor framework as inadequate to afford personal data the level of protection required by the directive. In the Schrems decision (Schrems v. Data Protection Commissioner [Case C-362/14]), the ECJ declared that the Safe Harbor framework was fundamentally flawed because of its reliance on self-certification, the lack of appropriate policing and the &quot;Snowden effect.&quot; The court reasoned that even if the framework could be salvaged, the U.S. surveillance efforts by the NSA constituted a disproportionate interference with an EU citizen's right to privacy. As a result, companies were forced to put BCRs or model contract clauses in place, both of which were major undertakings for any company.1</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Privacy Shield</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Where does that leave a global company operating in the EU that needs to transfer data outside the EU in order to comply with litigation or regulatory requirements? In the wake of the invalidation of Safe Harbor, the U.S. Department of Commerce, the FTC and the EU Commission have now negotiated the proposed EU-U.S. Privacy Shield. It would establish a tighter framework for cross-border transfers. The Privacy Shield would not rely solely on self-certification for compliance monitoring and would impose greater reporting requirements on the covered entity. The Privacy Shield is currently under review by the EU member states and awaits final approval by the full commission.2</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While we await the outcome of the proposed Privacy Shield, if you will be doing business in the EU, there are some things you can do to prepare for compliance with the GDPR:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Data map: Engage in a data-mapping exercise so you understand where the EU personal data will live within your organization. Whether in your data center, with a third party in an outsourcing model, in a managed services environment or in the cloud, the privacy rules still apply. Your responsibility is not delegable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Define business needs: Understand what kind of cross-border transfers of personal data are likely to be routinely needed to advance legitimate business goals. If you expect a regular volume of transfers will be required, consider adopting BCRs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Assess data security: As you would with your own infrastructure, ensure that any third party or cloud provider meets industry standard security protocols, and contractually require that enumerated data security requirements are met.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anticipate a breach: Establish documented policies and procedures for data breach incidents and contractually require any third party or cloud provider to adhere to them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Make compliant transfers: If you are required to transfer personal data for a valid business reason, ensure that current requirements for cross-border transfer are met.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For practical in-house approaches, please consult The Sedona Conference &quot;Practical In-House Approaches for Cross-Border Discovery &amp; Data Protection.&quot;3</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1 The GDPR expressly recognizes BCRs, raising the expectation that they will rise in popularity for intra-company transfers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2 The Article 29 Working Party recently issued their opinion on the Privacy Shield. While acknowledging that it made some progress toward protecting the rights of EU citizens, it opined that it did not go far enough and recommended more work be done.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The European Parliament made international headlines in April when it enacted the General Data Protection Regulation, a revolutionary data privacy law that permits regulators to fine corporations in excess of <SPAN style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&#8364;</SPAN>20 million for noncompliance. What's more, companies without a physical presence in the European Union may be subject to regulation and liability. These changes usher in an era of uncertainty as U.S. companies assess the potential effects on their business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This article offers some background on recent developments in EU data privacy law, endeavors to answer some questions you may have regarding how the evolution of EU law affects your business, and suggests first steps that you can take to ensure compliance with the GDPR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What Sparked the EU's Data Privacy Changes?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The transformation of EU data privacy law encompasses two different concepts: regulation within the EU, and transfers of personal data outside the EU. Since 1995, the EU Data Protection Directive has regulated data privacy within the EU. By 2012, however, efforts were underway to replace the Directive, and the GDPR was proposed. In April 2016, after years of negotiation, the GDPR gained European Parliament approval, which was the final step in the legislative process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the realm of data transfers outside the EU, companies for years relied on an agreement between the EU and U.S. known as the Safe Harbor. In October 2015, however, a European court invalidated the Safe Harbor because it failed to adequately protect EU citizens' rights. Companies that relied on the Safe Harbor scrambled to find alternative ways to legalize data transfers, and the EU and U.S. rushed to negotiate a new data-transfer pact. Although the EU and U.S. reached an agreement known as the Privacy Shield, whether the Privacy Shield will take effect remains unclear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While most American companies' attention was focused on the upheaval surrounding invalidation of the Safe Harbor, the European Parliament thrust the GDPR to center stage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What Are the Significant GDPR Changes?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GDPR introduces significant changes to EU data privacy law, including a broader territorial scope, enhanced penalties and a shortened time frame for responding to data breaches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First, the GDPR regulates more businesses than the directive. The directive applied only to data &quot;controllers&quot; - that is, entities that &quot;determine[d] the purposes and means of the processing of personal data.&quot; In contrast, the GDPR applies to data &quot;processors,&quot; which process personal data on a controller's behalf. The GDPR also expands the definition of &quot;personal data&quot; to include a person's name, location data, online identifiers and genetic information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moreover, when data processing relates to offering goods or services to data subjects in the EU or monitoring data subjects' behavior in the EU, the GDPR extends even to controllers and processors who have no physical presence in the EU. The GDPR's extraterritorial reach marks a significant development EU data regulation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Second, the GDPR provides severe penalties for noncompliance. Administrative fines reach as high as 4 percent of a company's gross worldwide revenue or <SPAN style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&#8364;</SPAN>20 million - whichever is greater. Administrative fines must be &quot;effective, proportionate and dissuasive,&quot; and the supervisory authority imposing the fines must consider factors including the number of data subjects involved and extent of their injuries, whether a company acted intentionally or negligently, and whether a company took mitigating action. Given these factors, a company's deftness in preparing for and responding to data breaches will go a long way toward minimizing the amount of potential fines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Third, data controllers must notify supervisory authorities of a personal data breach within 72 hours of discovering the breach. This notification period is shorter than state-law notification periods with which U.S. companies are familiar, although the notification period is longer than the 24-hour period originally proposed in the GDPR. Additionally, controllers must notify data subjects &quot;without undue delay&quot; if the breach is likely to cause a &quot;high risk&quot; to individual rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The swift 72-hour notification period entails some ambiguity. In particular, the GDPR mandates that &quot;the controller shall without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours after having become aware of it, notify the personal data breach to the supervisory authority.&quot; Notification is not required, however, if the &quot;personal data breach is unlikely to result in a risk for the rights and freedoms of natural persons.&quot; Notification after 72 hours must be &quot;accompanied by reasons for the delay.&quot; The GDPR also imposes a notification requirement on the data processor, who &quot;shall notify the controller without undue delay after becoming aware of a personal data breach.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GDPR, however, does not define &quot;undue delay,&quot; describe situations in which notification within 72 hours is not &quot;feasible,&quot; or explain what constitutes an acceptable delay for late notification. Data controllers and supervisory authorities may also differ in their assessment of what constitutes a &quot;likely&quot; risk to individual rights. Thus, ambiguity exists, and supervisory authorities and European courts will likely fill in the blanks. The notification requirements underscore the importance of planning and preparing for data breach responses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Does the GDPR Impose Additional Obligations?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to notification requirements, the GDPR requires controllers and processors to implement an array of internal controls related to managing personal data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For starters, data controllers must &quot;implement appropriate technical and organisational measures&quot; to ensure GDPR compliance and protect individual rights. Similarly, controllers should not contract with processors without guarantees that the processors will take appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect individual rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Additionally, if a controller is not established in the EU, it must appoint a representative in an EU member nation where the controller offers goods or services or monitors data subjects' behaviors. An exemption exists, however, for companies that engage in occasional processing that is unlikely to threaten individual rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GDPR also imposes record-keeping requirements on controllers and processors. For instance, controllers must maintain a record of processing activities that includes the purpose of processing and a description of categories of data processed. Records must be produced to supervisory authorities on demand. Although an exemption exists for companies with fewer than 250 employees engaged in infrequent processing, what constitutes &quot;occasional&quot; processing remains to be seen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Companies engaged in large-scale processing - or in processing of data related to special categories, such as race, ethnicity and religion - must appoint a data protection officer. The data protection officer's responsibilities include monitoring compliance with the GDPR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Companies often rely on consent when processing personal data, and the GDPR sets forth new requirements for obtaining consent. Consent must be affirmative, freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous. A pop-up, click-through box on a website is a common way of obtaining consent and remains valid as long as it meets the GDPR's criteria. A data subject, however, must have a genuine choice, be aware of the controller's identity and the purpose of processing, and be able to withdraw consent at any time without detriment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What If We Transfer EU Data to the U.S.?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until last year, companies routinely relied on the Safe Harbor to legalize the transatlantic flow of EU citizens' personal data. In October 2015, however, the Court of Justice of the European Union invalidated the Safe Harbor because, in the CJEU's assessment, the Safe Harbor failed to adequately protect EU citizens' privacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CJEU's decision left many companies that relied on the Safe Harbor in legal limbo. In early February 2016, the European Commission announced that it had reached a new agreement with the U.S., called the Privacy Shield, to replace the Safe Harbor. Privacy advocates, however, criticized the Privacy Shield for not going far enough to protect personal data and individual rights. Following release of the Privacy Shield's text, a group of European data regulators - the Article 29 Working Party - disapproved of the Privacy Shield. Although the Working Party's opinion is not binding, many commentators expect that the Privacy Shield will not take effect absent significant revisions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The practical effect is that companies that transfer personal data from the EU to U.S. remain in legal limbo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the Safe Harbor was the most popular mechanism for transferring data from the EU, several alternatives exist, including binding corporate rules, standard contractual clauses and consent. The GDPR expressly recognizes these methods of transfer. Additionally, the European Commission can issue adequacy decisions declaring that a particular country provides an adequate level of data protection. A similar process existed under the Directive, but the Commission recognized only 11 nations - not including the U.S. - as providing adequate safeguards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thus, companies may still transfer data, but for the time being, they cannot rely on the Safe Harbor or Privacy Shield to do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is There Any Good News?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GDPR may seem burdensome, but it does have a silver lining. The GDPR is a &quot;regulation,&quot; not a &quot;directive.&quot; Unlike directives, regulations do not require implementing legislation from EU member nations. Thus, the GDPR will regulate data privacy throughout the EU. As a result, the GDPR may simplify the data privacy regulatory structure by providing one set of regulations for companies to deal with - a one-stop shop of sorts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Additionally, companies have about two years to prepare for the GDPR, which will take effect on May 25, 2018.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">European data privacy law remains in flux and is undergoing a period of transformation. This article describes some of the most significant developments with regard to the GDPR and Privacy Shield, but is far from comprehensive. As companies navigate these uncertain waters during times when data breaches have become increasingly common, planning and preparation are crucial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a first step toward complying with the GDPR, companies should take stock of their data operations. Ask the following questions: What personal data does my company collect or store, and how is it used? Do our activities fall within the scope of the GDPR? Do we meet the definition of a &quot;data processor&quot; or &quot;data controller&quot;? Do we have a high-level employee responsible for data security? Have we developed a data breach response plan?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prospect of fines exceeding <SPAN style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&#8364;</SPAN>20 million provides a strong incentive to invest in data security and breach response. A well-designed and well-executed data breach response plan may keep your company out of regulators' cross hairs. U.S. companies should therefore be proactive during the GDPR's implementation period and stay abreast of developments in the evolution of EU data privacy law.</SPAN></P>

The Privacy Shield is currently under review by the EU member states and awaits final approval by the full commission.2</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While we await the outcome of the proposed Privacy Shield, if you will be doing business in the EU, there are some things you can do to prepare for compliance with the GDPR:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Data map: Engage in a data-mapping exercise so you understand where the EU personal data will live within your organization. Whether in your data center, with a third party in an outsourcing model, in a managed services environment or in the cloud, the privacy rules still apply. Your responsibility is not delegable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Define business needs: Understand what kind of cross-border transfers of personal data are likely to be routinely needed to advance legitimate business goals. If you expect a regular volume of transfers will be required, consider adopting BCRs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Assess data security: As you would with your own infrastructure, ensure that any third party or cloud provider meets industry standard security protocols, and contractually require that enumerated data security requirements are met.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anticipate a breach: Establish documented policies and procedures for data breach incidents and contractually require any third party or cloud provider to adhere to them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Make compliant transfers: If you are required to transfer personal data for a valid business reason, ensure that current requirements for cross-border transfer are met.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1 The GDPR expressly recognizes BCRs, raising the expectation that they will rise in popularity for intra-company transfers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2 The Article 29 Working Party recently issued their opinion on the Privacy Shield. While acknowledging that it made some progress toward protecting the rights of EU citizens, it opined that it did not go far enough and recommended more work be done.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The European Parliament made international headlines in April when it enacted the General Data Protection Regulation, a revolutionary data privacy law that permits regulators to fine corporations in excess of <SPAN style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&#8364;</SPAN>20 million for noncompliance. What's more, companies without a physical presence in the European Union may be subject to regulation and liability. These changes usher in an era of uncertainty as U.S. companies assess the potential effects on their business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This article offers some background on recent developments in EU data privacy law, endeavors to answer some questions you may have regarding how the evolution of EU law affects your business, and suggests first steps that you can take to ensure compliance with the GDPR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What Sparked the EU's Data Privacy Changes?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The transformation of EU data privacy law encompasses two different concepts: regulation within the EU, and transfers of personal data outside the EU. Since 1995, the EU Data Protection Directive has regulated data privacy within the EU. By 2012, however, efforts were underway to replace the Directive, and the GDPR was proposed. In April 2016, after years of negotiation, the GDPR gained European Parliament approval, which was the final step in the legislative process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the realm of data transfers outside the EU, companies for years relied on an agreement between the EU and U.S. known as the Safe Harbor. In October 2015, however, a European court invalidated the Safe Harbor because it failed to adequately protect EU citizens' rights. Companies that relied on the Safe Harbor scrambled to find alternative ways to legalize data transfers, and the EU and U.S. rushed to negotiate a new data-transfer pact. Although the EU and U.S. reached an agreement known as the Privacy Shield, whether the Privacy Shield will take effect remains unclear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While most American companies' attention was focused on the upheaval surrounding invalidation of the Safe Harbor, the European Parliament thrust the GDPR to center stage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What Are the Significant GDPR Changes?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GDPR introduces significant changes to EU data privacy law, including a broader territorial scope, enhanced penalties and a shortened time frame for responding to data breaches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First, the GDPR regulates more businesses than the directive. The directive applied only to data &quot;controllers&quot; - that is, entities that &quot;determine[d] the purposes and means of the processing of personal data.&quot; In contrast, the GDPR applies to data &quot;processors,&quot; which process personal data on a controller's behalf. The GDPR also expands the definition of &quot;personal data&quot; to include a person's name, location data, online identifiers and genetic information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moreover, when data processing relates to offering goods or services to data subjects in the EU or monitoring data subjects' behavior in the EU, the GDPR extends even to controllers and processors who have no physical presence in the EU. The GDPR's extraterritorial reach marks a significant development EU data regulation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Second, the GDPR provides severe penalties for noncompliance. Administrative fines reach as high as 4 percent of a company's gross worldwide revenue or <SPAN style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&#8364;</SPAN>20 million - whichever is greater. Administrative fines must be &quot;effective, proportionate and dissuasive,&quot; and the supervisory authority imposing the fines must consider factors including the number of data subjects involved and extent of their injuries, whether a company acted intentionally or negligently, and whether a company took mitigating action. Given these factors, a company's deftness in preparing for and responding to data breaches will go a long way toward minimizing the amount of potential fines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Third, data controllers must notify supervisory authorities of a personal data breach within 72 hours of discovering the breach. This notification period is shorter than state-law notification periods with which U.S. companies are familiar, although the notification period is longer than the 24-hour period originally proposed in the GDPR. Additionally, controllers must notify data subjects &quot;without undue delay&quot; if the breach is likely to cause a &quot;high risk&quot; to individual rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The swift 72-hour notification period entails some ambiguity. In particular, the GDPR mandates that &quot;the controller shall without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours after having become aware of it, notify the personal data breach to the supervisory authority.&quot; Notification is not required, however, if the &quot;personal data breach is unlikely to result in a risk for the rights and freedoms of natural persons.&quot; Notification after 72 hours must be &quot;accompanied by reasons for the delay.&quot; The GDPR also imposes a notification requirement on the data processor, who &quot;shall notify the controller without undue delay after becoming aware of a personal data breach.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GDPR, however, does not define &quot;undue delay,&quot; describe situations in which notification within 72 hours is not &quot;feasible,&quot; or explain what constitutes an acceptable delay for late notification. Data controllers and supervisory authorities may also differ in their assessment of what constitutes a &quot;likely&quot; risk to individual rights. Thus, ambiguity exists, and supervisory authorities and European courts will likely fill in the blanks. The notification requirements underscore the importance of planning and preparing for data breach responses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Does the GDPR Impose Additional Obligations?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to notification requirements, the GDPR requires controllers and processors to implement an array of internal controls related to managing personal data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For starters, data controllers must &quot;implement appropriate technical and organisational measures&quot; to ensure GDPR compliance and protect individual rights. Similarly, controllers should not contract with processors without guarantees that the processors will take appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect individual rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Additionally, if a controller is not established in the EU, it must appoint a representative in an EU member nation where the controller offers goods or services or monitors data subjects' behaviors. An exemption exists, however, for companies that engage in occasional processing that is unlikely to threaten individual rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GDPR also imposes record-keeping requirements on controllers and processors. For instance, controllers must maintain a record of processing activities that includes the purpose of processing and a description of categories of data processed. Records must be produced to supervisory authorities on demand. Although an exemption exists for companies with fewer than 250 employees engaged in infrequent processing, what constitutes &quot;occasional&quot; processing remains to be seen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Companies engaged in large-scale processing - or in processing of data related to special categories, such as race, ethnicity and religion - must appoint a data protection officer. The data protection officer's responsibilities include monitoring compliance with the GDPR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Companies often rely on consent when processing personal data, and the GDPR sets forth new requirements for obtaining consent. Consent must be affirmative, freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous. A pop-up, click-through box on a website is a common way of obtaining consent and remains valid as long as it meets the GDPR's criteria. A data subject, however, must have a genuine choice, be aware of the controller's identity and the purpose of processing, and be able to withdraw consent at any time without detriment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What If We Transfer EU Data to the U.S.?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until last year, companies routinely relied on the Safe Harbor to legalize the transatlantic flow of EU citizens' personal data. In October 2015, however, the Court of Justice of the European Union invalidated the Safe Harbor because, in the CJEU's assessment, the Safe Harbor failed to adequately protect EU citizens' privacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CJEU's decision left many companies that relied on the Safe Harbor in legal limbo. In early February 2016, the European Commission announced that it had reached a new agreement with the U.S., called the Privacy Shield, to replace the Safe Harbor. Privacy advocates, however, criticized the Privacy Shield for not going far enough to protect personal data and individual rights. Following release of the Privacy Shield's text, a group of European data regulators - the Article 29 Working Party - disapproved of the Privacy Shield. Although the Working Party's opinion is not binding, many commentators expect that the Privacy Shield will not take effect absent significant revisions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The practical effect is that companies that transfer personal data from the EU to U.S. remain in legal limbo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the Safe Harbor was the most popular mechanism for transferring data from the EU, several alternatives exist, including binding corporate rules, standard contractual clauses and consent. The GDPR expressly recognizes these methods of transfer. Additionally, the European Commission can issue adequacy decisions declaring that a particular country provides an adequate level of data protection. A similar process existed under the Directive, but the Commission recognized only 11 nations - not including the U.S. - as providing adequate safeguards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thus, companies may still transfer data, but for the time being, they cannot rely on the Safe Harbor or Privacy Shield to do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is There Any Good News?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GDPR may seem burdensome, but it does have a silver lining. The GDPR is a &quot;regulation,&quot; not a &quot;directive.&quot; Unlike directives, regulations do not require implementing legislation from EU member nations. Thus, the GDPR will regulate data privacy throughout the EU. As a result, the GDPR may simplify the data privacy regulatory structure by providing one set of regulations for companies to deal with - a one-stop shop of sorts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Additionally, companies have about two years to prepare for the GDPR, which will take effect on May 25, 2018.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">European data privacy law remains in flux and is undergoing a period of transformation. This article describes some of the most significant developments with regard to the GDPR and Privacy Shield, but is far from comprehensive. As companies navigate these uncertain waters during times when data breaches have become increasingly common, planning and preparation are crucial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a first step toward complying with the GDPR, companies should take stock of their data operations. Ask the following questions: What personal data does my company collect or store, and how is it used? Do our activities fall within the scope of the GDPR? Do we meet the definition of a &quot;data processor&quot; or &quot;data controller&quot;? Do we have a high-level employee responsible for data security? Have we developed a data breach response plan?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prospect of fines exceeding <SPAN style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&#8364;</SPAN>20 million provides a strong incentive to invest in data security and breach response. A well-designed and well-executed data breach response plan may keep your company out of regulators' cross hairs. U.S. companies should therefore be proactive during the GDPR's implementation period and stay abreast of developments in the evolution of EU data privacy law.</SPAN></P>
